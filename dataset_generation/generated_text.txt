The Politics of Disease Epidemics: a Comparative Analysis of the SARS, Zika, and Ebola Outbreaks

Over the past few decades, disease outbreaks have become increasingly frequent and widespread. The epicenters of these outbreaks have differed, and could be linked to different economic contexts. Arguably, the responses to these outbreaks have been Bpolitical^and inherently burdensome to marginalized populations. Key lessons can be learned from exploring the narratives about the different epidemics in varying income settings. Based on a review of the published medical, social, and political literature, which was accessed using four electronic databases-PubMed, Sociological Abstracts, Scholars Portal, and Web of Science, the overall objective of this paper discuss scholars' narratives on the Bpolitics^of Ebola in a low-income setting, Zika virus in a middle-income setting, and SARS in a high-income setting. Various themes of the politics of epidemics were prominent in the literature. The narratives demonstrated the influence of power in whose narratives and what narratives are presented in the literature. While marginalized populations were reported to have borne the brunt of all disease outbreaks in the different contexts, the prevalence of their narratives within the reviewed literature was limited. Regardless of income setting, there is a need to give voice to the most marginalized communities during an epidemic. The experiences and narratives of those most vulnerable to an epidemic-specifically poor communities-need to be represented in the literature. This could contribute to mitigating some of the negative impact of the politics in epidemics.

Infectious diseases are responsible for 25% of the annual global deaths (Dry and Leach 2010) . Epidemics arising from these diseases are unpredictable, carry uncertain, varying risks, and narratives in different contexts (Scoones 2010) . It is important that the scholarly literature represents the diverse and sometimes competing, narratives from all affected particularly the most vulnerable (Dry and Leach 2010) . Arguably, national and global responses to epidemics are inherently political. The experts selected for consultation, the evidence used to inform response pathways, and narratives of blame, vulnerability, and responsibility are politically driven, and require analysis.

In this paper, epidemics refer to a spike, above normal, in the prevalence of a specific disease in a specific population (Centre for Disease Control and Prevention 2012). The literal definition of politics is the Bactivities that relate to influencing the actions and policies of a government or getting and keeping power in a government^ (Merriam-Webster 2016) . However, in the Bpolitics of epidemics^literature, politics often refers to the extensive and diverse influence of local, national, and international governments and organizations, on the health outcomes of communities during disease outbreaks. For the purposes of this paper, politics will also refer to how scholars talked about epidemics, and whose narratives are reported in the reviewed literature.

Several key themes emerge when examining scholarly narratives about the politics of epidemics namely the socioeconomic distribution of disease, decision-making in research and development, the credibility of evidence that informs response pathways, and attribution of responsibility for causing the outbreak and determining who is responsible for responding. While the literature presents obviously competing narratives that explain disease outbreaks, a close examination of these reveals a high prevalence of certain narratives, which reflect the influence of power and privilege. Hence, some of the literature has called for increased representation of the narratives from the most marginalized populations who bear the brunt of epidemics, in the scholarly literature (Dry and Leach 2010; Nightingale 2010) .

Furthermore, the decisions with regard to the type of research, the study population and the research beneficiaries often lack transparency, are also dominated by the most powerful. The case of the swine flu, dubbed the Bpandemic that never really was^ (Evans 2010; Bonneux and Van Damme 2010) , demonstrates the potential consequences of private and uncommunicated decision-making processes in research and development. In the case of the swine flu, allegedly scientists conducting research and advising the World Health Organization on the virus were compensated by drug companies. This may have introduced bias (Evans, 2010, p. 296) . By increasing fear of a global pandemic, scientific research funded by pharmaceutical companies justified the stockpiling of antiviral supplies, thus increasing their vaccine sales (Evans 2010) .

Fear mongering has been criticized in the literature, since it has the potential to distort the evidence, which should guide credible decision-making. It is therefore critical to assess the credibility and quality of the evidence that is being used to inform the response to epidemics around the world, particularly in light of the complicated and often problematic relationship between the academic and industry (Bonneux and Van Damme 2010) . In determining the credibility of evidence, consideration should be given to the legitimacy and authority of its producer(s).

The literature identifies discourse with regard to the attribution of responsibility; who is to blame for the outbreak and who should response? Some of this literature assigned the blame and responsibility, for the outbreak, to people's cultures (Dong 2008; Morinet et al. 2016) , which oversimplifies complex issues that result from complex processes, such as globalization, climate change, and global economics. This kind of narrative reflects the politics of blame, which typically attributes responsibility for the sources of the outbreak to a cultural minority group and neglects the influence of colonialism and the social determinants of health, including overcrowding, poor sanitation, and poverty that increase these people's vulnerability (Dry and Leach 2010) .

Given these sociopolitical issues that characterize epidemics, a comparative analysis of the narratives on the politics of epidemics is relevant. To date, most of the narratives in the scholarly literature on the politics of epidemics have considered one epidemic in one context (Dong 2008; Morinet et al. 2016; Nyenswah et al. 2014) . We hypothesize that the narratives may vary depending on the kind and context of the epidemic.

The overall aim of this review paper is to discuss the scholarly narratives on the politics of disease epidemics by diseases and income level; Ebola in a low-income setting, Zika in a middle-income setting, and SARS in a high-income setting (Table 1 ). This analysis allowed for the consideration of the role that socioeconomic, geographical, and cultural context might play in the narratives on the attribution of blame and response to disease outbreaks.

The paper is based on a review of the peer-reviewed published medical, social, and political literature, which was accessed using four electronic databases-PubMed, Sociological Abstracts, Scholars Portal, and Web of Science. The search was limited to full text articles published between 2002 and 2017.

A similar approach was used in identifying the relevant articles. For each epidemic, the search terms included the name of the disease outbreak and the country of interest: BSARS AND Toronto,^BZika AND Brazil,^and BEbola AND Liberia.^It was vital that each search included the income setting to ensure that the findings were contextually relevant. These terms were then combined with the terms Bsociet*,^Bsociol*,^and Bpolitic*.^Truncation was used to ensure inclusion of all terms, including Bsociety,^Bsocietal,B sociological,^Bsociology,^Bpolitics,^Bpolitical,B politician,^and Bpoliticization.^The search terms must have Tables 2, 3, and 4 summarize the search results for the three outbreaks within the specified contexts. The titles and abstracts of the search results were reviewed for relevance to the politics of epidemics. All biomedical articles describing biomedical research were excluded. All articles that were relevant to the study topic were retrieved and reviewed. The initial review involved RA, grouping the search results according to the disease outbreak. For each outbreak, RA first scanned through a couple of papers, identifying the emerging themes. Once these were identified, subsequent reviews were structured along these themes, although an open stance was maintained throughout to enable the reviewer to identify any additional relevant themes.

The four themes socioeconomic distribution of disease, decision-making in research and development, the credibility of evidence that informs response pathways, and the attribution of infectious disease responsibility, (outlined in the introduction), were used to guide the synthesis of the information from the literature. For consistency, detailed discussions are limited to the findings that are directly related to the politics of epidemics, as defined in this paper.

This review focused on the SARs epidemic in Canada, specifically Toronto, Ontario; to represent an epidemic in a high income country. Table 2 summarizes the search results.

The literature on SARS spoke to two of the four themes of the politics of epidemics, namely the credibility of evidence informing response pathways and the attribution of infectious disease responsibility.

Evidence is deemed credible if it is scientifically rigorous, and the legitimacy and authority of its producer. The credibility of the evidence used to guide some of the response decisions to SARS was questionable. Specific examples include the use of quarantine (Holm 2009; Jacobs 2007; Tracy et al. 2009 ) and travel advisories (Paquin 2007) both locally and globally.

The use of quarantine as a control measure, although considered to be highly effective, is controversial. A telephonebased survey in the Greater Toronto Area aiming to ascertain public perceptions of the use of quarantine found that while quarantine was perceived to be a necessary and effective strategy, its ethical implementation should involve the collaboration of policy-makers, public health organizations, and the general population, and should be closely regulated to ensure appropriate use and protection of individual rights (Tracy et al. 2009 ). Despite these recommendations, Toronto quarantined significantly more people during the SARS outbreak compared to the other affected cities, including Hong Kong and Shanghai (Jacobs 2007) . Given the reported psychological distress reported by those quarantined, Toronto might have considered other strategies, such as the use of face masks to better Bdistribute the burden of containment measures ( Jacob, 2007, p. 532) . Critics note that the extensive quarantining in Toronto lacked proper policies and procedures to guide its implementation (Jacobs 2007) . Others highlight a lack of public record detailing any consultation between public health officials and the Ontario Human Rights Commission (Jacobs 2007) . There was little public scrutiny, which was suggested to be the result of effective conditioning of the public consciousness to believe that quarantining recommendations would be made fairly and legitimately by senior public health officials (Jacobs 2007) . Ultimately, it was not quarantining that was problematic, but the lack of apparent or sufficient evidence to guide its implementation. Beyond extensive quarantining, The World Health Organization issued travel-advisories as an additional control measure to contain further national and international spread of SARS from Toronto (Paquin 2007) . This travel-advisory cost Toronto $1.1 billion and restricted the international right for freedom of movement (Paquin 2007) . Paquin (2009) criticizes these travel-advisories for various reasons. For example, the advisories were not made by the WHO in consultation with Toronto authorities and led to an uneven global distribution of the burden of SARS (Paquin 2007) . Furthermore, the travel advisories were based on old data resulting from delayed communication between the federal government of Canada and the WHO, as information had to first travel from municipal to provincial to federal health authorities (Paquin 2007) . Once again, the evidence used to inform the response was outdated and therefore considered unjustified. As such, there were problems with both the lack of quality evidence and the travel advisory as a response.

Quarantining and travel advisories reflect the profound ethical and political implications inherent in responding to infectious disease outbreaks. The evidence on the efficacy of the two primary responses-quarantining and travel advisorieswas inadequate to justify the extent of their implementation.

In the case of SARS in Toronto, the literature reported on both forms of responsibility. While some of the literature attributed the responsibility to the Canadian health care system for being unprepared to manage SARS, the other literature tended to (or report on the) how the public attributed blame to the Asian-Canadian community for Bbringing^the outbreak. The latter narratives ultimately led to the racialization of the epidemic. 

The narratives on attribution of responsibility for managing the SARs outbreak is most prevalent in the literature, with the limited capacity of the Canadian Health Care System to prepare for and respond to an emerging infectious disease as a main narrative. Many scholars pointed to flaws in the funding and organization of Canada's health care system-federally, provincially, and municipally-to explain the SARS outbreak in Toronto. Some argued that information was communicated inefficiently and was often incorrect (Silas et al. 2006) . Personal protective equipment was in short supply (Summers 2009) , and the use of occupational health and safety in Toronto's hospital system was inefficient, leading to further spread (Silas et al. 2006 ). Toronto's hospital system was also blamed for lacking admission policies and public laboratories (Wong et al. 2007) : an inability to supply health services when demand suddenly increased and a lack of quality leadership (Arya et al. 2009 ). Toronto was also ill-prepared to address the unique vulnerability of the homeless to SARS (Leung et al. 2008) .

Inadequate collaboration between the various levels of government in Canada was blamed for the apparent inefficiencies and inadequacies in the functioning of the health care system and the response to public health crises. This led to disorganized contact tracing, quarantining, and communication to the public (MacDougall 2007). Financial challenges within the Canadian Health Care System further enhanced Toronto's vulnerability to the SARS epidemic, including a lack of resourcing towards public health infrastructure and acute care (Salehi and Ali 2006) . Similar to MacDougall (2007), Salehi and Ali (2006) point to a lack of cooperation and collaboration between the three levels of government to explain this public health crisis-ownership of responsibility and duty to respond was deflected between each level and remained unclear (MacDougall 2007; Salehi and Ali 2006) .

Another sub-theme that emerged from the literature was the impact of globalization on local preparedness, prevention strategies, but more importantly, on the attribution of blame for the spread of the outbreak. While there is emphasis, in the narrative on SARs, for municipal governments to consider the globalized nature of the outbreak; (Keil and Ali 2007) , consistent with the politics of epidemics literature, which asserts that blame is typically placed on cultural and ethnic minority groups, significant blame was placed on the Asian-Canadian community.

According to the literature, SARS quickly became a profoundly racialized disease and inflamed racial tensions in the Greater Toronto Area ultimately leading to the social exclusion of a racial minority-the Asian-Canadian group (Jacobs 2007) . Such avoidance and stigmatization is reported to have played out in several spaces, such as on public transit and other public spaces, and families advising children to avoid Chinese peers in school (Jacobs 2007) . Some of the literature posits that this racialized stereotyping could have been prevented with denunciation from leaders in government and public health (Jacobs 2007) .On the other hand, according to Ali (2008) , individualized health behaviors aimed at preventing SARS contraction-for instance, wearing a face mask-may have justified the avoidance of the stigmatized of the Asian-Canadians (Ali 2008) . Culture and ethnicity functioned not only as a risk factor for discrimination but also as a facilitator in the response to the outbreak. The Chinese-Canadian community in Toronto employed numerous strategies to combat SARS and ease social anxieties, including fundraising for research, the dissemination of health promotion materials, and launching a SARS support line, among other activities (Dong 2008) . The mobilization of spiritual leaders was also found to be an effective means of disseminating public health information (Faust et al. 2009 ). While it is important to recognize the contributions of cultural and ethnic groups, we assert that cultural and ethnic minority groups are more often targets of blame, as was the case for SARS in Toronto. Table 3 summarizes the total number of hits, and the number of papers that were retrieved and reviewed. The reviewed literature spoke to all of the themes identified in the politics of epidemics literature (socioeconomic distribution of disease, credibility of evidence, and the attribution of infectious disease responsibility), with the exception of decision-making in research and development.

Similar to the above outbreaks, the people who were most affected by Zika were in some way socially marginalized, the poor, and more specifically, poor women. At the global level, it was the poorer countries and communities within those regions that were most impacted: those with precarious and/or inconsistent access to health care services, lacking the resources and infrastructure to prevent, diagnose, and treat the virus (Plourde and Bloch 2016; Slavov et al. 2016) . No wonder the impact of the outbreak was more devastating in Brazil, which was already financially strained prior to the emergence of the Zika virus, with limited human resources: doctors, nurses, and other specialists (Hennigan 2016) , as compared to higher income countries who were more protected from the effects of the Zika virus given effective prevention programs, funding, and infrastructure (Gyawali et al. 2016) . Easy and extensive access to mosquito repellants, air conditioning, effective waste management programs, and low rates of urban crowding protect more economically developed countries, such as the USA from Zika transmission (Plourde and Bloch 2016) . Consequently, Zika virus has aptly been labeled an Binfectious disease of poverty^ (Gyawali et al., 2016, p. 3) (Gyawali et al. 2016) .

Some of the literature attributed the lack of public health infrastructure and resources to respond to the Zika outbreak in Brazil to these inequalities with regard to who is most affected. Contrasting Zika with HIV, since HIV/AIDS initially affected the prestigious population, such as celebrities, doctors, scientists (Lotufo 2016) , they were able to advocate and secure increased public funding of HIV interventions from the Ministry of Health and State Departments of Health. However, this seems to have happened at the expense of funding for vector control programs, such as those controlling mosquito vectors responsible for the transmission of dengue and Zika viruses, which mostly affected poorer communities (Lotufo 2016) .

Among the poor populations, women who were either pregnant or considering pregnancy were also more vulnerable to the effects of Zika, as the virus is considered to be a teratogen (Mazzu-Nascimento et al. 2017) . Government programs in Brazil that intend to provide free mosquito repellent to pregnant women do not consistently reach some of the poorest communities, such communities are remote and often lack accessible quality health care facilities due to distance and poor physical infrastructure (Hennigan 2016) . Access to quality reproductive health care is essential given the accumulating evidence linking the Zika virus to a rise in cases of infants born with microcephaly-an unusually small head for age and sex (World Health Organization 2017a). Conditions related to poverty, such as poor sanitation and increased exposure to larvicides and insecticides, which may cause mutation, have also been implicated (Diniz 2016) .

The relationship between the Zika virus and pregnancy is further implicated by social inequalities in the context of reproductive rights and freedoms. Access to reproductive health services, such as contraception and abortion are discouraged or illegal in many epidemic countries (Plourde and Bloch 2016) . Tavares & Foster (2016) suggest that Bthis public health emergency offers a window of opportunity to advance national policies and practices to ensure that Brazilian women have access to a full range of reproductive health services^(p. 109) (Tavares and Foster 2016) . This speaks to the inherent politicization of the Zika epidemic.

The evidence and the diversity of causal explanations of the Zika epidemic are arguably political. There are competing narratives that, if considered, justify different responses. These are exemplified in relationship to international human travel, climate change, ecosystem, and socioecology. The following is a brief overview of some theories of causation of the Zika epidemic.

International human travel is thought to have facilitated the spread of the Zika epidemic. The Zika virus was thought to have been introduced to South America between May and December 2013. During this time, there were three major international events held in Brazil-World Youth Day in July 2013, the Fifa World Cup in 2014, and the World Sprint Championship Canoe Race in Rio de Janeiro in 2014-that may have been responsible for this introduction (Possas 2016) . The World Sprint Championship Canoe Race in Rio de Janeiro was attended by a team from French Polynesia, where the Zika outbreak first occurred (Possas 2016; Gautret and Simon 2016) . These types of mass gatherings attracting international travelers put attendees at greater risk for transmission of communicable diseases (Gautret and Simon 2016; World Health Organization 2017b) . Despite these risks, the WHO only advised pregnant women and women planning to get pregnant to avoid traveling to Zikaaffected regions but did not implement a travel ban (Lima-Camara 2016).

While the climate of South America is particularly suitable for replication of the Aedes mosquito-the vector responsible for transmission of the Zika virus (Gyawali et al. 2016 ), climate change is thought to have resulted in extremely heavy rainfall and droughts which can support this proliferation of mosquitos, hence facilitating the spread of the Zika epidemic (Fast et al. 2015) . Both the puddles created during heavy rainfall and the open barrel water storage during droughts, create ideal breeding places for mosquitos (Fast et al. 2015) . Since the causes of climate change are complex, global, and political, the responses are political, often emphasizing the symptoms of climate change at a local level (in especially the poor countries), rather than addressing the causes at a global level.

A combination of an ecosystem-focused perspective and a social-anthropological lens is vital Bbecause a pathogen requires a receptive population in order to cause disease ( Possas, 2016, p. 8) (Possas 2016) . Ultimately, the need for a cross-disciplinary response pathway cannot be understated (Possas 2016) .

Comprehending the diversity of causal explanations and associated responses allows for the politics of evidence to be more deeply appreciated. The production and evaluation of the evidence used to provide a causal explanation and promote a response is also political.

In the case of the Zika epidemic, most of the literature on the attribution of infectious disease responsibility focused primarily on the cause, rather than the response, with most of the literature suggesting that globalization was responsible for the spread of Zika.

Although typically the blame of the origins of infectious diseases are typically placed on a cultural minority group (Hagan et al. 2015; Kobayashi et al. 2015; Phua 2015 ; World Health Organization 2017c), with response action emphasizing individual behavior, prevention of mosquito bites and sexual transmission (World Health Organization 2017d; Brym and Lie 2014), however, arguably, in the case of the Zika epidemic, considerable responsibility was given to the effects of globalization. Globalization has been defined in numerous ways. For example, Bryn and Lie (2014) defined it as the Brapid increases in the volume of international trade, travel, and communication [which has] broken down the isolation and independence of most countries and people^(pg. 27) (Imperato 2016) . This interpretation of globalization will be used of the purposes of this review. According to the literature, the interconnectedness between countries through travel facilitated the spread of Zika beyond the Zika Forest of Uganda-where it was initially discovered in the 1940s-to South East Asia in the 1960s, the Island of Yap in 2007, French Polynesia in 2013, and South America in 2015 (Gyawali et al. 2016; Imperato 2016) .

In addition to travel, other factors related to globalization, such as urbanization and human activities are also thought to have facilitated the spread of mosquito borne diseases, such as Zika. The global movement of humans and goods via international trade and the convenience of air travel have supported the ongoing spread of the Zika virus (World Health Organization 2017e). Analyses of the number of international travelers departing from Brazil and of the direction of spread of dengue and chikungunya suggest that Zika will continue to spread across South America into the Caribbean and the Southern USA (Gyawali et al. 2016) .

In light of the profound influence of globalization, international human travel, climate change, and urbanization on the spread of the Zika virus, some of the literature has called for research that assesses the feasibility of a more global response to preventing spread. Table 4 summarizes the literature included in the review of Ebola in Liberia. Liberia was the focus for the purposes of this systematic review because of its high prevalence of Ebola in comparison to other affected areas. Similar to Zika, the reviewed literature spoke to all of the themes identified in the politics of epidemics literature (socioeconomic distribution of disease and the attribution of infectious disease responsibility), with the exception of decision-making in research and development.

Ebola virus disease has been predominantly reported in lowincome countries, with the last outbreak in 2014 reported to have caused 11,323 deaths worldwide and 4809 deaths in Liberia alone (Abramowitz et al. 2015) . The most affected countries typically had poor health infrastructure (Arima and Shimada 2014; Burkle and Burkle 2015; McNamara 2016; Maras and Miranda 2016) . It is only during the most recent outbreak that the virus spread to high-income countries (Burkle and Burkle 2015; Stanturf et al. 2015) . Within these countries, and as was exemplified in Liberia, the outbreak mostly affected those populations that were very poor, remote, and lacked proper physical infrastructure, including roads, proper sanitation, and health facilities.

The burden of the Ebola epidemic fell disproportionately on the most disadvantaged Liberians, fundamentally politicizing the epidemic. The socioeconomic distribution of Ebola was political, as defined for the purposes of this review, in that many scholars attribute its emergence to the socioeconomic conditions of Liberia. For example, poverty, and subsequent limited investment into the health system led to weak public health infrastructure, insufficient information technologies, a lack of trained personnel, inadequate case reporting, was often cited as the key vulnerability of Liberia (Burkle and Burkle 2015; McNamara 2016; Maras and Miranda 2016; Scott et al. 2016) . Additional challenges included mobility of particular populations, authority distrust , economic instability, and a lack of governance (McNamara 2016). These challenges intersected with other stressors, such as climate change and food insecurity to intensify the effects of the Ebola epidemic (Scott et al. 2016 ). Many rural communities in Liberia were particularly vulnerable, extremely poor, and lacking secure access to food and health clinics (Scott et al. 2016) .

Similar to the other epidemics, people living in poverty were most vulnerable to the effects of the Ebola epidemic. Poverty facilitated the spread of the Ebola virus; thus, interventions aimed at addressing poverty would be most effective in containing further transmission (Pellecchia et al. 2015) . Socioeconomic inequality was additionally evident in the Binequitable management of the dead^(Pellecchia, Crestani, Decroo, Van en Bergh, Al-Kourdi, 2015, p. 1) (Garbuglia 2016) . While cremation was a less acceptable cultural practice (Kobayashi et al. 2015) , it was mandated to limit further Ebola transmission (Garbuglia 2016) . The new practice seemed to have impacted the economically disadvantaged who could not afford to pay for private burial services instead of cremation, aggravating socioeconomic divides (Garbuglia 2016) .

These issues frame the Ebola epidemic in Liberia as political as the operational processes at the local, national, and international organizations had a negative impact on the most vulnerable Liberians. Given this context of vulnerability, many scholars investigated the response pathways undertaken.

The legitimacy and authority of the producer of evidence determines its credibility. Theoretically, the evidence used to guide response pathways during an epidemic should be credible by these measures. Most of the literature reviewed alluded to the fact that the evidence used to inform the responses during the Ebola epidemic in Liberia was inadequate, leading to a critique of global organizations' responses. For example, some analysts argued that the epidemiological studies necessary to identify the source of Ebola virus were insufficient, leading to the ongoing emergence of the epidemic (Davies and Rushton 2016) . Furthermore, the United Nation's Security Council was criticized for not using the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) to its full capacity in responding to the Ebola epidemic in addition to accusations of an overdue response (Roemer-Mahler and Rushton 2016).

The disorganized and delayed response has been labeled a global health governance failure by Roemer-Mahler and Rushton (2016) who argue that Bthe outbreak was not only a global health problem but also a global political problem^(p. 374) (Siegel 2015) . Siegel (2015) echoes a similar criticism in noting that development aid was used in contexts with insufficient infrastructures for the aid to be effective and focused too heavily on issues unrelated to Ebola (Nunes 2016) . The international responses are argued to be far too short term, framing the Ebola epidemic as an African, and therefore racialized problem (Jones 2011) , leading to global neglect of the disease. This scholarly evaluation of global responses to the Ebola virus politicizes the epidemic, calling into question the evidence used to inform response pathways, which were largely insufficient and inappropriate for the Liberian context. More credible sources of evidence would have considered the urgency of Ebola and the unique sociopolitical context in which it was spreading.

The Liberian culture was blamed not only for causing the epidemic but for interfering with control measures. Jones (2014) criticizes this Bculturalist epidemiology^(pg. 1) that overlooks the wider global forces that promote the spread of Ebola, instead exoticizing Liberian culture to attribute responsibility (Blair et al. 2017) . For example, traditional burial practices and the consumption of bush meat were identified as key etiological factors to the Ebola epidemic . Some analysts even suggest that these cultural practices, in addition to local distrust of authorities may have obstructed interventions (Phua 2015; World Health Organization 2017c; Cordner et al. 2017) . Therefore, population behaviors, such as education and safe burials and cremations, were proposed as targets for intervention (Hagan et al. 2015; Alexander et al. 2015) .

However, other proposed causes of the Ebola epidemic included seasonal triggers, infection of nonhuman primates, landscape modification by humans, poverty, inadequate public health infrastructure, conflict, and population growth (Farmer 1996) . Failure to focus on these and narrowly focusing on cultural practices politicizes the Ebola epidemic; yet, public health authorities, governments, and academics have largely attributed disease responsibility to local culture.

Based on the literature on the politics of disease epidemics, four key themes emerged: (1) the socioeconomic distribution of disease, (2) decision-making in research and development, (3) the credibility of evidence that informs response pathways, and (4) the attribution of infectious disease responsibility. These were used to analyze the narratives of the politics of SARs, Zika, and Ebola in Canada, Brazil, and Liberia respectively, in the peer-reviewed literature (Table 5) .

There were similarities and differences in the narratives about the different epidemics. Broadly, none of the epidemics had narratives relating to all four themes of the politics of epidemics. However, both Zika and Ebola had narratives on three of the four themes. The SARs literature addressed only two of the four themes. Notably, there was lack of relevant literature on the research and development theme.

The finding that the literature on how decisions about what research is funded and conducted during disease epidemics almost exclusively focused on the ethical implications (and did not question the potential power imbalances with regard to who identified the research issue/question and who led the research for example), was surprising, since this was a key theme in the broad politics of epidemics literature. This could, in part, be a reflection of the limitations of the search engines and strategy used in the study which excluded publications, which were deemed biomedical. Conversely, it may be a reflection of limited support for critical research and related publications.

A case-specific review of the literature has demonstrated the influence of power and privilege on the experience of an epidemic. In the case of Zika in Brazil, the communities most vulnerable to the virus are those with insufficient resources and infrastructure (Plourde and Bloch 2016) . Consequently, Zika has been socially distributed to exacerbate conditions of poverty. However, the voices of these most affected people are drowned out by more powerful and prestigious groups. This is seen in the comparison that Lotufo (2016) makes between the politics of HIV/AIDS and the politics of Zika (Lotufo 2016) . HIV/AIDS research in Brazil procured greater funding because those affected tended to be very notable Brazilians with more dominant social and politics voices (Lotufo 2016) . The same pattern was reported in relationship to the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, where weak public health infrastructure aggravated Liberian experiences of Ebola (Burkle and Burkle 2015; McNamara 2016; Maras and Miranda 2016; Scott et al. 2016) , while interventions targeted cultural practices, ultimately disempowering the economically disadvantaged (Garbuglia 2016) .

This review found that infectious disease outbreaks disproportionately affect the poor, specifically communities with poor physical infrastructure and limited access to quality public health services. The link between income and politics of epidemics has been discussed in the social science literature, where poverty is perceived to be the greatest risk factor. For example, Farmer (1996) argued that disease outbreaks, e.g., Ebola systematically affecting poor people and are tied to regional trade networks (Alsan et al. 2011) . Building on this literature, Marcella (2011) uses the term structural violence to highlight the institutional biases, inequalities, and economic policies that emanate from global centers of power and privilege, which tend to marginalize poor people during outbreaks . These linkages highlight social and economic inequalities (within communities, societies and countries), which are complex and often ignored by the medical (and political) communities (Alsan et al. 2011; Leach et al. 2010) . Indeed, some of the narratives criticized the (epidemiological) evidence, which tends to overlook the role of poverty in the facilitation of disease spread. For instance, focusing on pregnancy in the case of Zika in Brazil was criticized for overlooking the conditions of poverty that might also/instead be responsible for the spike in cases of microcephaly (Diniz 2016) . Furthermore, responding to Ebola in Liberia with developmental aid that is not designed for contexts with insufficient infrastructure was criticized again for overlooking the role of poverty (Nunes 2016) . This limited focus on the role of poverty in the peer-reviewed medical literature calls into question the politics of the research process itself. For example, what institutions are funding the research and what are the interests of the stakeholders in the research process? Who gets funding to conduct the research? What are the advantages of overlooking poverty for those producing the evidence? By disregarding the role of poverty and income inequality, epidemic responses will remain insufficient, and may, instead worsen the situation of poor populations (Mykhalovskiy and Weir 2005) . Perhaps poverty remains unaddressed in epidemic responses as its origins in a neoliberalist society feel too deep to uproot.

Given that resources available for public health spending tend to be scarce, it is important that the risk of an epidemic is not distorted and that credible evidence on the effectiveness of the interventions is used to inform responses and justify spending. During the SARS outbreak, some of the published literature questioned the evidence on the efficacy of the proposed interventions, quarantine (Jacobs 2007) and travel advisories (Paquin 2007) . In Brazil, some evidence suggests that the spike in microcephaly cases is not a consequence of the Zika virus, but rather, the result of conditions of poverty, including poor sanitation and exposure to larvicides and insecticides (Diniz 2016) . This calls into question recommendations to delay pregnancy due to the Zika virus. As discussed above, the quality of response from global health organizations to the Ebola outbreak in Liberia remains debatable and questions the evidence used to inform and justify these responses.

Ironically, disease outbreaks facilitated the development of the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), an information sharing platform whose aim is to improve the credibility and authority of public health specialists to manage an outbreak. The platform is thought to have reduced the time between the outbreak and reporting and is thought to contribute to 40% of WHO's early warning and played a role in SARS notification, and subsequent outbreaks (Huff and Winnebah 2015) .

The review clearly showed the consistency in the scholarly literature, that it is common to find that complex issues are oversimplified, whereby culture is used to justify the assigning of blame to minority groups (Leach and Tadros 2014; Lupton 2016) . The review highlighted the role of politics and power in shaping different narratives, whereby powerful institutions assert particular narratives (often marginalizing the populations), which are Bpushedt o frame policies, publications, interventions, and funding agendas, while the narratives of the marginalized populations (those voiced by or representing marginalized people) are marginalized (Mykhalovskiy and Weir 2005) . This type of outbreak narrative was evident in the three epidemics discussed in this paper. In Toronto, SARS became a racialized disease, ultimately victimizing and excluding the Asian-Canadian community (Jacobs 2007; Ali 2008) . The spread of the Zika virus in Brazil is largely attributed to the consequences of globalization, including the widening habitat of the Aedes mosquito vector and increased human and air travel (Plourde and Bloch 2016; Gyawali et al. 2016; Fast et al. 2015; World Health Organization 2017e; Ordaz-Németh et al. 2017) . Cultural explanations are prominent in the outbreak narrative speaking to Ebola in Liberia, specifically the human consumption of bush meat and local/traditional burial practices that involve the touching and kissing of the deceased (Hagan et al. 2015; Kobayashi et al. 2015; Phua 2015 ; World Health Organization 2017c; Washington and Meltzer 2015; Ng 2008) .

When responsibility for the origin of the epidemic is reduced to cultural and ethnic minority groups, for example, the Asian community during the SARS epidemic, South American women living in poverty during the Zika epidemic, and communities engaging in traditional Liberian cultural practices during the Ebola epidemic, this further marginalizes the already vulnerable populations. It is important that emphasis is placed on the extreme vulnerability of these groups to an infectious disease outbreak, rather than placing blame and ultimately exacerbating experiences of oppression.

The findings in this paper should be interpreted with caution. First, this systematic review relied upon published peer-reviewed literature. This overlooked documents, such as WHO reports, government documents, and books, which might have contained relevant information. For example, we are aware of critical texts in the form of books, which may have enriched this manuscript-specifically, Ng (2008) and Teo, Yeoh, and Ong (2008) provide insight into how other cities affected by SARs attributed responsibility, talked about attribution of risk and responsibility for the disease; (Teo et al. 2008; Ali 2008) Teo, Yeoh, and Ong (2008) point to Singapore's attribution of responsibility and credibility of evidence; (Keil and Ali 2008) , while Keil and Ali (2008) also note the racialization of the SARS epidemic in Toronto, reflecting on the stigmatization of Toronto's Chinese and South Asian communities (King 2008) . However, King's (2008) work positions globalization as both responsible for causing and responding to infectious disease outbreaks (Ali et al. 2016) , such narratives are thought to create space to better understand how such processes might be repurposed as public health solutions. Finally, Ali, Dumbuya, Hynie, Idahosa, Keil, and Perkins (2016) ground the Ebola outbreak in Liberia in the context of colonial legacies, specifically emphasizing that global public health responses were political in that the establishment of the public health infrastructure tasked with responding to Ebola was influenced by social inequality, colonialism, and racism (). By adopting a social science perspective, Ali et al. (2016) unpack the diverse factorssocial, political, environmental, medical, and legal-that facilitated the escalation of the Ebola crisis (). However, since the scope of this paper was limited to peer-reviewed journal publications and one outbreak from each income context as an illustration, such information (from books and from other contexts) although relevant, was beyond the paper's scope.

Another limitation is the time frame of the study. Scholarly literature is consistently evolving, and in the specific case of the Zika epidemic, which was considered a public health emergency of international concern at the time of data collection, new and relevant research was being produced after data collection ended. For feasibility purposes, data collection ended in June 2017.

It is also important to note that research and research publications sometimes tends to be biased and may marginalize the narratives by or representing the most vulnerable poor populations and political topics. Furthermore, social science literature that did not fit the definition of politics as articulated for the purposes of this review was excluded. A future review might seek to unpack the themes that emerge from this additional literature.

This systematic review of the politics of three different outbreaks in three different social economic contexts revealed that the politics of epidemics are-to an extent-universal. However, the manner by which the politics are played out vary by the income setting, the political themes that speak to general epidemics were found to be uniquely enacted during the SARS outbreak in Toronto, the Zika outbreak in Brazil, and the Ebola outbreak in Liberia.

Perhaps the most universal finding of this systematic review is the role of social and economic inequality, including poverty during an epidemic. Regardless of the national income setting, minority and marginalized communities are the most devastated by an epidemic. If organizations and governments are to adequately respond to these individuals and communities, it is critical that narratives of those most vulnerable to an epidemic-specifically poor communities-are represented in the mainstream media as well as in the peer reviewed published literature-especially, the epidemiological and medical literature that tends to influence health programming and policy-making.

Asymptomatic Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus infection using a serologic survey in Korea

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a severe respiratory infection caused by a novel beta coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [1] [2] [3] . The symptoms of MERS include fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal symptoms, expectoration, wheezing, chest pain, hemoptysis, sore throat, headache, myalgia, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea; it can also cause death in severe cases [3] [4] [5] [6] .

The causative pathogen of MERS is transmitted via 4 modes: animal-to-human, intra-familial, healthcare-associated, and travel-related [7, 8] . The 186 cases that occurred in South Korea (hereafter Korea) were predominantly caused by healthcare-associated

The rates of asymptomatic infection with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus vary. A serologic study was conducted to determine the asymptomatic MERS infection rate in healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers by exposure status.

Study participants were selected from contacts of MERS patients based on a priority system in 4 regions strongly affected by the 2015 MERS outbreak. A sero-epidemiological survey was performed in 1,610 contacts (average duration from exposure to test, 4.8 months), and the collected sera were tested using an enzyme-linked immunespecific assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and plaque reduction neutralization antibody test (PRNT). Among the 1,610 contacts, there were 7 ELISA-positive cases, of which 1 exhibited positive IFA and PRNT results.

The asymptomatic infection rate was 0.060% (95% confidence interval, 0.002 to 0.346). The asymptomatic MERS case was a patient who had been hospitalized with patient zero on the same floor of the hospital at the same time. The case was quarantined at home for 2 weeks after discharge, and had underlying diseases, including hypertension, angina, and degenerative arthritis.

The asymptomatic infection was acquired via healthcare-associated transmission. Thus, it is necessary to extend serologic studies to include inpatient contacts who have no symptoms.

Only individuals who consented to participate in the study through a telephone call and gave written consent at the time of study initiation underwent surveys at local public health centers. Each participant responded to a questionnaire on exposure and provided a blood sample. Following the first serologic test by an enzymelinked immunospecific assay (ELISA), positive or borderline cases were tested using an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and a plaque reduction neutralization antibody test (PRNT).

MERS-CoV antibody levels in all sera collected from contacts were measured using a recombinant S1 protein-coated human anti-MERS-CoV (immunoglobulin G [IgG]) ELISA kit (Euroimmun, Luebeck, Germany), which was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. The results of the tested samples were determined by calculating the ratio of the optical density (OD) value of the sample to the OD value of the calibrator. Ratios ≥ 1.1 were considered positive, ratios ≥ 0.8 to < 1.1 were considered borderline, and ratios < 0.8 were considered negative.

IFA slides were coated with MERS-CoV non-infected or infected Vero cells. Serum samples were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to 1:10, 1:100, 1:250, and 1:1,000, transferred to IFA slides, and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C in a humidified chamber. The IFA slides were washed 3 times in PBS-T for 5 minutes transmission [7, [9] [10] [11] , followed by intra-familial transmission.

According to data reported to the World Health Organization, the rates of asymptomatic or mild infection were 44 of 398 (28.60%) in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Islamic Republic of Iran between April and June 2014, and 32 of 113 (28.31%) in Saudi Arabia in June 2014 [12, 13] . However, Oboho et al. [14] reported that 78.79% (26 of 33) of initially reported asymptomatic patients had at least 1 symptom. In Korea, among the 186 confirmed cases, 3 asymptomatic cases were detected among healthcare workers via screening tests (1.61%) [15] . In serologic studies using indirect immunofluorescence tests for healthcare workers who were at MERS-affected hospitals, 2 of 457 (0.44%) had positive results [16] . However, no report has been published regarding the asymptomatic infection rate among non-healthcare workers in Korea. There is a considerable chance of human-to-human transmission, as well as direct infection via the dromedary camel [17] [18] [19] . Therefore, it is necessary to identify the rate of asymptomatic MERS infections in healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers.

This survey was conducted between August 2015 and February 2016 after the last MERS case diagnosed in July 5, 2015. Based on a database of quarantined individuals provided by the Department of Epidemiologic Investigation of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), individuals from 4 regions with major outbreaks-Seoul, Gyeonggi, Chungcheong, and Jeonbuk -were selected. Individuals whose MERS status was diagnosed as positive using a polymerase chain reaction test were excluded from the analysis of this study. From the 14,831 quarantined individuals, 7,233 residents (48.8%) living in the 4 major MERS outbreak regions were selected. Of these individuals, calls requesting participation in this study were made to 3,291 individuals (45.5%) according to prioritization groupings. A total of 1,610 individuals (48.9%) ultimately participated in the study ( Figure 1 ). Those who refused to participate have been described in another study [20] .

The study individuals were prioritized in groups according to the transmission intensity of the MERS case they were exposed to, as follows: contact with super-spreading events (5 or more individuals infected) [21] , contact with spreaders who infected 1 to 4 individuals, and contact with non-spreaders. We selected study subjects according to this prioritization of groups, and the selection rates were 48.8, 16.4, and 15.8%, respectively. We also categorized the subjects according to their exposure intensity (i.e., status when they were exposed to the MERS case), as follows: inpatients or outpatients at a MERS-affected hospital, cohabiting family members or paid caregivers of the MERS case, visitors of the hospitalized MERS case, healthcare workers employed at a MERS-affected hospital, and colleague of the MERS case. We selected more subjects from the categories of family, patients, and visitors (Table 1 ).

Syndrome (MERS) serologic survey in Korea. 1 Major MERS outbreak areas including Seoul, Gyeonggi, Chungcheong, and Jeonbuk in Korea. 2 Selection rates were different by characteristics of exposed MERS case and status of subjects (see the Table 1 ). each and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-human IgG (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) diluted at 1:800 for 30 minutes at 37°C in a humidified chamber. After washing 3 times in PBS-T for 5 minutes, the slides were embedded with a mounting fluid, topped with a cover glass, and observed under a fluorescent microscope. The neutralizing antibodies in the serum samples were measured by PRNT. The PRNT procedures were performed as follows. In brief, 1:10 diluted sera were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes. Heat-inactivated sera were diluted serially 4-fold. After an equal volume of virus (MERS-CoV/KOR/KNIH/002_05_2015) was added to the volume of serum dilutions, these mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 2 hours. The mixtures were added to each well of the 24-well plate cultured with Vero cells. The plate was incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes, and 1 mL of 1.5% carboxymethylcellulose overlay medium was then added. After incubation for 3-4 days, cell staining was performed by crystal violet. The titer of neutralizing antibody by PRNT 50 was calculated using the Kärber formula, as described previously [22] . A titer above 1:20 was interpreted as positive. All sera with a positive or borderline reaction in ELISA were tested by the IFA and PRNT assays for confirmation, and cases with positive results from any 2 assays were con-sidered to be anti-MERS positive.

This study received approval from the bioethics committee of the KCDC (2015-08-EXP-03-P-A) and the institutional review board of the National Cancer Center (NCC 2016-0058). Informed consent was obtained from study participants or their parent or legal guardian for children under 14.

Among the 3,291 selected individuals, the response rates of contacts with super-spreading events (5 or more individuals infected), contacts with spreaders who infected 1-4 individuals, and contacts with non-spreaders were 39.8% (552 of 1,388), 40.3% (139 of 345), and 59.0% (919 of 1,558), respectively. According to their status when they were exposed to the MERS case, the highest response rates were found for healthcare workers (99.4%), and family members (97.1%), followed by visitors (75.8%), colleagues (49.0%), and patients (36.8%) ( Table 1) .

The seropositive rate using ELISA was 1.05% (6 of 574) in patients, 0.33% (1 of 307) in healthcare workers, and 0.43% (7 of 1,610) overall. Among the 7 ELISA-positive individuals, 3 had contact with a super-spreading event (patient zero, case #1) who Table 1 .

infected 28 individuals [23] , 1 had contact with a spreader (case #118) who infected 2 individuals, and 3 had contact with a nonspreader (case #89). Among the ELISA-positive individuals, only 1 was both IFA-positive and PRNT-positive. Therefore, the confirmed rates of asymptomatic MERS infection were 0.17% in patients and 0.060% (95% confidence interval, 0.002 to 0.346) overall ( Table 1) . The confirmed asymptomatic case, patient zero, and 11 secondary MERS patients were hospitalized on the same floor of the hospital at the same time [23, 24] . The asymptomatic case was quarantined at home for 2 weeks after discharge. The case had underlying diseases that included hypertension, angina, and degenerative arthritis. The case reported no fever, cough, myalgia, or gastrointestinal symptoms during hospitalization or quarantine (Table 2).

Limited information exists regarding MERS-CoV seroprevalence among populations other than confirmed MERS cases. Saudi Arabian data showed that the seroprevalence of MERS-CoV IgG among the general population was 0.15% [25] , suggesting that a number of cases of asymptomatic or mild infections may be present in the general population.

Despite a high prevalence of 186 confirmed MERS cases during the outbreak of MERS in Korea, the rate of asymptomatic infection (1.60%) [15] was lower than expected. The rates of asymptomatic infection confirmed using IFA and PRNT in the present study were 0.06% (1 of 1,610) for all contacts and 0.17% (1 of 574) for patients. These results are markedly lower than the rates of 0.27% (2 of 737) among healthcare workers, and 0.44% (2 of 457) among healthcare workers at MERS-affected hospitals in Korea [16] . Moreover, the rate of asymptomatic or mild infection in Sau-di Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Islamic Republic of Iran was approximately 28.00% [12, 13, 18] .

The confirmed asymptomatic case presented in this study was a patient at the same hospital as confirmed MERS cases and, unlike in previous studies, was neither an intra-familial infection nor a pediatric infection [26, 27] . The low rate of asymptomatic infection in Korea is attributable to the different transmission pathway of MERS infections compared to the Middle East. In Korea, most of the MERS cases were healthcare-associated infections, and none were from an animal. The low asymptomatic infection rate is also attributable to the extensive epidemiological investigation conducted in Korea, including close monitoring of contacts with MERS patients; this helped identify almost all MERS patients. This may also have been attributable to the promotion of proactive identification of patients via mass media and the establishment of communication networks by the government, leading to voluntary reports by people, active quarantine, and countermeasures to this public health crisis [10, 28, 29] .

ELISA is appropriate as a screening tool, as it is 10-fold more sensitive than IFA. However, it may cross-react with seasonal human coronavirus antibodies, so a spike protein-specific IFA is required for confirmation. PRNT is a definitive test when ELISA and IFA have inconclusive results [25] . Only 10% of ELISA-positive results are positive on a neutralization assay [25] . In our study, 1 of 7 patients with borderline or positive ELISA results also had positive results in PRNT. Therefore, the results obtained in our study are accurate because ELISA, IFA, and PRNT were used.

A previous study predicted the pandemic potential of MERS-CoV to be ≤ 5%; however, this does not indicate that the risk has abated [30] . Prerequisites for reducing the risk include improved surveillance, active contact tracing, and the initiation of animal host searching [30, 31] . During the outbreak in Korea, MERS was classified as a notifiable infectious disease and was subjected to surveillance [32] . Since MERS is an imported disease in Korea, it is recommended that precautions be taken before travel and that the time of returning from travel and incubation period be considered. This study showed a low seropositivity in the population of individuals quarantined due to contact with MERS cases. However, there is a possibility that the seropositivity rate was underestimated for the following reasons. Firstly, the participants of the present study were mostly non-healthcare workers and were relatively healthy. Thus, the risk of infection was low. Secondly, the overall participation rate was 48.9%, whereas it was 36.8% in the patient group at a higher risk of infection. Moreover, we only surveyed 10.9% of the quarantined individuals. Therefore, the actual rate of asymptomatic infections may be higher than reported in the present study. Lastly, the present study may have been conducted too late. In a previous study, MERS-CoV ELISA results indicated that the antibody response was highest after 3 weeks from symptom onset [33] . Although no reports have analyzed the duration of antibody presence in MERS patients regardless of symptoms, a recent study of severe acute respiratory syndrome and MERS reported that antibodies in some patients persisted for up to 2-3 years after infection [34, 35] . Blood sampling for serologic test in this study was performed on contacts between October and December 2015, while exposure to the confirmed case occurred between May and June 2015 (a gap of 5 months). Thus, a loss of the MERS-CoV antibody titer could have taken place despite actual asymptomatic infections; therefore, the actual rate of asymptomatic infection may be higher than the rate presented in this report.

In conclusion, among 1,610 contacts, only 1 non-healthcare worker who was a patient in a MERS-affected hospital had an asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection. To understand new emerging infectious diseases such as MERS, more intensive epidemiologic research is needed, including an analysis of asymptomatic infections.

EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE

The aim of this study was to analyze the changes in serum protein levels in the progression of hepatitis B using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) analysis, in addition to comparing the serum protein levels of patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), patients with hepatitis B virus-induced acute-on-chronic liver failure (HBV-induced ACLF) and normal individuals. Protein analysis was performed on 15 serum samples using iTRAQ. The study population included healthy controls (n=5), patients with CHB (n=5) and patients with HBV-induced ACLF (n=5). Western blotting was used to verify the results in an additional nine serum samples from healthy controls, patients with CHB and patients with HBV-induced ACLF (n=3, respectively). Using iTRAQ analysis, 16 different serum proteins with ≥1.5-fold differences in expression levels were identified in the patients with CHB and ACLF compared with the healthy controls. Five of those proteins, C-reactive protein precursor, hemoglobin β chain variant Hb S-Wake, apolipoprotein J precursor, platelet factor 4 precursor and vitronectin, which demonstrated the greatest differences in their expression levels and the most significant correlation with liver diseases, were subsequently verified using western blotting. The western blotting results were consistent with the results from the iTRAQ. Two of the five proteins are not classified by biological process, and the biological functions of all the proteins in HBV-induced ACLF remain unclear. This preliminary study demonstrated that a correlation between the expression of various serum proteins and the different pathogenetic conditions induced by HBV may exist. The analysis of a larger number of samples is required to identify potential protein biomarkers that may be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of hepatitis B.

In China, the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seropositive rate for the general population (between 1 and 59 years of age) is 7.18% (1) . Globally, there are ~93 million individuals with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections, 20 million of which are chronic (2) . Hepatitis B is the most common risk factor for liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the mortality of HBV-induced acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) may exceed 60%. HBV infections are not easy to cure, and the mechanisms of the virus are unclear, particularly with regard to protein expression and regulation function in the pathogenic process.

Proteomics analysis is a powerful technology used in a myriad of studies, including those focused on liver diseases (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ), as a quantitative method, is a common tool in proteomics and has been suggested to be as sensitive as (or more sensitive than) the differential in gel electrophoresis (DIGE) technique (8) . Specifically, the iTRAQ method has been used to study a variety of diseases and has been shown to be effective and accurate (4, 5, 9) .

The purpose of this study was to analyze serum protein levels using iTRAQ in normal controls, as well as patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and HBV-induced ACLF, and to verify those results using western blotting. The ultimate aim was to identify the differences in serum protein levels that were closely associated with the progression of hepatitis B and HBV-induced ACLF. The results of this study may provide crucial information regarding viral mechanisms and the pathogenic process.

Patients and specimens. Serum samples from healthy individuals and patients with CHB and HBV-induced ACLF were obtained from the Department of Infectious Diseases and the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China) (Tables I and II) . HBV-induced ACLF was diagnosed using the previously described criteria (10, 11 Sample preparation and protein extraction. Plasma was fractionated with ProteinMiner Protein Enrichment Small-Capacity kit, Cat# 163-3006, (ProteinMiner ; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein solutions were reduced for 1 h at 56˚C with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and were cysteine-blocked with 55 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) at room temperature for 10 min. Each sample was precipitated with four-times the volume of cold acetone. The total protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay.

Protein digestion and peptide tagging. Protein solutions [100 µg; 5 mg/ml in 0.5 M triethyl ammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) containing 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, pH 8.5]were digested for 24 h with 10 µg L-1-(4-tosylamido)-2-phenylethyl tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin. Each peptide solution was labeled for 3 h at room temperature using an iTRAQ reagent that had been reconstituted in 70 liters of ethanol, in accordance with the iTRAQ Reagents Multiplex kit instructions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The reaction was terminated by adding MilliQ water, and the samples were labeled with 114, 115, 116 and 117 mass-tagged iTRAQ reagents.

Strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX). SCX was performed to remove excess iTRAQ reagents and interfering substances for the mass analysis. The labeled peptides were then dried in a vacuum centrifuge and resuspended in 200 ml Buffer A, prior to being loaded on a Phenomenex Luna 55 µm SCX 100A column [250x4.60 mm (length x internal diameter), 5 µm; Phenomenex, Inc., Torrance, CA, USA] on an Agilent 1100 HPLC unit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Buffer A consisted of 10 mM KH 2 PO 4 and 25% acetonitrile at pH 3.0, while Buffer B consisted of 10 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 25% acetonitrile and 2 M KCl at pH 3.0. The 60 min gradient comprised 100% Buffer A for 30 min, 0-5% Buffer B for 1 min, 5-30% Buffer B for 15 min, 30-50% Buffer B for 5 min, 50% Buffer B for 4 min and 50-100% Buffer A for Table II . Clinical characteristics of the nine serum samples for western blotting verification. 5 min. Thirteen fractions were collected using a Foxy JR Fraction Collector (Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Fractions 2 and 3 were pooled according to the chromatogram profile, based on the peak intensity. All fractions were then dried in a vacuum concentrator and stored at -20˚C, prior to further analysis using mass spectrometry.

Peptides from the SCX fractions were dissolved in 0.3 µl 100% formic acid and diluted to 5 µl in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The peptides were loaded onto a micrOTOF-Q II-nano LC system (Bruker Daltonics, Inc., Billerica, MA, USA) and mass spectra were acquired in the 250-1,600 m/z range every second for 60 min.

Database screening. Data were processed using BioTools software (Bruker Daltonics, Inc.). The files were subsequently submitted to an in-house Mascot server (Matrix Science Ltd., London, UK) for database screening. The data were screened against the human sequence database [National Center for Biotechnology Information non-redundant (NCBInr)]. The search was performed using trypsin as a specific enzyme. A maximum of one missed cleavage was permitted and oxidation (M), iTRAQ 4 plex (K) and iTRAQ 4 plex (N-term) were selected as variable modifications. The data obtained on the micrOTOF-Q were searched with a peptide mass tolerance of 10 ppm and a fragment mass tolerance of 0.8 Da. Protein ratios were normalized using the overall median ratio for all the peptides in the sample for each separate ratio in every individual experiment. The ratio for a given protein was calculated by taking the average of all the peptide ratios that Briefly, the protein lysates were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane and subjected to immunoblotting with the following antibodies: Anti-apolipoprotein J precursor antibody (ab16077; dilution, 1:2,000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-hemoglobin β (sc-21757; dilution, 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA), anti-CRP precursor (ab32412; dilution, 1:1,000; Abcam), anti-platelet factor 4 precursor (AB1488P; dilution, 1:5,000; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and anti-VN (ab11591; dilution, 1:500; Abcam) at 4˚C overnight. After washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL; Forevergen, Guangzhou, China).

Tables I and II summarize the clinical characteristics of the patients from whom the samples were collected. iTRAQ identified 16 different proteins that had ≥1.5-fold differences in expression level between the patients with HBV-induced ACLF and CHB, respectively, and the healthy controls (Table III) .

Protein quantification software, based on the relative content of the isotopic reporter group and using m/z 114 as a reference, showed significant results (P≤0.05). Some identified protein was lost in the corresponding reporter group, giving no quantification information. The specific information and re-identification will be published in a future study. The 16 proteins that were identified using iTRAQ were classified into six categories, based on protein function (Fig. 1) . The five proteins that demonstrated the greatest differences in their expression and the most significant correlation with liver diseases were verified using western blotting: CRP precursor, hemoglobin β chain variant Hb S-Wake, apolipoprotein J precursor, platelet factor 4 precursor and VN ( Fig. 2 and Table IV) . Two of the five proteins were not classified according to biological processes (apolipoprotein J precursor and platelet factor 4 precursor). 

Proteomics research is a potentially useful and effective tool for studying pathogenesis, establishing prognosis and determining treatment outcomes in a variety of diseases. In the field of CHB, proteomics is not widely performed, presumably due to the mechanism of CHB being so complicated. The aim of this study was to describe the changes in serum protein levels in patients with CHB and HBV-induced ACLF, respectively, compared with healthy controls using iTRAQ and western blotting. The authors hypothesized that this approach had the potential to ultimately be beneficial for the identification of proteins that were important in the progression of HBV infections.

In the present study, 16 unique proteins were identified in patients with CHB and those with HBV-induced ACLF that had ≥1.5-fold differences in expression compared with those in the healthy controls. Those proteins belonged to six different categories based on protein function, while two out of the five proteins that were analyzed using western blotting were not classified according to biological processes (apolipoprotein J precursor and platelet factor 4 precursor). The biological functions of the remaining proteins in HBV infection and progression that were analyzed have not yet been elucidated; however, a number of theories are discussed in the following section.

CRP, synthesized in the liver, is an acute phase protein that is rapidly identified in the plasma in cases of infection or tissue damage. CRP is able to activate complement and enhance phagocytosis to facilitate the removal of pathogenic microorganisms and injured, necrotic and apoptotic cells. Therefore, CRP is important in natural immunity (12, 13) . Originally, CRP was considered to be a nonspecific biomarker of inflammation; however, following ~10 years of investigation, it has been demonstrated that CRP participates in inflammation and atherosclerosis directly and has been indicated to be a prognostic factor and a risk factor (14) . In this study, it was revealed that levels of the precursor of CRP were decreased in the patients with CHB and markedly increased in the patients with ACLF. Nearly identical changes were observed for the hemoglobin β chain variant Hb S-Wake, which has been implicated in in orphan diseases (15) , although not in liver diseases.

The apolipoprotein J precursor is important in cell aging and tumorigenesis with apolipoprotein J, lipid transfer inhibitor protein, complement C3d, corticosteroid-binding globulin and Table IV . Five serum proteins with the greatest differences in their expression levels and the most significant correlation with liver diseases, as verified using western blotting. apolipoprotein L1 (16, 17) . These latter five markers of fibrosis are secreted in the blood and show consistent changes with the increasing stage of fibrosis when compared with the markers used in the FibroTest and enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF), Hepascore and FIBROSpect tests. In the present study, the levels of apolipoprotein J precursor decreased in the progression of HBV from CHB to ACLF. Therefore, further studies, with a larger number of samples, are required in order to better establish the role of apolipoprotein J precursor as a potential biomarker for HBV progression.

Platelet factor 4 is chemotactic for numerous cell types. It also functions as an inhibitor of hematopoiesis, angiogenesis and T-cell function, which may be used as a biomarker for establishing a prognosis in severe acute respiratory syndrome (18) . Changes in platelet morphology, with accompanying increases in megathrombocyte fraction, may occur in chronic liver diseases, and thrombocytes are activated in chronic liver diseases and liver cirrhosis. Platelet sensitivity to stimuli in patients with liver cirrhosis has been demonstrated to be higher than in healthy controls (19) and it was indicated that platelet factor 4 was activated and upregulated in chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis. In the present study, levels of platelet factor 4 precursor decreased in the progression of hepatitis B to liver failure. This result suggests that further studies are required to investigate the potential of platelet factor 4 precursor as a biomarker in the progression of CHB.

VN is another protein that commonly features in studies on liver disease. It is a multifunctional plasma glycoprotein produced by hepatocytes that is detectable in plasma and the extracellular matrix. Glycosylation of VN modulates multimerization and collagen binding in liver regeneration (20) and alterations in VN glycosylation modulate substrate adhesion to rat hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which is responsible for matrix restructuring (21) . Immunoblotting data identified increases in VN levels in cirrhotic livers, and VN immunoreactivity has been shown to be markedly increased in the cirrhotic liver matrix, irrespective of the apparent reduction in plasma VN. VN immunoreactivity in the liver may be considered to be a marker of fibrosis, particularly for chronic/mature fibrosis, paralleling previous observations concerning the enhanced orcein staining of cirrhotic septa (22) . These results suggest that VN may be important in the progression of liver disease and/or in hepatic fibrosis through its collagen-binding domain I, and that VN levels are likely to be higher in patients with chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and liver cancer than in controls (20) (21) (22) (23) . In the present study, VN levels decreased in the progression of hepatitis B (from CHB to HBV-induced ACLF). The observation of decreased VN levels was consistent with two other studies (24, 25) . In one of these studies, it was demonstrated that, in chronic liver disease, the concentration of plasma VN was significantly lower than in healthy controls and was associated with the severity of liver disease. Notably, levels of VN in the liver tissue were significantly increased in patients with chronic liver disease compared with those in normal controls. These results suggested that VN was deposited in injured tissue during the repair process and functioned as an adhesive protein (24) . In the other study, it was demonstrated that there were lower levels of plasma VN in chronic liver disease, which was possibly due to a decreased synthesis, deposition in injured tissues or a combination of the two (25) . The same group of authors also revealed that decreased levels of plasma VN and fibronectin (FN) and increased levels of serum laminin (LM) P1 in patients with chronic liver diseases were associated with hepatic dysfunction, and that changes in the levels of the glycoproteins involved in cell attachment were significant in the development of hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic liver diseases (25) . Based on the accumulating information on VN and liver fibrosis, it appears that VN requires further study.

In the present study, the authors aimed to describe changes in serum protein levels in patients with liver dysfunction induced by hepatitis B and patients with severe liver damage (ACLF). The purpose of this was to specifically identify one or more proteins that are able serve as biomarkers for predicting a pathogenic condition and for prognostic purposes, similar to α-fetoprotein (AFP) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It was not possible in this study to obtain a series of serum samples from individual patients as they progressed through the various stages of hepatitis B infection to severe liver damage (ACLF). However, using iTRAQ and western blotting, several candidate proteins were identified (namely apolipoprotein J precursor, platelet factor 4 precursor and VN) that warrant further study using a larger number of samples.

Caring for Tuberculosis Patients: Understanding the Plight of Nurses at a Regional Hospital in Limpopo Province, South Africa

Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease which is caused by a relatively large, non-motile, rod-shaped pathogen called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB is a major cause of illness and death worldwide, especially in Asia and Africa. Despite the fact that TB is a curable illness, the tragedy is that TB remains the biggest killer in the world as a single pathogen. The aim of this study was to determine the experiences of nurses caring for TB patients at a regional hospital in Limpopo Province, South Africa. Qualitative, exploratory, and descriptive designs were used. A non-probability purposive sampling method was used to select the participants. The personal experiences of six nurses with more than five years' experience caring for TB patients at a regional hospital were explored, and it was guided by data saturation. Data were collected through in-depth individual interviews. Data were analyzed using Colaizzi's method. Trustworthiness was ensured and ethical considerations were observed in this study. The research findings revealed six major themes from the raw data: challenges of the working environment, problems impacting on the quality of nursing care, fear, anxiety, stress and risk of contracting infection, nurses' perceptions towards patients, support structure available in the hospital, and support needs for the nurses. Therefore, there is an urgent need to address the challenges experienced by nurses caring for communicable diseases through provision of a positive practice work environment.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of illness and death worldwide, especially in Asia and Africa. Despite the fact that TB is a curable illness, the tragedy is that TB poses a grave danger to healthcare workers including nurses because of their exposure to TB patients in health facilities. According to the World Health Organization [1] , TB remains the biggest killer in the world as a single pathogen, and the healthcare systems are being overwhelmed by the increasing number of TB cases.

It is estimated that one-third of the world's population is infected with TB which is responsible for 2-3 million deaths annually [1] . A study conducted by Valjee and van Dyk [2] in South Africa, reported that nurses caring for patients living with TB related illnesses, including HIV/AIDS expressed anxiety, helplessness, and vulnerability.

Nurses play a major role in caring for patients infected with different infectious diseases. Nurses in high TB burden settings are at higher risk of developing latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) when compared to the general population, due to their exposure to the large number of smear-positive TB cases managed at hospitals or healthcare facilities [3] . Working in a high-risk TB setting can lead to harrowing experiences for healthcare, especially where health facilities are poorly equipped and managed. Health Care Workers (HCWs), especially nurses, have higher rates of latent and active TB than the general population due to persistent occupational TB exposure, particularly in settings where there is a high prevalence of undiagnosed TB in healthcare facilities and TB infection control programmes are absent or poorly implemented [4] .

In the Limpopo Province of South Africa, TB is ranked the fourth among the major causes of death [5] . In 2009, the Limpopo Provincial TB Annual Report [6] stated that the number of TB cases in Vhembe district was 2194. In 2012, Vhembe district had the highest number of TB patients in the Limpopo Province [7] . Tshitangano et al. [8] , further indicated that TB infection control plans were not available at hospitals in Vhembe district and this contributed to the high number of TB patients. Infection control requires both human and material resources for maintenance and support [8] . In line with this assertion, Gursimrat [9] argues that one of the major challenges to control TB infection includes poor primary healthcare infrastructure. In addition, shortage of space and beds in the wards hinder separation of Multi-Drug Resistant TB (MDR-TB) and TB patients in healthcare facilities and these increases risk of contracting infection in the wards [10] . Healthcare-associated TB has become a major occupational hazard for healthcare workers. It was therefore imperative to explore and describe the experiences of nurses caring for tuberculosis patients at a regional hospital in Vhembe district, Limpopo Province.

The study used a qualitative, exploratory, and descriptive design to explore and describe the experiences of nurses caring for TB patients at regional hospital. The researcher wanted to uncover the personal experiences of nurses and the meanings that they attached to the events, processes, and structures of their lives in the TB wards. Therefore, an exploratory and descriptive design was the most suitable design.

This study was conducted at a regional hospital in Vhembe district in Limpopo Province, South Africa between 2014 and 2015. The hospital is a public healthcare facility situated in Thohoyandou, Limpopo province of South Africa. It is the only regional hospital in Vhembe district of Limpopo province with two TB wards and 20 beds. It is a referral hospital for seven community hospitals in Vhembe district. According to Wolmarans and Asia [11] , the total population is about 1,294,722, comprising of Vha-venda, Va-tsonga, and Sotho speaking people.

The study the target population comprised of all nursing staff in all TB wards caring for TB patients at a regional hospital in Vhembe District in Limpopo Province at the time of this study. The total population of nurses working in the TB ward was 22 nurses.

The study used a non-probability purposive sampling method, since it involves selection of individuals for participation based on their knowledge of a phenomenon that is being studied. It was believed that those participants would provide the researcher with the rich data needed to gain insight and discover new meaning in an area of study. The inclusion criteria were all nurses with five years' experience caring for TB patients since it was believed that they would provide information-rich data.

The estimated sample for the interview was 15 as they met inclusion criteria and 10 participants agreed and consented to participate, and data saturation was reached with six participants. Interviews were terminated when data saturation was reached, that was when information was repeated and when the researcher probed, rephrased questions, and requested clarity but the information kept repeating itself.

Data was collected through in-depth individual interviews. All participants who signed a written consent form before data collection were included in this study and were interviewed. The researcher explained the purpose of the study to each participant before interviewing them. Participants were assured that confidentiality will be maintained. The interview dates and times were arranged with participants prior to data collection date. Data collection took place between April-July 2015. The interviews were conducted early in the morning as suggested by participants before they could start with their duties to avoid distracting them from their normal ward routine work. Separate interviews with six participants took place in a private office within TB wards at the regional hospital, and each lasted approximately 30 min. All interviews were conducted by the researcher. All interviews started with an opening question: "What is your experience when nursing patients who suffer from TB?"

The research participants freely responded to open-ended questions in narrative form using their own words, thus sharing their own perspectives with the researcher. Questions were not planned in an inflexible manner. The questions were not asked in a pre-arranged sequence, but the researcher ensured that all relevant topics were covered and that the research focus was kept in mind. The researcher also asked probing questions to guide participants to elaborate further upon their responses where additional information were required or where unclear answers required more clarity. This resulted in gaining in-depth accounts about participants' experiences while caring for TB patients. Data was collected by means of audio-recordings, field notes, and in-depth interviews.

Data was stored in a password-protected computer. Access to the database was restricted to the researcher and supervisors only. Data was stored as per university's protocols. Any identifiable information that was collected remained confidential and was only accessible to the researcher and supervisors. Data was analyzed in groups not individually to avoid identifying the participants by their responses. Qualitative data analysis always takes place concurrently with data collection. Therefore, the researcher attempted to gather, manage, and interpret a growing bulk of data simultaneously. In this study, the audio-recorded interviews were transcribed and coded immediately after data collection. Data was analyzed using Colaizzi's [12] methods which comprise the following seven steps:

• Each research participant's verbatim transcript was read to acquire a sense of the whole. • Significant statements and phrases pertaining to the phenomenon being studied were extracted from each transcript.

Meanings were formulated from the significant statements.

Meanings were organized into themes, and themes evolved into theme clusters and eventually into theme categories.

These results were integrated into a rich and exhaustive description of the lived experience.

The essential structure of the phenomenon was uncovered.

Validation was sought from the research participants to compare the researcher's descriptive results with their lived experiences.

The proposal was submitted and presented to the School of Health Science and University Higher Degrees Committee (UHDC) and ethical clearance was granted (SHS/15/PH/07/1604). Permission to conduct the study was obtained from the Limpopo Provincial Department of Health and Vhembe District Department of Health, Nursing Service Manager, and Chief Executive Officer of the regional hospital. Consent forms were given to every participant to complete. The nature of research was described to the participants of the study and they were informed of their right to refuse to participate, or to withdraw from participating if they felt that they could not continue. The participants were also informed and assured that the information they provided would not be used against them or shared with other people but would be reported as findings of the study.

Anonymity was also ensured in which the participants did not write down their names or any personal identification. This allowed the participation to be anonymous. The researcher respected the choices and agreements made with the participants. The initial agreement was not changed without the knowledge of the participants. The participants were not victimized for refusing to participate in the study.

After data organization and analysis, six major themes were developed from the findings of this study and sub-themes were also formulated (see Table 1 ). Participants shared the same experiences with regards to caring for TB patients at Tshilidzini Hospital. 

Six major themes emerged after extensive data organization and analysis. These themes were developed from the comments that were made by the participants during data collection. A discussion of findings follows the presentation of each theme, as it is asserted that integrating the findings and the discussion is an appropriate method for encapsulating the essence of the phenomenon under investigation. Existing literature was searched and used to support the findings of this study.

Participants articulated that the hospital has a poor, aging infrastructure which is in dire need of refurbishment. TB wards were not structured to the standard that is suitable for TB wards and this does not induce the productivity of nurses in the wards. The following sub-themes were highlighted in the context of working environment, physical environment, and practice environment.

A good working environment can facilitate better service and reduce workload. A disorganized working environment impairs the health center teams. Infrastructure includes attention to space, ventilation, comfort, and rational layout that facilitates links within the healthcare settings. The workplace has an impact on preventing TB transmission; it serves as the first line of defense for preventing the spread of TB in the healthcare settings. Participants expressed similar sentiments about poor infrastructure.

Nurse (N1) said: "the hospital infrastructure is very old and deteriorating, the wards' layout is not conducive for TB wards, it has small windows that fuel bacterial concentration."

Another nurse (N2) added that: "the working environment is poor since we sit in the wards with patients all day long. During lunch time we sit in a small room within the TB wards, which accommodates less than five people and the door doesn't even close." Nurse (N4) said: "all patients are accommodated in the same wards, whether they are extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) or MRD or TB patients, hmmm the wards layout is not proper. We have to sit all day with patients and told that patients who are under treatment are not infectious (emotional)."

According to the findings of this study, physical environment was poor and TB ward designs were not conducive. A study that was done by Kieft et al. [13] indicated that improved hospital design can help reduce staff stress and fatigue and increase effectiveness in delivering care, improve patient safety, reduce patient and family stress, and improve outcomes and the overall healthcare quality. The findings of this study concur with the study that was done by Brophy [14] , which indicated that the nurses were concerned with their occupational environment and voiced concern about the deteriorating hospital infrastructure.

Positive practice environment is the setting that supports excellence and decent work. To ensure positive practice environment in the healthcare setting, it is important to consider health, safety, and personal well-being of the staff. These improve productivity and performance of the staff, it also benefits healthcare consumers, and leads to positive health indicators for the government.

Nurse (N3) said: "Sometimes we are supplied with fake N95 masks or required to use surgical masks. We only get 21 masks per week, to share with social workers, doctors and other staff that come to the TB wards. We do not get enough gloves, and we do not have aprons. We sometimes lack soap to wash our hands after coming into contact with TB patients, and we also have limited washing basins. In addition, the windows are too small and there is poor airflow in the wards. UV lights are not regularly service." Nurse (N1) added that: "This whole thing (emotional) of us being given fake masks results in negative practice for patient-care since we are afraid to contract TB. Each time we look at the patients we get scared of being in the same situation, hmmm, there are more negative thoughts in TB wards than positive ones."

The findings of this study revealed that there was a more negative practice environment in the TB wards than a positive one. According to the study that was done by Washeya [15] , it is important that the working environment enhances productivity. The findings of this study indicated that there was a poor practice environment in the TB wards. There was also an inadequate supply of personal protective materials. This leads to negative practice by the nurses, since they are afraid to contract diseases. The findings of the present study concur with those of a study that was done by Mametja [16] , which indicated that there was a more negative practice environment in HIV/AIDS wards which affected the quality of nursing care in the public hospital.

The main reason why patients should be admitted at the hospital is that they should be provided with quality care by healthcare professionals to recover well. However, there are challenges that impact quality of care. The following sub-themes will be discussed; adherence to treatment, delay in diagnosis, lack of equipment and working resources, and lack of enough skills and in-service training.

Patients default on treatment for different reasons, such as no longer feeling sick, lack of knowledge, personal or cultural beliefs, lack of access to healthcare facilities, lack of motivation, and poor relationship with healthcare workers. Non-adherence is one element that impacts negatively on the quality of nursing care. Below are the comments made by the participants.

Nurse (N4) indicated that: "The major problem that we have is that (emotional) our hospital is a rural-based and most patients are from the poor backgrounds; so, they always default their treatment for various reasons, such; continue to receive TB grant, bad side effects of medication, social problems and long distances to the clinics where they should collect their medications; lack of money to buy food since TB drugs make them eat more."

Nurse (N2) added that: "There is a high TB prevalence in surrounding rural areas. Some of them default because they go to traditional healers and the healers tell them that they have been bewitched; they are not really sick. When those patients come back to the hospital their condition will be bad and most of them do not survive a week. Some patients continue to smoke and drink alcohol and worsen their conditions as they fail to adhere to their treatment."

The findings of this study revealed that patients continued to default treatment for different reasons, such as experiencing side effects, alcohol abuse, cultural and religious beliefs, and lack of access to healthcare facilities. Some default because they wanted to continue receiving the TB grant. The findings of this study concur with those of a study that was done by Herrero et al. [17] , which listed the barriers contributing to poor TB treatment compliance, such as communication difficulties, low literacy level, inadequate knowledge and low awareness of TB disease, patients' attitudes and beliefs in treatment efficacy, depression and other psychiatric illness, alcohol and substance abuse, unstable living conditions, negative health provider attitudes, stigma and discrimination, overcrowding, and access to medicine.

Tuberculosis control can be effectively achieved if individuals with the disease receive adequate and timely treatment. Early diagnosis and prompt effective therapy form the key elements of the tuberculosis control programme. Delay in diagnosis results in increased infectivity in the community.

Nurse (N3) said: "Most of the patient are critically ill. Most of them report to the hospital when their conditions have deteriorated. They first go to traditional healers for help." Nurse (N1) indicated that: "Even when patients are diagnosed with TB they will still go to traditional healers for help because they do not believe they are ill; rather they believe that they have been bewitched. Some of them won't even disclose their status to their family members because of fear of being stigmatized. Many people in deep rural areas lack understanding."

According to the findings of the present study delays in diagnosis were due to the following factors: fear of stigma, patients' dissatisfaction with service from private healthcare providers, lack of knowledge, patients' beliefs, and patients choosing to consult traditional healers rather than healthcare facilities. The findings of this study concur with the study conducted by Mbuthia et al. [18] , many people in Africa visit traditional healers prior or concurrently with formal healthcare services. Delays in TB diagnosis is common in many regions worldwide, due to patient related factors, such as stigma, lack of information, dissatisfaction with TB service, inaccessibility of treatment, or provider-related factors such as diagnosis delay, knowledge and skills of healthcare workers, and inadequate infrastructure.

Improving the productivity and performance of health workers to ensure that health interventions are efficiently delivered is important in the healthcare setting. Human resources for health, consisting of clinical and non-clinical staff, are the most important assets of health systems. The performance of a health organization depends on the knowledge, skills, and motivation of individuals. It is important for employers to provide suitable working resources to ensure that the performances of employees meet the desired standards.

Nurse (N5) said: "we do not have essential equipment in the TB wards: UV lights, fans and air-conditioner are not working properly hmmm. I do not think they have ever been serviced since they were installed. Airflow in the wards is very poor because the wards are too small."

Another (Nurse 4) added: "There is a poor supply of N95 masks (sad) and it puts us in danger of contracting infection. But we are surviving by the grace of God. We are told that the hospital doesn't have enough money to buy masks."

According to the findings of this study, there is a shortage of equipment and working resources were impacting the quality of health in the TB wards. Participants appeared to be scared and were discouraged by the poor supply of resources in the wards. There was poor supply of N95 respiratory masks, UV lights were not regularly serviced, and there were no fans and air conditioners in the wards. The wards had small windows. There was also poor hygiene practice since there was a poor supply of detergents and hand washing soap. A study done by Mosadeghrad [19] concludes that inadequate or non-available facilities, equipment, and resources, especially basic resources to provide services such as water, steam, and electricity, hindered the provision of quality healthcare, proper conduct of tests, therapies, investigations, and surgery. Another study done by Reilly [20] , concluded that patients are almost twice as likely to die in some hospitals because they lack the proper equipment and resources.

Healthcare delivery can be highly labor-intensive and frustrating if the healthcare worker is not well trained. The quality, efficiency, and equity of services are dependent on the availability of skilled and competent health professionals. It is essential that health workers are appropriately trained to deliver the required services according to set standards.

Nurse (N5) indicated that: "our biggest challenge in the wards, is that we only have one nurse who is knowledgeable about TB. She is the only specialist in the wards; the rest of us know TB a bit because we read about it and from the experience that we have as nurses, even though some of us have attended workshops but I do not recall having to go for training. TB patients undergo different stages and it is important for us to understand them. Hmm some of the behaviors that we see in the wards shock us and we do not understand why patients could behave like they are insane."

A study by ten Hoeve et al. [21] , found that one of the independent functions of a nurse is education. According to a study that was done by WHO [1] , healthcare professionals need to seek up-to-date scientific knowledge from national, and international, academic and research institutions, including professional associations. The findings of this study revealed that there was a lack of skills and in-service training in the wards. This finding concurs with those of a study conducted by Yang et al. [22] , which indicated various barriers contributing to poor TB treatment, such as communication difficulties, low literacy level, inadequate knowledge, and low awareness of TB disease.

TB is a contagious disease and it is usually spread through the air by droplet nuclei. Transmission generally occurs indoors, in dark and poorly ventilated spaces. The following sub-themes will be discussed under fear, anxiety, stress, and risk of contracting infection: Exposure to risk, fear to contact patients, and patients spreading disease.

TB patients are likely to transmit the disease to the healthcare workers since TB is an airborne disease. This aspect of occupational risk is largely understudied, and preventive measures are frequently not in place. This problem is more in the low-to middle-income countries, due to increased prevalence of TB and lack of effective control programmes. Nurse (N6) said: "we are exposed to a great risk of being infected by TB, MDR-TB and XDR-TB because we do not have personal protective materials in place and hmmm the hospital also has poor infection control measures."

Another Nurse (N4) added: "the gloves that we get are not enough as well and we do not have aprons to cover ourselves. We put ourselves in a great danger of contracting infection, sometimes I get scared if I will not infect my family because the same clothes that I use at work is the ones that I go with at home and my children will come running when I am back from work I am scared to give them a hug because I do not know if my clothes are contaminated."

According to the findings of this study it was revealed that nurses feared contracting TB infection. Even though participants were provided with personal protective materials they were of poor quality. Participants seemed to be more concerned about their safety in the wards and they appeared to be more stressed and emotional about the danger that they are exposed to in the wards. A study done by Engelbrecht et al. [23] reveals that nurses consider themselves more vulnerable and at high risk of contracting infection.

TB is a major occupational hazard for Health care workers (HCWs) worldwide. The transmission of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurs through infected droplets aerosolized by patients with active pulmonary TB. The transmission risk to HCWs is highest when patients have unrecognized TB or are receiving inappropriate treatment. However, many other factors influence the risk of transmission and progression to active disease, including healthcare setting, occupational category, individual susceptibility/immune status, and the adequacy of TB infection control measures.

Nurse (N3) said that: "Most of the patients who are admitted in our wards are being transferred from other wards due to their critical conditions. When some wards such as medical wards realize that TB patients' condition has deteriorated, they transfer them to our wards, and by then you will find that they cannot do anything on their own. They need us to feed them, bath them and take them to the toilet." Nurse (N4) said: "Myself, I feel like I am putting myself in danger to be honest. I am scared to come into contact with those patients because most of them are rude and dangerous."

The findings of this study show that nurses were scared to come into contact with TB patients. As a result, they tend to spend less time with them. Nurses tend to neglect patients because of fear of getting infected and they provide less nursing care to those patients. According to the study done by Valjee and van Dyk [2] , healthcare workers express a sense of physical and mental exhaustion and stress from dealing with HIV/AIDS patients that need serious attention and care. The findings of this study concur with those of a study by Wyzgowski et al. [24] which showed that HIV/AIDS patients often tried to expose the nurses and their relatives to their blood and fluids on purpose.

TB patients can release tiny particles containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis into the air by coughing, sneezing, laughing, or singing. These particles are called air droplet nuclei. They are invisible to the naked eye. Droplet nuclei can remain airborne in room air for many hours, until they are removed by natural or mechanical ventilation. For TB to spread, there must be a person with TB disease who produces the TB bacilli, and another person who inhales the droplet nuclei containing the bacilli. Although TB is not usually spread by brief contact, anyone who is in close proximity with an infectious person is at risk of getting infected.

Nurse (N1) indicated that: "It is sad the way TB is spreading in our communities, we have a record of patients who come from one family or who are related. They decide to infect others or share their sputum just for them to get a TB grant. When they realize that they are recovering, they default for the social grant to continue. Most of those patients, when they come back to the hospitals, they will be MDR or XDR; they do not survive. Some MDR or XDR TB patients infect one another in the TB ward." Nurse (N6) had this to say: "Patients also spread disease when they use public transport. They go to church and when they are in shopping complex. Each time I hear of TB outbreak in the communities I get stressed because I see large number of people who are still going to die of TB. We feel vulnerable because in the whole community we are the first people in the line of danger."

According to the findings of the present study, TB patients spread TB in the wards and outside. The nurses indicated that they feel vulnerable, since they are at great risk of contracting TB. The nurses indicated that patients continue to spread infection, even when they are outside TB wards and that contributes to an outbreak of TB in rural areas. The findings of this study concur with those of the study done by Arjun [25] , which concluded that TB patients are a risk to community members because when they go to shopping centers and places where there are large numbers of people, such as social gatherings and church services they become a danger to the people.

Nurses provide nursing care to the patients during the period of their hospitalization. The way nurses perceive patients matters; the nurses play a major role in the patients' recovery. The following sub-themes will be discussed under nurses' perceptions of their work; feelings and nurses' emotions towards patients.

Nurses who care for dying patients are under pressure emotionally because of their beliefs and values about death as well as the emotions and reactions of the patients and their families. Despite TB being a curable disease, in almost all new cases, professionals such as psychologists, anthropologists, sociologists, and TB analysts have repeatedly indicated that talking about the disease still causes discomfort and unease in the population, especially within the poorer communities [26] . TB is surrounded by intense grief, with implications to different spheres of life, including social relationships. This is due to long-standing negative representations about this disease, which result in stigma and discrimination. Healthcare professionals believe besides TB's ability to impact patients' lives and causes death, it also has strong emotional impact on the life of a patient since it evokes disability, impotence, and self-discrimination.

Nurse (N6) reiterated that: "Most of our patients are very ill and their conditions are not good at all, you look at the person and see that chances are he/she might die, even though the hospital doesn't have enough resources for us to do our job, but (emotional) we can't just sit here and look we need to help those patients they become our responsibilities, we rather endanger our lives in order to save lives. I remember we have several cases where two patients from one family will be admitted and their beds will be next to each other, it always happens that one will die and the other one will remain, it will be so touching some even ask if he/she will be fine, to avoid frustrating the patient we always request that he/she be transferred to another hospital." Nurse (N3) indicated that: "Every time when I get to the wards I look at those kids some of them are very young and I just wish they would recover, they become so close to us like they are our own children or family members, we always encourage them to take medication and injections even when it is painful we help talk to them. Most of patients have side effects and they will vomit after taking medication and we always have to go all out and look for the food because they will be hungry."

According to the findings of this study, nurses experience stress, frustration, and pain due to the conditions of TB patients and they perceive their job as one of the hardest since it deals with emotions. Nurses always go to an extent of risking their lives in order to save lives. When they fail, they always feel bad and become emotionally frustrated. This study shows that, there is a high death rate in the TB wards of Tshilidzini Hospital, and when a patient dies, nurses feel sad and hurt. The findings of this study agree with those of the study by Khalid et al. [27] , which showed that participants also experienced a variety of emotions when nursing patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and not knowing what they were facing.

Due to the nature of work that nurses provide to the patients, it is important that they receive special support from their management and colleagues in order for them to offer quality service. The following sub-themes will be discussed under support system available in the hospital; support from the managers, support from the psychologist and appreciation of staff.

Nursing managers are widely accepted as the most influential force in staff satisfaction and retention because of their role in work environments. Hospital management protects and provides staff with the resources to do their job. Within the clinical settings, managers are consistent in their presence; uniquely positioned with a front-row view of the intricacies of nurse-patient, nurse-physician, and nurse-interdisciplinary team dynamics. Hospitals, together with nursing managers, are expected to oversee the daily demands of unit operations while developing an environment that fosters nursing excellence and promotes an engaged nursing staff. On the other hand, nursing managers are the vital link between hospital senior executives and direct care nurses. Good management makes a hospital meet its complex target. Below are the comments made by the participants:

Nurse (N5) commented positively saying that: "we do receive full support that we need in the wards from the managers. But we are happy of the fact that the hospital CEO does support us, and the nursing service manager gives us support."

Nurse (N6) also commented that: "Hmmm we believe that for now we just need a special support from the management and all TB programme leaders, to give us more knowledge and skills on TB." Nurse (N3) indicated that: "I believe that as a nurse it is more crucial that we have meetings with the doctors and other management staff."

According to the findings of the present study even though the support structure from the management is available, there is a need for special support for TB patients. Lack of support from the management confuses the nursing staff and causes staff to lose interest in their job. The findings of this study concur with those of the study by Manyisa and van Aswegen [28] , which revealed that South African hospitals' working environments lack resources and managerial support.

Nursing has long been considered as one of the most stressful professions. Stress in nursing is attributed largely to the physical labor, suffering, and emotional demands of patients and families; long working hours, shift work, and interpersonal relationships. Sophisticated healthcare technologies, budget cuts, increasing workload, and constant organizational changes in some healthcare environments appear to be the factors that have increased stress among nurses. Nurses seem to be overexposed to a range of psychosocial stressors. As a result, it is important that they receive psychological support regularly in order for them to cope in their working environment and remain productive. Below are the comments made by the participants:

Nurse (N2) indicated that: "The most painful and traumatizing thing in the TB wards is that patients die in large numbers and it is so stressing to see people dying just before you every day. We really need clinical psychologists to come and render counselling, but all they do is to schedule an appointment with us and never come to talk to us. We do not get even debriefing sessions. As a result, we feel that we are losing it, at times we just can't cope."

The findings of this study revealed that nurses do not receive personal psychological support. Even though the support structure is there in the hospital, their needs are not considered and attended to. A study by Mametja [16] reported concerns that were raised by nurses, that they needed counselling, not only when they have contracted the disease, but for them to cope with the demands of the high number of patients who no longer recover from the illness, but die as the result of HIV/AIDS. The findings of the present study agree with those of the study by Arjun [25] , which concluded that nurses caring for MDR-TB patients did not receive psychological support from the clinical psychologists when they need it; neither was there a functional employee assistance programme available at the institution.

Hospitalized patients require more than a dozen daily medications that are administered at various hours and in multiple ways. Although physicians have the responsibilities to diagnose infections and prescribe medications for patients, nurses are responsible for actively caring, feeding, bathing, and dispensing medication for hospitalized patients throughout the day. Nurses are on the front line of fighting all kinds of diseases in the world, and they risk their lives to provide quality healthcare services in the hospital.

Nurse (N2) showed concern and said: "the hospital doesn't even appreciate us for the good work that we are doing by risking our lives daily. We do not even get a danger allowance in case we contract infection in the wards. Instead we are being told that if we are found with TB we would be moved to another ward which is not a TB ward." Nurse (N1) further indicated that: "we do not have TB awareness campaign, even just for a day, where the management just appreciates us for the great work that we are doing. At times I even consider other opportunities. Even the families of patients blame us for everything that goes wrong with the patients they do not appreciate the effort we put to care for the patients."

According to the findings of the present study TB nurses feel unappreciated for what they are doing. TB nurses are on the frontline of the fight against the highly infectious diseases that affect many people. In spite of this, they do not receive a danger allowance and the hospital does not celebrate TB day as a way of appreciating TB nurses as pioneers in the hospitals who risk their lives in order to fight TB disease. In support of these findings, Loghmani et al. [29] reported that the participants' experiences were that the families believed that nurses did not do their best for the patients and that they abused the patients. The findings of this study concur with those of the study by Sodeify et al. [30] , which concluded that South African nurses were not well supported, appreciated, recognized, and well-rewarded; unlike in other countries since they provide quality service to patients under very difficult circumstances with limited resources. This is why they leave South Africa to work in other countries.

Evidence indicates that nurses have a heavy workload and they work under pressure on a daily basis. They are expected to have high levels of independence, well-developed problem-solving abilities, and leadership responsibilities. Regardless of all the skills they have acquired they still express needs that are not met by the healthcare managements. The following sub-themes were developed under support needs for the nurses: good ventilated working environment, good infection control and prevention measurements, and special support from management.

TB is transmitted through airborne routes. Poorly designed or overcrowded healthcare facilities play an important role in TB transmission and also increases the chances of cross-infection between patients and healthcare workers. HCWs are essential in the fight against TB infection and they should be protected. A good ventilated working environment should have natural, mechanical, and negative pressure ventilation to reduce the risk of spreading TB infection in the wards. Natural ventilation relies on open doors and windows to bring fresh air in the wards from outside, which dilutes the concentration of particles such as droplet nuclei containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Nurse (N6) said: "the building where TB wards are allocated is old and needs refurbishment. The infrastructure is very old and not user friendly for implementing principles of infection control.

Our biggest concern is that the TB wards are perpetuating the spread of infection. The management promised us that they will build new TB wards that are well ventilated, that have good airflow, fans and regularly serviced UV lights as well as big windows and patients' waiting area to allow airflow. The wards will have nursing station and there will be a demarcation between TB, MDR-TB and XDR-TB. We really need those wards because we are not safe here."

The findings of this study revealed that nurses need well-ventilated TB wards in the hospital. The TB wards layout was not suitable and lacked ventilation, which increased risk of TB spread. The working environment was not safe and did not meet the national standards guidelines for a TB ward setting, as recommended by South Africa [31] . According to the study by Narasimhan et al. [32] , overcrowding and poorly ventilated environments increase the risk of acquiring TB.

Good infection control and prevention in the healthcare settings reduce the risk of contracting TB infection. TB settings should have the following TB infection control and prevention measures: workplace and administrative control measures, environmental control measures, and personal control measures. People who work or receive care in healthcare settings are at higher risk of being infected by TB. Therefore, it is necessary to have a TB infection control plan. Healthcare facilities should design policies and procedures for TB control. It should be reviewed periodically and evaluated for effectiveness to determine the actions necessary to minimize the risk for transmission of TB.

Nurse (N3) indicated that: "We have an urgent need for good quality equipment and personal measures such as N95 respiratory masks, gloves and protective clothes like those in theatres, to protect us from contracting infection with our clothes and expose our families to risks of contracting infection."

Nurse (N4) said: "We need infection control and prevention to be in place for our safety. It is important that after having contact with patients we should wash our hands with soap. The Provincial government people always say never risk going into TB wards without protective materials."

The findings of this study revealed that infection control and prevention are not available in TB wards. The nurses expressed a need for those. Nurses and patients were at a great risk of contracting TB infection in the wards. The findings of this study agree with those study by Tshitangano et al. [8] , which concluded that infection control plans are not available at the hospitals in Vhembe District, and this results in a high risk of TB infection transmission in the hospitals.

Nurses play a vital role in the hospital of caring for patients. They are the core members of the hospital who produce good and quality results. Therefore, it is important for the hospital CEO and nursing unit managers to support them in order for them to remain productive. The hospitals should make sure that they order quality equipment, and other materials to assist nurses to do their work effectively. Nurses should be provided with adequate and necessary training to empower them with relevant skills and knowledge. Good management empowers employees in the hospital in different ways and also listens to their requests. Below are the comments made by the participants: Nurse (N5) said: "Hmmm, we believe that for now we just need special support from the management and all TB programme managers, to empower us with knowledge maybe by having workshops with us or arranging in-service training. It is crucial that we gain more knowledge on how to communicate with patients who are showing side effects or who are likely to default when they are at home. I believe that if we can be empowered with knowledge, the death rate and the spread of disease can be reduced."

Nurse (N1) said: "I believe that it is important to have meetings with doctors and other management to give us in-service training and workshop."

According to the findings of this study nurses have various unmet needs when they are doing their job. Participants expressed the need for special support from the management. They were in need of adequate supplies of specialized protective N95 masks, in-service training, workshops, proper equipment, and a daily diet for TB nurses. A study by Sodeify et al. [30] revealed that poor working conditions, lack of resources, special managerial support from the hospitals in South Africa were the reasons why nurses left South Africa to go and work abroad.

The study focused on the experience of nurses caring for TB patients at Tshilidzini Hospital in Limpopo Province, South Africa and therefore the findings cannot be generalized. However, according to Smith [33] , generalizability in a qualitative study is not intended. The hospital where the study was conducted is situated in the rural area. Therefore, if other hospitals had been included, it could have led to different data findings.

Based on the above findings, the following recommendations were made:

•

Managers should ensure that TB wards are conducive and adhere to stipulated standards of preventing the spread of infection.

Nurses should be provided with necessary equipment and material resources required to provide care to patients in the TB wards.

They must implement infection control policies in the wards and health and safety measures must be in place.

They must ensure procurement of good quality personal protective materials such as N95 respiratory masks, gloves, and aprons and also follow their usage protocol.

Health education should be given to TB patients and their relatives for them to prevent the spread of infection and maintain good hygienic practices.

Managers must ensure that they provide their staff with regular in-service training and workshops to equip them with up-to-date information on TB care and infection control practices.

Management should provide nurses with debriefing and counselling.

Managements should appreciate TB nurses and acknowledge their services through accolades and incentives to boost their morale. • TB nurses should be screened for free as stipulated in the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Act to monitor their health status

The study highlighted the plight of nurses when caring for patients suffering from tuberculosis. Nurses indicated their emotional distress due to fear of contagion, lack of material resources, as well as poor infection control practices. The Occupational Health and Safety Act stipulates measures and standards of practice, however such standards are jeopardized by inadequate financial and resource allocation in the public sector. Nurses expressed the need for in-service education and support by managers. Managers must ensure that nurses have resources to maintain quality nursing care and receive social and psychological support as they face death on a daily basis. While available resources are limited, there is a need to direct resources to the problem, to improve quality of services in the TB wards.

Far-UVC light: A new tool to control the spread of airborne-mediated microbial diseases

Airborne-mediated microbial diseases such as influenza and tuberculosis represent major public health challenges. A direct approach to prevent airborne transmission is inactivation of airborne pathogens, and the airborne antimicrobial potential of UVC ultraviolet light has long been established; however, its widespread use in public settings is limited because conventional UVC light sources are both carcinogenic and cataractogenic. By contrast, we have previously shown that far-UVC light (207-222 nm) efficiently inactivates bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin. This is because, due to its strong absorbance in biological materials, far-UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer (non living) layers of human skin or eye; however, because bacteria and viruses are of micrometer or smaller dimensions, far-UVC can penetrate and inactivate them. We show for the first time that far-UVC efficiently inactivates airborne aerosolized viruses, with a very low dose of 2 mJ/cm 2 of 222-nm light inactivating >95% of aerosolized H1N1 influenza virus. Continuous very low dose-rate far-UVC light in indoor public locations is a promising, safe and inexpensive tool to reduce the spread of airbornemediated microbial diseases.

Airborne-mediated microbial diseases represent one of the major challenges to worldwide public health 1 . Common examples are influenza 2 , appearing in seasonal 3 and pandemic 4 forms, and bacterially-based airborne-mediated diseases such as tuberculosis 5 , increasingly emerging in multi-drug resistant form.

A direct approach to prevent the transmission of airborne-mediated disease is inactivation of the corresponding airborne pathogens, and in fact the airborne antimicrobial efficacy of ultraviolet (UV) light has long been established 6-8 . Germicidal UV light can also efficiently inactivate both drug-sensitive and multi-drug-resistant bacteria 9 , as well as differing strains of viruses 10 . However, the widespread use of germicidal ultraviolet light in public settings has been very limited because conventional UVC light sources are a human health hazard, being both carcinogenic and cataractogenic 11,12 .

By contrast, we have earlier shown that far-UVC light generated by filtered excimer lamps emitting in the 207 to 222 nm wavelength range, efficiently inactivates drug-resistant bacteria, without apparent harm to exposed mammalian skin [13] [14] [15] . The biophysical reason is that, due to its strong absorbance in biological materials, far-UVC light does not have sufficient range to penetrate through even the outer layer (stratum corneum) on the surface of human skin, nor the outer tear layer on the outer surface of the eye, neither of which contain living cells; however, because bacteria and viruses are typically of micron or smaller dimensions, far-UVC light can still efficiently traverse and inactivate them [13] [14] [15] .

The earlier studies on the germicidal efficacy of far UVC light 13,15-18 were performed exposing bacteria irradiated on a surface or in suspension. In that a major pathway for the spread of influenza A is aerosol transmission 3 , we investigate for the first time the efficacy of far-UVC 222-nm light for inactivating airborne viruses carried by aerosols -with the goal of providing a potentially safe alternative to conventional 254-nm germicidal lamps to inactivate airborne microbes.

Virus inactivation. Figure 1 shows representative fluorescent 40× images of mammalian epithelial cells incubated with airborne viruses that had been exposed in aerosolized form to far-UVC doses (0, 0.8, 1.3 or 2.0 mJ/cm 2 ) generated by filtered 222-nm excimer lamps. Blue fluorescence was used to identify the total number of

cells in a particular field of view, while green fluorescence indicated the integration of live influenza A (H1N1) viruses into the cells. Results from the zero-dose control studies (Fig. 1, top left) confirmed that the aerosol irradiation chamber efficiently transmitted the aerosolized viruses through the system, after which the live virus efficiently infected the test mammalian epithelial cells. Figure 2 shows the surviving fraction, as a function of the incident 222-nm far-UVC dose, of exposed H1N1 aerosolized viruses, as measured by the number of focus forming units in incubated epithelial cells relative to unexposed controls. Linear regressions (see below) showed that the survival results were consistent with a classical exponential UV disinfection model with rate constant k = 1.8 cm 2 /mJ (95% confidence intervals 1.5-2.1 cm 2 / mJ). The overall model fit was good, with a coefficient of determination, R 2 = 0.95, which suggests that most of the variability in virus survival was explained by the exponential model. The rate constant of 1.8 cm 2 /mJ corresponds to an inactivation cross-section (dose required to inactivate 95% of the exposed viruses) of D 95 = 1.6 mJ/cm 2 (95% confidence intervals 1.4-1.9 mJ/cm 2 ).

We have developed an approach to UV-based sterilization using single-wavelength far-UVC light generated by filtered excilamps, which selectively inactivate microorganisms, but does not produce biological damage to exposed mammalian cells and tissues [13] [14] [15] . The approach is based on biophysical principles in that far-UVC light can traverse and therefore inactivate bacteria and viruses which are typically micrometer dimensions or smaller, whereas due to its strong absorbance in biological materials, far-UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer dead-cell layers of human skin, nor the outer tear layer on the surface of the eye.

Here we applied this approach to test the efficacy of the 222-nm far-UVC light to inactivate influenza A virus (H1N1) carried by aerosols in a benchtop aerosol UV irradiation chamber, which generated aerosol droplets of sizes similar to those generated by human coughing and breathing. Aerosolized viruses flowing through the irradiation chamber were exposed to UVC emitting lamps placed in front of the chamber window.

As shown in Fig. 2 , inactivation of influenza A virus (H1N1) by 222-nm far-UVC light follows a typical exponential disinfection model, with an inactivation cross-section of D 95 = 1.6 mJ/cm 2 (95% CI: 1.4-1.9). For comparison, using a similar experimental arrangement, but using a conventional 254 nm germicidal UVC lamp, McDevitt et al. 19 found a D 95 value of 1.1 mJ/cm 2 (95% CI: 1.0-1.2) for H1N1 virus. Thus as we 13, 15 and others [16] [17] [18] reported in earlier studies for bacterial inactivation, 222-nm far-UVC light and 254-nm broad-spectrum germicidal light are also comparable in their efficiencies for aerosolized viral inactivation. Other recent work comparing viral inactivation across the UVC spectrum has shown variations in efficiency are expected, but in general both regions of the spectrum are effective in inactivation, though the precise cause of inactivation may differ 20, 21 . However as discussed above, based on biophysical considerations and in contrast to the known human health safety issues associated with conventional germicidal 254-nm broad-spectrum UVC light, far-UVC light does not appear to be cytotoxic to exposed human cells and tissues in vitro or in vivo [13] [14] [15] .

If these results are confirmed in other scenarios, it follows that the use of overhead low-level far-UVC light in public locations may represent a safe and efficient methodology for limiting the transmission and spread of airborne-mediated microbial diseases such as influenza and tuberculosis. In fact the potential use of ultraviolet light for airborne disinfection is by no means new, and was first demonstrated more than 80 years ago 8, 22 . As applied more recently, airborne ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) utilizes conventional germicidal UVC light in the upper part of the room, with louvers to prevent direct exposure of potentially occupied room areas 23 . This results in blocking more than 95% of the UV radiation exiting the UVGI fixture, with substantial decrease in effectiveness 24 . By contrast, use of low-level far-UVC fixtures, which are potentially safe for human exposure, could provide the desired antimicrobial benefits without the accompanying human health concerns of conventional germicidal lamp UVGI.

A key advantage of the UVC based approach, which is in clear contrast to vaccination approaches, is that UVC light is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes. For example, while there will almost certainly be variations in UVC inactivation efficiency as different influenza strains appear, they are unlikely to be large 7, 10 . Likewise, as multi-drug-resistant variants of bacteria emerge, their UVC inactivation efficiencies are also unlikely to change greatly 9 .

In conclusion, we have shown for the first time that very low doses of far-UVC light efficiently inactivate airborne viruses carried by aerosols. For example, a very low dose of 2 mJ/cm 2 of 222-nm light inactivates >95% of airborne H1N1 virus. Our results indicate that far-UVC light is a powerful and inexpensive approach for prevention and reduction of airborne viral infections without the human health hazards inherent with conventional germicidal UVC lamps. If these results are confirmed in other scenarios, it follows that the use of overhead very low level far-UVC light in public locations may represent a safe and efficient methodology for limiting the transmission and spread of airborne-mediated microbial diseases. Public locations such as hospitals, doctors' offices, schools, airports and airplanes might be considered here. This approach may help limit seasonal influenza epidemics, transmission of tuberculosis, as well as major pandemics.

Far-UVC lamps. We used a bank of three excimer lamps containing a Kr-Cl gas mixture that predominantly emits at 222 nm 25, 26 . The exit window of each lamp was covered with a custom bandpass filter designed to remove all but the dominant emission wavelength as previously described 15 . Each bandpass filter (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT) had a center wavelength of 222 nm and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 25 nm and enables >20% transmission at 222 nm. A UV spectrometer (SPM-002-BT64, Photon Control, BC, Canada) with a sensitivity range between 190 nm and 400 nm was utilized to verify the 222 nm emission spectrum. A deuterium lamp standard with a NIST-traceable spectral irradiance (Newport Model 63945, Irvine, CA) was used to radiometrically calibrate the UV spectrometer. An SM-70 Ozone Monitor (Aeroqual, Avondale, Auckland, New Zealand) measured the ozone generation from the lamps to be <0.005 ppm, which is not a significant level to provide an antimicrobial effect to aerosolized viruses 27 .

Far-UVC dosimetry. Optical power measurements were performed using an 818-UV/DB low-power UV enhanced silicon photodetector with an 843-R optical power meter (Newport, Irvine, CA). Additional dosimetry to determine the uniformity of the UV exposure was performed using far-UVC sensitive film as described in our previous work 28, 29 . This film has a high spatial resolution with the ability to resolve features to at least 25 µm, and exhibits a nearly ideal cosine response 30, 31 . Measurements were taken between experiments therefore allowing placement of sensors inside the chamber.

Scientific RePoRtS | (2018) 8:2752 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-21058-w A range of far-UVC exposures, from 3.6 µJ/cm 2 up to 281.6 mJ/cm 2 , were used to define a response calibration curve. Films were scanned as 48 bit RGB TIFF images at 150 dpi using an Epson Perfection V700 Photo flatbed scanner (Epson, Japan) and analyzed with radiochromic film analysis software 32 to calculate the total exposure based on measured changes in optical density.

Measurements using both a silicon detector and UV sensitive films were combined to compute the total dose received by a particle traversing the exposure window. The three vertically stacked lamps produced a nearly uniform dose distribution along the vertical axis thus every particle passing horizontally through the irradiation chamber received an identical dose. The lamp width (100 mm) was smaller than the width of the irradiation chamber window (260 mm) so the lamp power was higher near the center of the irradiation chamber window compared to the edge. The UV sensitive film indicated a power of approximately 120 µW/cm 2 in the center third of the window and 70 µW/cm 2 for the outer thirds. The silicon detector was used to quantify the reflectivity of the aluminum sheet at approximately 15% of the incident power. Combining this data allowed the calculation of the average total dose of 2.0 mJ/cm 2 to a particle traversing the window in 20 seconds. Additionally, the silicon detector was used to confirm the attenuation of 222-nm light through a single sheet of plastic film was 65%. The addition of one or two sheets of plastic film between the lamps and the irradiation chamber window yielded average doses of 1.3 mJ/cm 2 and 0.8 mJ/cm 2 , respectively.

Benchtop aerosol irradiation chamber. A one-pass, dynamic aerosol / virus irradiation chamber was constructed in a similar configuration to that used by Ko et al. 33 , Lai et al. 34 , and McDevitt et al. 19, 35 . A schematic overview of the system is shown in Fig. 3 and is pictured in Fig. 4 . Aerosolized viruses were generated by adding a virus solution into a high-output extended aerosol respiratory therapy (HEART) nebulizer (Westmed, Tucson, AZ) and operated using a dual-head pump (Thermo Fisher 420-2901-00FK, Waltham, MA) with an input flow rate of 11 L/min. The aerosolized virus flowed into the irradiation chamber where it was mixed with independently controlled inputs of humidified and dried air. Humidified air was produced by bubbling air through water, while dry air was provided by passing air through a desiccant air dryer (X06-02-00, Wilkerson Corp, Richland, MI). Adjusting the ratio of humid and dry air enabled control of the relative humidity (RH) within the irradiation chamber which, along with the nebulizer settings, determined the aerosol particle size distribution. An optimal RH value of 55% resulted in a distribution of aerosol particle sizes similar to the natural distribution from human coughing and breathing, which has been shown to be distributed around approximately 1 µm, with a significant tail of particles less than 1 µm 36-38 .

After combining the humidity control inputs with the aerosolized virus, input flow was directed through a series of baffles that promoted droplet drying and mixing to produce an even particle distribution and stable humidity 34 . The RH and temperature inside the irradiation chamber were monitored using an Omega RH32 meter (Omega Engineering Inc., Stamford, CT) immediately following the baffles. A Hal Technologies HAL-HPC300 particle sizer (Fontana, CA) was adjoined to the irradiation chamber to allow for sampling of particle sizes throughout operation.

During UV exposure, the 222-nm lamps were placed 11 cm from the irradiation chamber window. The lamps were directed at the 26 cm × 25.6 cm chamber window which was constructed of 254-µm thick UV transparent plastic film (Topas 8007x10, Topas Advanced Polymers, Florence, KY), and which had a transmission of ~65% at 222 nm. The wall of the irradiation chamber opposite the transparent window was constructed with polished aluminum in order to reflect a portion of the UVC light back through the exposure region, therefore increasing the overall exposure dose by having photons pass in both directions. The depth of the irradiation chamber between the window and the aluminum panel was 6.3 cm, creating a total exposure volume of 4.2 L. Flow of the aerosols continues out of the irradiation chamber to a set of three way valves that could be configured to either pass through a bypass channel (used when no sampling was required), or a BioSampler (SKC Inc, Eighty Four, PA) used to collect the virus. The BioSampler uses sonic flow impingement upon a liquid surface to collect aerosols when operated at an air flow of 12.5 L/min. Finally, flow continued out of the system through a final HEPA filter and to a vacuum pump (WP6111560, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). The vacuum pump at the end of the system powered flow through the irradiation chamber. The flow rate through the system was governed by the BioSampler. Given the flow rate and the total exposure volume of the irradiation chamber, 4.2 L, a single aerosol droplet passed through the exposure volume in approximately 20 seconds.

The entire irradiation chamber was set up inside a certified class II type A2 biosafety cabinet (Labconco, Kansas City, MO). All air inputs and outputs were equipped with HEPA filters (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) to prevent unwanted contamination from entering the chamber as well as to block any of the virus from releasing into the environment.

Irradiation chamber performance. The custom irradiation chamber simulated the transmission of aerosolized viruses produced via human coughing and breathing. The chamber operated at a relative humidity of 55% which resulted in a particle size distribution of 87% between 0.3 µm and 0.5 µm, 11% between 0.5 µm and 0.7 µm, and 2% > 0.7 µm. A comparison to published ranges of particle size distributions is shown in Table 1 . Aerosolized viruses were efficiently transmitted through the system as evidenced from the control (zero exposure) showing clear virus integration (Fig. 1, top left) . , (1) where k is the UV inactivation rate constant or susceptibility factor (cm 2 /mJ). The regression was performed with the intercept term set to zero, which represents the definition of 100% relative survival at zero UV dose. Bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for the parameter k were calculated using R 3.2.3 software 41 . The virus inactivation cross section, D 95 , which is the UV dose that inactivates 95% of the exposed virus, was calculated as D 95 = −ln[1 − 0.95]/k.

BMC Public Health Public perceptions of quarantine: community-based telephone survey following an infectious disease outbreak

The use of restrictive measures such as quarantine draws into sharp relief the dynamic interplay between the individual rights of the citizen on the one hand and the collective rights of the community on the other. Concerns regarding infectious disease outbreaks (SARS, pandemic influenza) have intensified the need to understand public perceptions of quarantine and other social distancing measures.

We conducted a telephone survey of the general population in the Greater Toronto Area in Ontario, Canada. Computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) technology was used. A final sample of 500 individuals was achieved through standard random-digit dialing.

Our data indicate strong public support for the use of quarantine when required and for serious legal sanctions against those who fail to comply. This support is contingent both on the implementation of legal safeguards to protect against inappropriate use and on the provision of psychosocial supports for those affected.

To engender strong public support for quarantine and other restrictive measures, government officials and public health policy-makers would do well to implement a comprehensive system of supports and safeguards, to educate and inform frontline public health workers, and to engage the public at large in an open dialogue on the ethical use of restrictive measures during infectious disease outbreaks.

Long considered an anachronism from a bygone era, quarantine has re-emerged in the 21 st century as an important (albeit controversial) tool in the battle against infectious disease. Prior to the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), it had been more than 50 years since mass quarantine measures had been invoked in North America [1] . The SARS containment measures imposed in Canada and Asia, and on a lesser scale in the U.S., provoked a heated debate within the public health community regarding the ethics and legality of quarantine [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] .

Likewise, the SARS experience has sparked a renewed research interest in the ethics and effectiveness of quarantine. The findings of two recent retrospective studies of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic strongly suggest that it was non-pharmaceutical inventions such as quarantine and other social distancing measures that were most effective in slowing the rate of spread and minimizing the rate of death [8, 9] . And data from SARS-affected regions have pointed to the enduring value and effectiveness of quarantine and other restrictive measures [10, 11] . In contrast, there are those who argue that the use of quarantine during SARS was both ineffective and inefficient [6, 7] . The advent of advanced statistical modelling has added a new dimension to this long-running debate [12, 13] .

Toronto experienced the largest outbreak of SARS in North America, with investigation of 2,132 potential cases and identification of 23,103 contacts of SARS patients who required quarantine [11] . Post-SARS investigations have detected myriad adverse effects among those quarantined: significant feelings of uncertainty, anxiety, and isolation [14] ; experience of stigma, fear, and frustration [15] ; symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder [16] ; and loss of anonymity [17] .

Despite the long and controversial history of quarantine, little is known about lay perceptions of and attitudes toward its modern-day use. In view of the evidence of potential adverse effects on individual well-being and psychosocial health, and owing to the critical necessity of high compliance in the event of a major infectious disease outbreak, it is increasingly important to understand how quarantine is perceived by the general public. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to determine prevailing public attitudes toward the use of quarantine as a means of infectious disease control.

The study was conducted in two regions of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), specifically the City of Toronto proper and the Regional Municipality of York located directly to the north of Toronto. The GTA is among the largest metropolitan areas in North America with a population exceeding 5.5 million [18] . As the urban centre of the GTA, the City of Toronto is a densely-populated, cosmopolitan city (population estimate: 2,500,000; population density: 3,972/km 2 ; visible minority population: 46%). In contrast, York is a much less-densely populated suburban region comprised of several small cities and towns (population estimate: 900,000; population density: 506.7/km 2 ; visible minority population: 30%).

The study sample was stratified to include an equal number of participants from Toronto and York. There was no age or gender stratification. All participants provided verbal consent over the telephone prior to the survey interview. Research ethics approval was obtained from the University of Toronto, Toronto Public Health, and York Region Public Health Unit.

The survey instrument was developed by Toronto Public Health for use in a telephone survey of the general public following the SARS outbreak. The data reported in this paper are derived from a subset of 15 survey items specifically designed to measure public attitudes towards the use of quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. These items addressed issues ranging from the legality of restrictive measures, the perceived effectiveness of quarantine, and the supports that should be supplied to those affected by quarantine orders. Respondents were asked to indicate their level of agreement/disagreement with each item; the response format was a 5-point Likert-type design (1 = "Strongly Disagree"; 2 = "Somewhat Disagree"; 3 = "Neutral"; 4 = "Somewhat Agree"; and 5 = "Strongly Agree").

After the response format was explained and before the first survey item was asked, all participants were provided standardized definitions of 'quarantine' ["Quarantine means that you must stay in a separate area away from others because you were around someone with a serious illness and so you might have it, too."] and 'infectious disease' ["Infectious disease means a sickness that you can catch from another person, like the flu or tuberculosis.]. At the conclusion of the survey, respondents were asked to supply general demographic information.

Data collection occurred between April 25, 2005 and May 16, 2005 . The survey was administered using computerassisted telephone interviewing (CATI) technology. The 15 interviewers received training in advance and worked with the assistance of two project supervisors.

Potential participants were screened for eligibility at the beginning of each call. Inclusion criteria included the following: minimum age of 18 years, primary residence located within the study area during the SARS outbreak, English comprehension skills, and ability to provide informed consent. Those who did not meet the minimum age criteria were asked if another member of the household aged 18 or above was available to participate in the survey. A final sample of 500 individuals was achieved through standard random-digit dialing.

The survey response rate varied slightly by study region. Excluding calls to ineligible participants (i.e., did not meet inclusion criteria) and disqualified numbers (e.g., not in service, wrong number, fax/computer/business line), the final response rate was 27% for the City of Toronto and 31% for York Region.

A factor analysis using Varimax rotation with Kaiser Normalization was performed on the data yielding four factors. Composite index scores were then computed for each factor by summing the responses on items loading on the respective factors. Thus, if a factor comprised five items then individual composite scores for that index could range from 5 to 25.

Bi-variate and multivariate analyses were performed to investigate the inter-relationships among variables. All analyses were performed using SPSS 11.0 for Windows. No statistical weighting of the data was performed.

A total of 500 participants were administered the subset of survey items on quarantine. Table 1 presents a summary of the demographic characteristics of this sample. The majority were middle-aged (56%) and female (64%). Within this sample, 4% of participants were personally impacted by quarantine during the SARS crisis (i.e., either they or someone else in their home was ordered into quarantine). Table 2 presents the distribution of responses for each of the 15 Likert-type survey items (from "Strongly Agree" through to "Strongly Disagree"). In the table, the wording of the individual items is precisely as appeared on the survey instrument; however, for the purposes of presentation, the items are clustered according to the findings of the factor analysis (as described below). As there were no significant differences between respondents from Toronto versus York, the overall results are shown. The vast majority of respondents indicated agreement (either "Strongly Agree" or "Somewhat Agree") that sufficient justification exists for the use of quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. Similarly, most respondents agreed that public health authorities and government officials should endeavour to lessen the burdens endured by those ordered into quarantine. Likewise, there was majority support for the use of various legal sanctions, penalties, and/ or coercive measures in order to maximize compliance with quarantine orders. And, finally, the vast majority of respondents were in favour of safeguards against unwarranted and/or inappropriate use of quarantine. While these high percentages suggest a certain degree of convergence of opinion, it is important to note that the proportion of respondents indicating "Strongly Agree" versus "Somewhat Agree" varies significantly across the 15 items, as indicated in Table 2 .

Finally, survey participants were asked to indicate, by way of forced choice, their response to this statement: "Breaking or not obeying a quarantine order is most like which of the following [choose 1 only]: (a) parking in a no-parking zone; (b) driving way above the speed limit on a busy street; or (c) physical assault." Fully 59% responded that breaking quarantine is most like 'physical assault,' whereas 27% selected 'driving above the speed limit' and 8% chose 'parking in a no-parking zone' (6% did not answer).

Principal components factor analysis of the survey data yielded an underlying factor structure of four independent factors. Based on a subjective analysis of the content of items loading on each individual factor, the four factors were labelled as follows: 'Justification,' 'Sanctions,' 'Burdens,' and 'Safeguards' (as shown in Table 2 ).

Four sub-scales were computed by summing scores for the items within each of the factors identified in the factor analysis. In addition, a total composite index was computed by summing scores across the four sub-scales. Scores on the four sub-scales and composite scale were submitted to age, gender, and regional analysis.

Analysis of variance testing revealed a number of statistically significant age and gender differences. On the 'Justification' sub-scale, female respondents scored significantly higher than males [F = 11.456 (df = 1), p < .001], thereby indicating greater agreement that the use of quarantine is justified in the context of an infectious disease outbreak. With respect to age, older respondents (>65 yrs) indicated greater agreement that use of quarantine is justified than did the young (18-35 yrs) [F = 4.514 (df = 2), p < .01]. Also, older respondents agreed more strongly that the use of sanctions for quarantine absconders is appropriate when compared both with the young and with the middle-aged (36-65 yrs) [F = 4.577 (df = 2), p < .01]. There were no significant differences by region.

The quarantine of exposed persons (along with the isolation of infected persons) has been properly described as the most complex and most ethically and legally controversial intervention within the jurisdiction of public health [19] . Complexity and controversy notwithstanding, the present data indicate a very high rate of public acceptance of quarantine as a means to control the spread of infectious disease. Indeed, the vast majority of respondents indicated strong support for the use of quarantine in an infectious disease outbreak, for legal penalties against absconders, for social supports for those affected, and for public safeguards against potential inappropriate use.

Data on public attitudes toward quarantine in the wake of SARS are scarce. Public opinion polls have indicated high levels of acceptance of quarantine among samples of Toronto-area residents (97%) and US citizens (93%) [20] . These findings are supported by an observed non-compliance rate of only 0.1% among Torontonians requiring quarantine during SARS [11] . A qualitative study of factors influencing compliance with quarantine in Toronto identified 'protection of the health of the community' as a prominent motivating factor. The authors of the study concluded that "while the overall compliance rate among residents of the GTA appears to have been high, the influence of 'civic duty' and social responsibility may not be as significant in other countries and cultures" [21] .

Comparative data from international studies do lend support to the theory that cultural values and societal norms impact upon quarantine compliance rates. Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveyed residents of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and the U.S. and found significant regional variability [22] . The proportion of survey respondents favouring the quarantine of persons suspected of having been exposed to a serious contagious disease was as follows: 76% in the U.S., 81% in Hong Kong, 89% in Singapore, and 95% in Taiwan. By way of comparison, in the present study, 94% of respondents agreed that quarantine is a good way to stop the spread of infectious disease outbreaks. Interestingly, in our study, significantly fewer (58%) agreed that public health officials should be able to detain those who fail to obey quarantine orders. Likewise, in the Harvard study, the proportions favouring the use of quarantine decrease significantly if people could be arrested for refusing (to a low of only 42% in the U.S. to a high of 70% in Taiwan). The authors partially attributed the observed differences to prior experience with infectious disease outbreaks in which quarantine and other restrictive measures were implemented [21] .

In view of this inter-region variability, it is not surprising that the global community of public health experts is itself conflicted about the use of quarantine and other restrictive measures that impinge upon the intrinsic rights of individuals. Those who favour the consideration of quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks maintain that it is prudent public health policy [23] , whereas those in opposition argue that quarantine is inherently paternalistic and an unnecessary breach of basic human rights [24] . Despite the difference of opinion, however, there does appear to be general agreement on this: "ultimately, public health must rely not on force but on persuasion, and not on blind trust but on trust based on transparency, accountability, democracy, and human rights" [24] .

With a view to fostering further deliberation and constructive debate, we are proposing a conceptual framework for the ethical use of restrictive measures in public health emergencies (see Figure 1 ). Building upon previous theoretical work on the justification for public health intervention [25] , our model is designed to reflect the dynamic interplay among theory, empirical evidence, and policy/ practice that is inherent to public health. To that end, we have incorporated the empirical data from the public opinion survey described in this paper. The model explicitly contemplates the four primary functions of public health as regards the use of restrictive measures in infectous disease outbreaks, namely, response, enforcement, support, and oversight. For instance, with respect to the enforcement of quarantine orders, the model illustrates how the specific function of enforcement aligns with the ethical principle of the 'least restrictive means' and is likewise concordant with empirical evidence indicating strong public support for the use of sanctions to promote compliance with quarantine orders (survey data reported here). This conceptual framework for the ethical use of restrictive measures in public health emergencies should be considered provisional and, as such, is open to further testing and refinement.

Much has been learned from the unexpected arrival of SARS in the spring of 2003 [26, 27] . Likewise, we continue to learn from historical analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic, with one recent study providing strong support for the hypothesis that early implementation of public health measures such as quarantine can significantly reduce influenza transmission [9] . Given the current threat posed by pandemic influenza, it is incumbent upon the public health community-including ethicists and legal experts-to delineate both the limits to individual liberty and the obligations of public health authorities in the context of an infectious disease outbreak. It is noteworthy that the concept of 'voluntary quarantine' features prominently in many of the current plans for pandemic influenza. As contrasted with the classic quarantine order, which is typically enforceable by law, voluntary household quarantine refers to compliance based on the individual's own free will without legal compulsion.

Owing to the global threat of pandemic influenza, considerable planning and preparation for infectious disease outbreaks has been undertaken [28] . There remains a pressing need, however, to engage the citizenry more fully in the process of preparedness planning in order to ensure that the plans reflect the common will and that the policies serve the common good [29] . In this regard, the continuing growth in interest and activity in the subfield of public health ethics is certainly welcome and holds greats promise.

While we believe the data reported here contribute to the goal of better planning and better preparedness, the present study is limited by its sample of respondents who were drawn only from the Greater Toronto Area. Our goal was to assess the attitudes and perceptions of those living in an area significantly impacted by the SARS outbreak, but further research is now required to determine the generalizability of the present findings to other geographic regions and other populations. Also, our survey was conducted after the conclusion of the outbreak; it is conceivable that public perceptions and attitudes toward the use of restrictive measures could be different during the course of an outbreak. Finally, a relatively small proportion of our survey respondents were directly affected by quarantine during SARS, which precluded any analysis of differences between those who were directly affected and those who were not.

The use of restrictive measures such as quarantine draws into sharp relief the push and pull of opposing forces that characterize the dynamic interplay between the personal autonomy of the citizen on the one hand and the collective rights of the community on the other. As Bensimon and Upshur [3] have argued, justification for quarantine cannot be founded upon scientific evidence alone; rather, the decision to implement quarantine should be equally An emerging conceptual framework for the ethical use of restrictive measures Figure 1 An emerging conceptual framework for the ethical use of restrictive measures. ii.

informed by the values, preferences, and practices of the affected communities. The present findings indicate strong public support for the use of quarantine in the context of an infectious disease outbreak and for serious sanctions against those who fail to comply. Our data further suggest, however, that public support for quarantine is contingent on the implementation both of legal safeguards to protect against inappropriate use and of psychosocial supports to provide for individuals who are adversely affected. This tension between individual rights and the greater public good is precisely the challenge that infectious disease presents to public health ethics. In order to engender strong public support for the use of quarantine and other restrictive measures, government officials and public health policy-makers would do well to implement a comprehensive system of supports and safeguards, to educate and inform frontline public health workers, and to engage the public at large in an open dialogue on the ethical use of restrictive measures during infectious disease outbreaks.

Bacterial and viral pathogen spectra of acute respiratory infections in under-5 children in hospital settings in Dhaka city

The study aimed to examine for the first time the spectra of viral and bacterial pathogens along with the antibiotic susceptibility of the isolated bacteria in under-5 children with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in hospital settings of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Nasal swabs were collected from 200 under-five children hospitalized with clinical signs of ARIs. Nasal swabs from 30 asymptomatic children were also collected. Screening of viral pathogens targeted ten respiratory viruses using RT-qPCR. Bacterial pathogens were identified by bacteriological culture methods and antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates was determined following CLSI guidelines. About 82.5% (n = 165) of specimens were positive for pathogens. Of 165 infected cases, 3% (n = 6) had only single bacterial pathogens, whereas 43.5% (n = 87) cases had only single viral pathogens. The remaining 36% (n = 72) cases had coinfections. In symptomatic cases, human rhinovirus was detected as the predominant virus (31.5%), followed by RSV (31%), HMPV (13%), HBoV (11%), HPIV-3 (10.5%), and adenovirus (7%). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogen (9%), whereas Klebsiella pneumaniae, Streptococcus spp., Enterobacter agglomerans, and Haemophilus influenzae were 5.5%, 5%, 2%, and 1.5%, respectively. Of 15 multidrug-resistant bacteria, a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate and an Enterobacter agglomerans isolate exhibited resistance against more than 10 different antibiotics. Both ARI incidence and predominant pathogen detection rates were higher during post-monsoon and winter, peaking in September. Pathogen detection PLOS ONE | https://doi.

Introduction Acute respiratory infections (ARIs), in particular, pneumonia, remain the persistent and pervasive deterrent to public health. It is responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in children <5 years of age. But the death rate due to ARI is mostly concentrated in developing regions like Africa and Southeast Asia. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that acute respiratory infections account for 1.9 to 2.2 million childhood deaths annually, with 70% occurring in Africa and Southeast Asia [1, 2] . The definition of ARI includes all infections of the respiratory tract. However, a majority of respiratory deaths are attributed to acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs). The incidence of ALRIs in children aged less than 5 years is estimated to be 0.22 episodes per childyear, with most cases occurring in India, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Nigeria [3, 4] .

The etiological agents for ARIs include bacteria, virus and fungi. The most commonly associated ARI-causing bacterial organisms are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus etc. Other atypical bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Klebsiella pneumaniae are less frequently reported [5, 6] . Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses type A and B, human parainfluenza viruses type 1, 2, and 3 (HPIV-1, HPIV-2 and HPIV-3), adenoviruses (ADV) and human metapneumoviruses (HMPV) are most frequently detected in children with ARIs [7, 8] . Respiratory viruses are considered as major contributors to ARI in children and they are associated with almost 60% of ALRIs [9] .

Although numerous pathogens are associated with ARIs, the clinical manifestations of ARIs are almost similar in all cases, irrespective of causative agents. So, detection of the potential causative agents is the prerequisite for proper treatment and viral detection can reduce the irrational and overuse of antibiotics. ARIs due to bacterial infections have become a global concern especially because of the emergence of an increasing number of multi-drug resistant bacteria. Although some studies have examined the viral etiology of ARIs in the under-five children in Bangladesh, information is lacking on bacterial pathogens and their antibiotic resistance/sensitivity pattern [10, 11] . Lack of information regarding etiological agents influences the use of inappropriate and broad spectrum antibiotics which in turn fosters antimicrobial resistance. The purpose of this study was to examine both viral and bacterial pathogens of ARIs among under-five children of Bangladesh in hospital settings over a period of 1 year. The viral pathogens were identified using RT-qPCR targeting 10 common respiratory viruses and microbiological culture method was used to examine pathogenic bacterial spectrum and determine their antibiotic susceptibility pattern.

This is a prospective investigation of acute respiratory infections in under-five children in hospital-care settings in Dhaka city. A total of 200 patients who had acute respiratory infections (ARIs), as manifested by clinical signs and symptoms and/or chest X-ray report suggestive of pneumonia admitted to the pediatric units of Dhaka Medical College Hospital and Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, were enrolled in this study over a period of 1 year from August 2014 to July 2015. 30 (15 from each of 2 hospitals) asymptomatic under-five children who were admitted to the hospital because of complications other than respiratory infections were also enrolled during the study period. Prior to enrollment, a written informed consent was obtained from each child's parents or legal guardians. Patients with a history of chronic respiratory infections or patients whose parents'/guardians refused to give consent were excluded from the study. In addition to name, address, height, weight and temperature, patients' demographic data such as age and gender were recorded on a standard form at the time of specimen collection. Vital signs including heart rate and respiratory rate were also recorded at the same time. Nasal swab specimens were collected from each participant. The study was conducted in the Institute for Developing Science and Health Initiatives (IDESHI), Dhaka, Bangladesh. This study was ethically approved by the ethics review committee of Bangladesh Medical Research Council (BMRC).

Nasal swabs (NSs) were collected from enrolled participants by trained medical assistants. A sterile cotton flocked swab was soaked in saline and then placed approximately 1 to 1.5 cm into the nostrils and rotated against the anterior nasal mucosa for 3 seconds. The procedure was repeated using another swab. One of the 2 NSs was placed into viral transport media (VTM) (DMEM, Gibco-BRL, Life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland; penicillin 10,000 U/ml, and streptomycin 10,000 IU/ml, BioWhittaker, MA; NaHCO 3 ; HEPES buffer, 1M, Gibco; L-Glutamate 200 mM; Fungizone (Amphotericin B) 250 μg/ml; bovine serum albumin, Fraction V, 7.5%, Gibco) for detection of viral pathogens, whereas the other one was placed in STGG (skim milk tryptone glucose glycerol) media for bacterial culture. The collected specimens were immediately placed at 2-8˚C and transported to IDESHI laboratory. The specimens had been collected before the patients received any antibiotic treatment at the hospital. Specimens that had been collected in STGG media were subjected to a bacterial culture within 4 hours of collection, whereas specimens in VTM were stored at -70˚C for later detection of viral pathogens by RT-qPCR.

The nasal swabs in STGG media were enriched for 4 hours in Todd Hewitt media supplemented with 20% rabbit serum. The bacterial pathogens were then isolated using selective media including MacConkey Agar, Blood Agar with Gentamicin, and Chocolate Agar. After morphology-dependent selection, colonies were identified by specific tests where necessary such as, optochin sensitivity and bile solubility tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae, tests for requirement of growth factors X, V and XV for Haemophilus influenzae and appropriate biochemical tests including TSI (Triple Sugar Iron), Citrate, MIU (Motility Indole Urea) media, and Analytical Profiling Index API 1 20E (bioMérieux, St. Louis, USA) for Enterobacteriaceae like Klebsiella pneumoniae. Profiling of antimicrobial susceptibility/resistance was performed by the modified disc diffusion method and the bacterial strains were identified as either sensitive or resistant to an antibiotic based on the diameter of inhibition zone interpretative chart, published in Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) guidelines 2014.

Viral nucleic acids were extracted from nasal swab specimens that had been collected in VTM using PureLink 1 Viral RNA/DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen, CA, USA). The extracted nucleic acids were then subjected to single-plex reverse transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR) for detection of respiratory viruses including human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B, human parainfluenza viruses type 1 to 3 (HPIV1, HPIV2, HPIV3), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), adenovirus, and human bocavirus (HBoV). The RT-qPCR was done using AgPath-ID™ One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen, CA, USA) and CFX96 Touch™ Real-Time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). The results of RT-qPCR were considered positive if an exponential fluorescence curve could cross the assigned threshold at C t <40.0. Previously published primers and probes were used for viral pathogen detection by RT-qPCR [12] [13] [14] [15] .

Two-tailed chi-square test (two by two table) was performed using http://www.openepi.com/ website to calculate the prevalence of the identified pathogens and coinfection frequencies in different age groups. The relative risk ratio (RR) and odds ratio (OR) were estimated at 95% confidence interval (CI). Fisher's exact test using GraphPad Prism 5.0 was done for comparison of pathogen frequencies between symptomatic and asymptomatic children as some of the values were less than five. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.

Prior to enrollment, all the children were examined for clinical signs and symptoms by attending physicians to suspect ARIs. The suspected patients were then subjected to chest X-ray. 62% (n = 124) of hospitalized symptomatic children were male, while the rest 38% were female. The mean age of the symptomatic children was 9.6 months and 47% (n = 94) of children were under six months of age and 78.5% (n = 157) were less than one year old. On the other hand, the mean age of the asymptomatic children was 12.62 months. All the children including their parents/guardians were residents of Dhaka city.

A total of 200 children with ARI illness were enrolled over 1 year period from August 2014 to July 2015. Fig 1 demonstrates the month-wise rate of specimen collection from enrolled patients. The rate of specimen collection reached a peak in September (30%; 60/200)), followed by a sharp decline in October (6.5%; n = 13). After October, a gradual increase in the rate of specimen collection was observed during the months of November, December, and January, with the rate of 8% (n = 16), 10% (n = 20), and 16% (n = 32), respectively.

Again, after January, there was a gradual decline in specimen collection rate from February (8.5%; n = 17) to May (0%), followed by 2% (n = 4) and 1% (n = 2) collection rates in June and July, respectively. The specimen collection rate started rising sharply in August (11%; n = 22). In brief, most of the specimens (90%; n = 180) were collected during the study period between August and February. Further analysis of seasonality in terms of individual viral and bacterial pathogens will be elaborated in the later part of the article.

Next, we wanted to detect and identify different ARI-associated bacterial pathogens in underfive children. Conventional microbiological culture methods and biochemical tests were used to isolate and identify bacterial pathogens in the specimens. Among 200 symptomatic specimens, 43 specimens (21.5%) came out as culture positive (Fig 2A) .

Taking into account of both single infection and coinfection cases of bacterial infections, 46 bacterial pathogens were isolated from symptomatic children; and the most commonly isolated bacteria were S. pneumoniae (18/46; 39%), followed by K. pneumaniae (11/46; 24%), Streptococcus spp. (10/46; 22%), E. agglomerans (4/46; 9%), and H. influenzae (3/46; 6%) ( Fig  2B) . On the other hand, 7% (2 out of 30) nasal swab specimens which had been collected from asymptomatic participants were culture positive and only S. pneumoniae was found in both cases. The data obtained from symptomatic cases demonstrate for the first time that E. agglomerans might play a role as one of the major bacterial pathogens (9%) of ARIs in under-five children in Bangladesh (Fig 2B) .

Since antibiotic resistance, which is an interdisciplinary global concern, is emerging in an alarmingly increasing manner, the study also aimed to investigate antibiotic resistance patterns for the isolated bacteria. Table 1 shows that the S. pneumoniae isolates that had been found as the predominating bacterial agent colonizing the under-five ARI children were all sensitive to Table 1 . Resistance pattern of the isolated bacteria to first line of antibiotics.

first line antibiotics including penicillin and ampicillin as well as levofloxacin, an aminoglycoside. In addition, 95% S. pneumoniae isolates showed sensitivity to ceftriaxone and 84% showed sensitivity to cefixime. However, a disappointing antibiotic resistance pattern for S. pneumoniae was observed for other antibiotics including erythromycin, azithromycin, and cotrimoxazole, showing resistance frequencies of 44%, 61%, and 89%, respectively. The antibiotic susceptibility test data demonstrate an alarming resistance level of K. pneumaniae, showing 100% resistance against azithromycin, 55% resistance against each of ceftriaxone, cefixime and ciprofloxacin; 27% and 45% resistance frequencies against Gentamicin and Tobramycin, respectively. Only carbapenem group of antibiotics including imipenem and meropenem had exhibited 100% sensitivity against K. pneumaniae in vitro (Table 1) .

More concerning it is that one of the K. pneumoniae isolates showed resistance to all available antibiotics including all the first line and second line antibiotics ( Table 2) . Antibiotic resistance patterns for the next predominating ARI agent Streptococcus species (n = 10) were also alarming because there was 30% to 80% resistance frequency for all antibiotics except ceftriaxone. For E. agglomerans, 3 out of 4 isolates showed resistance to antibiotics like azithromycin, ceftriaxone, cefixime, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin, whereas 2 isolates showed resistance to gentamicin. Even the carbapenems-imipenem and meropenem appeared ineffective against one E. agglomerans isolate, which showed resistance to all antibiotics. Finally, at least 1 of 3 isolates of H. influenzae showed some degrees of resistance to the antibiotics tested for antibiogram study.

Two multi-drug resistant bacterial strains-one K. pneumaniae isolate and one E. agglomerans isolate were resistant not only to all first line of antibiotics but also to all tested second line of antibiotics (Table 2) .

In summary, if in vitro antibiotic resistance patterns found in this study match in vivo resistance patterns, it can be concluded that the antibiotic resistance levels have possibly crossed the danger line for K. pneumoniae, Streptococcus species, E. agglomerans, and H. influenzae, although S. pneumoniae still exhibits sensitivity to a good number of antibiotics. It should be mentioned here that two isolates of S. pneumoniae from asymptomatic ARI participants showed an antibiotic sensitivity pattern similar to that of S. pneumoniae isolates from symptomatic children (data not shown).

Next, the study focused on the detection of viral pathogens (Tables 3 and 4 ). RT-qPCR method was adopted to detect a panel of 10 different respiratory viruses. About 79% (158/200) of enrolled ARI patients were laboratory-confirmed for viral infections with either single viral infections (54.5%; n = 109) or infections with more than one viruses (24.5%; n = 49). Although the number of viral infected patients was 158, the total number of virus detected in this study Modified disc diffusion method was used for profiling of antimicrobial susceptibility/resistance. Bacterial strains were identified as either sensitive or resistant to an antibiotic based on the diameter of the inhibition zone interpretative, as manifested by CLSI.

was 213 because of the presence of multiple viral pathogens in same specimen ( Table 3) Other respiratory viral pathogens that had been detected included Influenza A in 3 specimens, Influenza B in 1 specimen and HPIV-1 in 1 specimen. Among the bacterial culture positive patients described in Table 4 , 17.5% (n = 35) had coinfections with viral pathogens.

For appropriate preventive measures and prompt interventions, determination of vulnerable age groups is important. Table 3 shows a comparison of distribution patterns of indicated respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens between <1 year and 1-5 year age groups. As we can see here, the total number of specimens which had come out positive for pathogens was significantly higher in less than one year age group (87%) compared to [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] The majority of respiratory viral pathogens were highly prevalent in <1 year age group of children and the detections of HRV (54/63) and RSV (54/62) were almost confined to this age group. However, a significant P value was found in case of RSV (P = 0.0473, RR = 1.167 (7) 10 (6) 4 (9) NA -- (8/11) were confined to less than 1 year old children, although the results did not show significant differences between the two age groups. Notably, pathogen detection rates dropped to almost 2% for all viruses for more than three-year old children (data not shown). Due to nil or very low levels of pathogen detection frequency (less than five), χ 2 -test was not performed for pathogens other than HRV, RSV, HBoV, and HMPV. Over all, the data suggest that under-one children are more likely to receive attention due to their vulnerability to infections by respiratory viral pathogens. Coinfection is a frequently occurring phenomenon in numerous infections and this phenomenon has attracted a great deal of recent attention. Respiratory viral pathogens including influenza virus have been reported to predispose to secondary bacterial pulmonary infections [16] , hence, data analysis targeting coinfection patterns was performed. Out of 46 bacterial isolates, 40 (87%) were associated with coinfections. On the other hand, 59% (126 out of 213) of total viral agents were accomplices in coinfections. In summary, the data indicate that coinfection is a major phenomenon in under-five children with ARI illness and the results are consistent with previously published reports on this subject.

For bacteria, the rates of coinfections of S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, Streptococcus species, E. agglomerans and H. influenza were 94%, 90%, 70%, 75% and 100% respectively. On the other hand, the rates of coinfections of predominantly detected respiratory viral pathogens including HRV, RSV, HMPV, HPIV-3, HBoV, and adenovirus were 63.5%, 52%, 42%, 71%, 50% and 93%, respectively. In 72 coinfected cases, 52 showed a pair-wise fashion of co-occurrences of pathogens, whereas 18 showed pathogen co-occurrences in a tri-partner manner. In two cases, up to four pathogens were detected in each specimen. Interestingly, coinfection partners of adenovirus were mostly confined to viruses including 5 RSV, 4 HRV, 3HPIV-3, 1 influenza A, 1 HMPV, 1 HBoV, whereas there was only one co-detection of bacterial isolates (E. agglomerans) with adenovirus (Table 4 ). Among 16 parainfluenza coinfection cases, 15 were HPIV-3 and 1 was HPIV-1. Although major HPIV-3 coinfection partners included HRV, RSV, adenovirus, S. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae, one HPIV-1 case was co-detected with RSV and HBoV. On the other hand, 5 out of 11 HMPV coinfection partners included bacteria like S. pneumoniae (two), K. pneumoniae (one), and one Streptococcus species as well as viral pathogens including HRV (five), HPIV-3, HBoV and adenovirus.

Also, we analyzed coinfection data in terms of co-occurrences of 2 or more pathogens in the host, such as viral-viral, viral-bacterial, viral-viral-bacterial, and viral-bacterial-bacterial patterns. As we can see in Table 4 , HRV was observed as the most predominant coinfection partner, showing its presence with almost all of the pathogens. The major coinfection viral partners of HRV included RSV (six), HPIV-3 (five) HMPV (four), adenovirus (four), HBoV (three), and Inf A (one) viruses. In addition, HRV was co-detected in 9 out of 10 K. pneumoniae infection cases, whereas it was co-detected in only five S. pneumoniae cases. After HRV, RSV was the second most predominant pathogen and it was co-detected mainly with S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, Streptococcus species, E. agglomerans, and H. influenzae and a total of 20 bacterial isolates had been found with RSV.

Other than co-detection with bacteria, RSV was also co-detected with adenovirus in 5 specimens, HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 in 1 and 3 cases, respectively. HMPV was more likely to be identified in single infections, whereas adenovirus, S. pneumoniae, and K. pneumaniae were mostly identified in coinfection cases. Although HBoV was equally detected in both single and coinfection cases, 63.09% of HBoV which had been found in coinfected cases were observed as a partner with HRV (7 cases). Among 3 Influenza A positive cases, one had been detected without any coinfection partner and 2 had coinfections with adenovirus and HRV (shown in Table 4 ). The only case of Influenza B virus had coinfection with S. pneumoniae.

Next, we wanted to analyze the distribution patterns of major viral and bacterial pathogens between single infections and mixed infections. Fig 3A indicates that the numbers of coinfected cases of HRV, HPIV-3, and adenovirus were significantly higher than that of single infection cases, generating significant P values of 0.0001, 0.009, and 0.0001, respectively. In cases of RSV, HMPV, and HBoV, no significant differences in frequency were observed between cases of single infections and coinfections for each viral agent. We also analyzed coinfection status in terms of bacterial pathogens. As we can see in Fig 3B, the numbers of cases where S. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae had been found as coinfection partners were 17 (n = 18) and 10 (n = 11), respectively.

The comparisons between frequencies of single infections and coinfections for S. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae generated significant P-values of 0.0001 and 0.001, respectively. For Streptococcus species, although coinfection cases were higher than single infection cases, the difference did not generate a significant P value. Higher rates of bacterial coinfections by S. pneumoniae and K pneumoniae in synergy with viruses may indicate that predominant ARI viruses predispose their hosts to secondary infections by bacteria.

Recent studies of asymptomatic ARI cases reported the frequent presence of respiratory pathogens like HRV, adenovirus, S. pneumoniae etc. In this study, we collected 30 asymptomatic specimens. 43% (n = 13) of those asymptomatic children were positive for pathogen(s). However, the detection rate of pathogens in symptomatic specimens (82.5%) was significantly higher than that of in asymptomatic specimens (P< 0.0001) ( Table 5) .

HRV was the most prevalent pathogen in both symptomatic (31.5%) and asymptomatic (23%) cases. However, the difference in detection rates of HRV between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases did not generate a significant P-value (P = 0.404). For adenovirus, the rate of pathogen detection was higher in asymptomatic specimens (10%) than that of in symptomatic specimens (7%), although the difference in detection rate between these two categories of specimens was not statistically significant. Similarly, for HMPV and S. pneumoniae, the difference in detection rate between the symptomatic and asymptomatic attacks were not significant (P = 0.219 and P = 1.00, respectively). On the other hand, RSV detection rate was significantly higher in symptomatic specimens than asymptomatic specimen (P = 0.004), suggesting the potential involvement of RSV in ARI illness. Finally, multiple pathogens were detected in only 7% (2/30) of asymptomatic specimens and this detection rate was significantly lower than the detection rate of multiple pathogens in symptomatic specimens (36%, P = 0.0007), implying possible pathogenic role of multiple pathogens in ARI symptoms. It is mentionable here that we couldn't detect any other bacteria other than two isolates of S. pneumoniae in 30 asymptomatic cases. 

In Fig 1, we observed seasonal variation in terms of specimen collection rates but not the actual pathogen detection rates. Therefore, it is important to know true seasonality for each of the individual viral and bacterial pathogens. As we can see in Fig 4A , HRV reached its highest peak (n = 15) in September and 2 nd highest peak in November (n = 10). In addition, there were six HRV positive specimens in October. From January to August, HRV circulation was roughly constant, indicating HRV transmission throughout the year. Similar to HRV, the number of RSV-infected patients reached its peak in September, when 41 (66%) of 62 patients were hospitalized. On the other hand, the hospitalization rates of RSV patients were 26% (n = 16), 4.8% (n = 3), 1.6% (n = 1), and 1.6% (n = 1) in August, October, November, and December, respectively, whereas there were no detections of RSV-infected patients in other months. These findings suggest that RSV circulation was highly confined in August and September. In contrast to RSV, HMPV circulation reached its peak (50%, n = 13) in January, followed by 23% (n = 6), 19% (n = 5), and 8% circulation in February, December, and September. There were no enrollments of HMPV-infected patients in other months. After HRV, RSV, and HMPV, HBoV had the fourth highest detection rates in terms of numbers of HBoV-infected patients and all of them were detected between September and March. HPIV-3 showed 2 peaks-1 in September and another in November, each representing 6 patients, indicating hospitalization of 56% (n = 12) of HPIV-3-infected patients in these 2 months. The rest 9 of 21 HPIV-3 patients were hospitalized in August, October, December, January, and February with hospitalization rates of 10% (n = 2), 14% (n = 3), 5% (n = 1), 10% (n = 2), and 5% (n = 1), respectively. On the other hand, hospitalization rates of adenovirusinfected patients were 36% (n = 5), 21% (n = 3), 10% (n = 2), 5% (n = 1), 10% (n = 2), and 5% (n = 1) in August, November, January, February, April, and June, respectively. Other viruses of the viral panel including HPIV-1, HPIV-2, influenza A, and influenza B appeared in small numbers of patients and were not informative for determination of seasonality. Next, we analyzed seasonality of ARI-causing bacterial pathogens. Fig 4B demonstrates that the most prevalent bacterial pathogen S. pneumoniae started appearing in August with four patients and the Acute respiratory infections in under-5 children in Dhaka number of infected patients reached its peak in September, showing hospitalization of 9 (50%) out of 18 patients. There was only one patient enrolled in each of the months of October, November, December, January, and February for S. pneumoniae-associated hospitalization. On the other hand, the number of second most prevalent bacterial pathogen K. pneumoniae showed its peak circulation in September, as manifested by 5 cases (46%) of K. pneumoniaeassociated hospitalization in this month, followed by 3 (27%), 1 (9%), and 2 (18%) hospitalized cases in October, November, and January. Like S. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae, Streptococcus species had a peak circulation in September with 4 (40%) hospitalized patients.

The rest 6 of the 10 patients infected with Streptococcus species were hospitalized in August (n = 1), October (n = 1), November (n = 1), January (n = 1), and February (n = 2). Interestingly, circulation of all 3 (100%) H. influenzae isolates were confined in September. Unlike the above-mentioned bacterial pathogens which had a peak circulation in September, E. agglomerans had a peak circulation in August with only 2 (50%) patients.

Thus, the data suggest that all of the bacterial isolates except E. agglomerans had a peak circulation in September, which is also the peak season for the most predominant viral agent RSV and this phenomenon of simultaneous occurrences of viral and bacterial pathogens may facilitate huge numbers of bacterial coinfections with RSV.

The study demonstrates for the first time the simultaneous detection of viral and bacterial etiologies of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in under-5 children in hospital-care settings in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Major focal points of the study included (a) determination of seasonal variation in terms of ARI specimen collection rates as well as seasonality of isolated ARI pathogens, (b) in vitro antibiotic resistance/sensitivity assay for bacterial pathogens, (c) coinfection patterns, (d) age-dependent distribution patterns of pathogens, and (e) a comparison of the detection rates of respiratory pathogens between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. Knowing the seasonal variability of pathogens would help the parents or guardians of the children as well as physicians to adopt some preventive measures. Antibiogram study was designed to know the condition of antibiotic resistance/sensitivity patterns of major ARI bacterial pathogens to avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics to treat ARI patients, which also might help control of the rapid emergence of antibiotic resistant strains. Analysis of coinfection status was performed to identify major coinfection partners in terms of virus-bacteria, virusvirus, bacteria-bacteria, virus-bacteria-bacteria, and virus-virus-bacteria. Especially specific identification of bacteria in a coinfection case may help the physicians to choose appropriate antibiotics and additional medications because bacterial coinfection, especially superinfection has been reported to associate with huge fatal outcomes and deaths of under-five ARI patients. On the other hand, age-dependent distribution patterns of pathogens are useful to identify vulnerable age groups.

Information on seasonal variability would be helpful to create an extra awareness among the community and health professionals including physicians and nurses. Preventive measures including personal and in-house hygiene and cleanliness, and proper ventilation may be adopted across the peak ARI season. Other preventive measures include avoiding crowded public places and making a habit of frequent hand washing etc. Our data demonstrate that the majority of 200 symptomatic specimens were collected between August and February corresponding to post-monsoon and winter. In this region, the temperature mostly remains low in these months and it is commonly known that respiratory illness incidence rate is higher in winter. Winter season has bad reputation not only for upper respiratory tract infections caused by a large number of viruses but also for lower respiratory tract infections including pneumonia [17, 18] . Our study demonstrates that the most predominantly detected viral pathogen HRV was circulated throughout the year without showing any clear seasonal distribution. On the other hand, the peak circulation of the second most prevalent viral pathogen RSV was seen in September. HMPV showed its seasonal peak in January. The findings regarding winter seasonality of viral pathogens are thus consistent with previous studies of respiratory viral pathogen detections in Bangladesh [10, 19] . Similar to the majority of viral pathogens, the bacterial pathogens including S. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae, showed their peak circulations in September. So, the vulnerable group of children of the country requires appropriate preventive measures against ARI across the post monsoon and winter. However, this was a one-year study and the time period is meager to substantiate any seasonality of the pathogens.

Irrespective of single or coinfections, our experimental approach could successfully identify viral and/or bacterial pathogens in 165 (82.5%) symptomatic cases of participants, whereas 35 cases remained undetected of any pathogens. A community-based study conducted in Bangladesh could identify respiratory viral pathogens in only 66% of ARI cases and the detection rate was lower than the detection rate calculated for this study [10] . However, the study did not consider bacterial pathogens. On the other hand, the studies of respiratory infections among children of Zambia and Madagascar reported the detection rates of respiratory pathogens in 76.8% and 74.6% specimens, respectively, and these studies focused on the detection of both viral and atypical bacterial pathogens [20, 21] . A similar study conducted in China demonstrated 67.5% overall pathogen detection rate [22] . These all suggest that our findings in terms of pathogen detection are consistent with the reported data of similar studies.

Although the viruses are the most common etiological agents of ARIs, a wide variety of bacterial pathogens are also associated with ARIs either as single or mixed agents with viruses. The bacterial etiology is not investigated in most of the ARI-associated studies. Even in countries like the USA where pneumonia surveillance is routinely conducted, the bacterial etiology is not recorded in 65-85% of hospitalized pneumonia cases [23, 24] . It cannot be rule out that the presence of bacteria as coinfection partners with viruses may complicate the clinical symptoms of ARI illness leading to fatal outcomes. As such, the study was designed to focus not only on bacterial detection but also on antibiotic sensitivity/resistance patterns of the isolated bacterial strains.

Our microbiological culture method could detect bacterial pathogens in 21.5% cases, although the majority of bacterial pathogens had been co-detected with viruses. The most commonly isolated bacteria were S. pneumoniae (39%) and K. pneumaniae (24%). H. influenzae was identified in 6% cases. Along with S. pneumoniae and K. pneumaniae, we could also detect Streptococcus spp. (22%) and E. agglomerans (9%). S. pneumoniae is a predominant cause of <5 child mortality and despite the vaccination program, it is responsible for at least 18% of severe respiratory episodes and 33% of deaths worldwide [25] . Other studies conducted in Kenya, Zambia, Nepal, and Brazil reported S. pneumoniae as the most frequently isolated bacteria and the isolation rate ranged from 15.8-54.8% [26] [27] [28] [29] . K. pneumoniae had been described as the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in Jordan and India [30, 31] . It is known that bacterial colonization is mostly facilitated by physical damages of respiratory cells caused by viral infection. However, Yu et al. reported that bacterial colonization following viral infection has no effect on clinical manifestation of ARIs [32] . Furthermore, the role of bacterial pathogens in ARI symptoms is ambiguous as recent studies of asymptomatic ARI cases reported frequent bacterial colonization [33] and our study also found comparable detection rates of S. pneumoniae in both asymptomatic and symptomatic children. Many of the bacteria found as coinfection partners with virus in this study, are pathogenic. When bacteria enter a body, the host must elicit immune responses against the invading organisms. However, the immune responses are not always beneficial and sometimes these responses can be harmful, such as in case of hyper immune responses. Even the immune responses elicited by one organism may compromise the immune responses elicited by another organism. Although the pathogenic role of bacterial coinfections with viruses is unclear, they might have involvement in disease pathogenicity. One study reported that, colonization of pathogenic bacteria in airway stimulate topical immune responses [34] and this phenomenon may play important role in compromising host immune responses. Most of the bacteria isolated during the study period including S. pneumoniae, K. pneumaniae, H. influenzae, and E. agglomerans fall in either community-acquired or nosocomical categories, suggesting appropriate preventive measures could limit bacterial involvement in ARIs.

Increasing antibiotic resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics makes bacterial infections a major threat to public health worldwide. As we have described in result section, our in vitro antibiotic resistance patterns were concerning in the sense that most of the isolates except S. pneumaniae, such as K. pneumaniae, Streptococcus species, H. influenzae, and E. agglomerans exhibited alarming levels of resistance against the majority of available first line of antibiotics. Even two of 15 multidrug-resistant isolates (K. pneumaniae and E. agglomerans) displayed resistance not only against all the first-line of antibiotics but also against all the second-line of antibiotics. Despite the advances in therapeutic and preventive measures, the emerging resistance to the antibiotics is a growing concern among clinicians and other health professionals worldwide. The indiscriminate and unreasonable use of antibiotics have contributed to the emergence of resistance, which may turn out to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing countries. A tailored antibiotic treatment is in demand to tackle this major issue, but the dearth of information regarding the etiological agents and antibiotic sensitivity patterns in countries like Bangladesh have made it difficult. The information regarding antibiotic resistance patterns provided here in this study is expected to raise alertness among physicians, community people, as well as among policy makers of public and private sectors in the country.

Single-plex reverse transcription real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) method could detect the presence 213 viruses in 158 (79%) children. The findings corroborate the concept of viruses being the most common causative agent of ARIs and the data are consistent with hospital-based findings in Bangladesh reported by Homaira et al. [11] and the comparable 's were also published from Laos and Egypt [35, 36] . However, many studies in other regions including Brazil, Niger, Zambia, Spain, and Mexico reported higher viral detection rates ranging from 65-87% [26, [37] [38] [39] [40] . The disparity in viral detection rates among these study findings might be due to variation in numbers of viruses that were included in the viral panel of each study group. Our viral panel included ten common respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), influenza A and B viruses, human parainfluenza viruses type 1 to 3 (HPIV1, HPIV2, HPIV3), human metapneumo virus (HMPV), human bocavirus (HBoV), and adenovirus. However, the panel did not include coronavirus which may account for a certain percentage of infections. 31.5% specimens were positive for HRV, which was predominantly detected as a viral pathogen. However, the incidence rate of HRV was also higher in asymptomatic cases (23%). Interestingly, the detection rate of adenovirus was higher in asymptomatic cases (10%) than the symptomatic specimens (7%). A study conducted by Singleton et al. also frequently identified HRV and adenoviruses in healthy children [41] , which makes it difficult to make any inference regarding the association of these two viruses with respiratory illness. RSV was the second most prevalent virus identified in 31% cases. However, unlike HRV, RSV has been reported as a recurrent cause of ARI in both children younger than five years old and adult, with incidence reaching 26% (Laos PDR), 33% (Mexico), 35% (Niger), 37% (Brazil), 51% (Germany), 57% (India), and 76% (Spain) of the investigated cases [35, 37-40, 42, 43] . RSV can cause both upper and lower respiratory tract infections. After RSV, HMPV (13%), HBoV (11%) and HPIV-3 (10.5%) came out as the third, fourth, and fifth most prevalent viral agents. However, we observed relatively low pathogen detection rates for HPIV-1, HPIV-2, influenza A, and influenza B viruses. Thus after RSV, HMPV, HBoV, and HPIVs came out as the frequent causes of hospitalization of children with respiratory illness and the findings are consistent with other published data [24] . Approximately 70-89% cases of bronchiolitis had been reported to associate with RSV infection and 3-25% with parainfluenza viruses and there werek very few cases of bronchiolitis which could be attributed to human influenza virus and adenovirus [44, 45] . Several studies have described frequencies of 3.3-19% for HMPV infections in hospitalized children with respiratory tract infections [7, [44] [45] [46] [47] , although HMPV has been known to cause severe respiratory infections in the elderly [48, 49] . The frequency of HBoV identified in this study (11%) was also comparable with HBoV detection rates in Spain (9.9%) and Vietnam (7.2%) [50, 51] .

Age-dependent distribution of respiratory virus data of our study shows that viral infection is mostly concentrated in less than one-year age group particularly RSV as a substantial threat. The frequency of pathogen positive specimens and incidence of coinfections were significantly higher in under-one children, which makes it the most vulnerable age group for ARIs. Additionally, around 87% (54/62) of the RSV cases were detected in children less than one year of age. The frequency of RSV infections in this age group seems to be a consequence of multifactorial complex events, involving especially immunological factors. Maternal antibodies are a vital means of protection to infants against respiratory viruses as they have a relatively immature immune system to mount an effective immune response. RSV antibodies are found in all adults and children older than three years of age. At one year of age, 25-50% of children have antibodies against RSV, indicating the high frequency of this infection at a young age [52] and then the incidence of RSV infections decreases with age, probably because of the development of anti-RSV immunity which is boosted during each subsequent re-infection [53] . Currently, there are no effective antivirals or vaccines against RSV infections. Several RSV vaccines are being evaluated in clinical trials and have yet to be licensed [54] .

The study identified 35 cases with viral-bacterial mixed infections where RSV and S. pneumoniae were the predominant viral and bacterial partners, respectively, followed by HRV and K. pneumoniae duo. Each of HRV, RSV, S. pneumoniae, and K. pneumoniae showed a seasonal peak in September and both S. pneumoniae, and K. pneumoniae had significant participation in mixed infections demonstrating that viral infection renders bacterial colonization. Higher rates of bacterial infections by S. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae in synergy with RSV, HRV, and other viruses may indicate that predominant ARI viruses predispose their hosts to secondary infections by bacteria. The other major viral partners of bacterial mixed infections included HMPV and HPIV. The mechanisms by which viruses influence bacterial colonization and invasion are very diverse. It has been shown that viral infections may predispose to bacterial super-infections by favoring bacterial attachment sites on nasopharyngeal epithelial cells and through increased mucous production that promotes bacterial growth [55, 56] . The real clinical significance of these infections has not yet been fully elucidated. Under the circumstances, emphasis should be given on deciphering the role of bacterial mixed infections in promoting disease pathology. The presence of pathogens in asymptomatic children made the aspect more puzzling. However, a case control study hypothesized that there could have a subclinical infection in asymptomatic cases which may act as a pathogen transmission source [57] . It is also important to remember that the detection rate of mixed infection is dependent mostly on methodology and number of pathogens that are being screened. Despite differences in methodologies, the similarity in rates of hospitalized viral respiratory illness in different countries suggests that respiratory viruses indeed are important contributors of childhood hospitalization around the world.

There are several shortfalls of the study including (a) shorter study period, (b) low number of both symptomatic and asymptomatic specimens, (c) exclusion of coronavirus from viral panel selected for RT-qPCR assay, (d) lack of some clinical information and follow-up study, (e) use of nasal swabs instead of nasopharyngeal swabs for specimen collection, (f) exclusion of ARI-causing fungal pathogen detection. Thirty-five out of 200 specimens remained undetected of any viral or bacterial pathogens. It is highly likely that the inclusion of fungal pathogen detection system and the addition of coronavirus in the viral panel would increase the rate of pathogen detection to some extent. In addition, the detection rate of bacterial pathogens could have been higher if PCR or qPCR had been used instead of culture method as the former one has higher sensitivity. However, we wanted to isolate all types of possible organisms and the use of specific primers would have confined the range of organisms. For example, E. agglomerans which has been rarely reported as a causative agent of ARIs was isolated in 4 (2%) nasal swab specimens in this study. The nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) has been considered to be the best sampling technique, but the procedure of obtaining an NPA specimen is uncomfortable and often frightening for young children. It is also unpleasant for the medical staff, who have to carry out the procedure with a struggling, crying, and coughing child. However, pathogen detection sensitivity did not differ significantly between nasal swab and NPA approaches of specimen collection when sensitive real-time PCR method was used to detect pathogens [58, 59] . In the study, only those viruses that are frequently detected in Bangladesh were listed in the viral panel. Even with these limitations, the study provides important preliminary data that can be used for more focused surveys in a larger population. The frequency of viral infection should be taken into account by pediatricians to avoid the irrational use of antibiotics.

In summary, ARI incidence, as well as pathogen detection rates, were higher during postmonsoon and winter in Bangladesh. HRV and RSV were the predominant viral causative agents in under-five ARIs. On the other hand, S. pneumoniae came out as the most prevalent bacterial causative agent. Children aged less than one year of age were most susceptible to infections including coinfections. 

Supplementary Information Supplementary Text Material S1. Method section "Influenza-like" illness (ILI) study participants

study participants from the Stockholm (Sweden) area entered the baseline step of the ILI study in the context of the Swedish national LifeGene project 1 .

Participants were recruited mainly at work places (e.g. Biotech companies, Universities, Stockholm Public Transport), and during open-days at LifeGene centers where retirees and children were also invited to join in the study. The participants responded to a baseline web questionnaire addressing existing medical conditions, medication, previous seasonal flu vaccination, physical contact with other people, travelling patterns, physical activity and the intake of supplements. The study participants reported via a web questionnaire (flu event questionnaire) their flu-like symptoms (fever, headache, tiredness, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, diarrhoea, vomiting) during the 2009/2010 flu season, and responded to a follow-up web questionnaire (including pandemic flu vaccination status) in spring 2010. Serum and heparin blood samples were drawn at study entry and after the flu season in spring 2010. Prepaid envelopes and nasal swabs were also provided to the participants at study entry and they were invited to use them at the onset of ILI symptoms and send them back for analysis as described below. If the participant's swab was identified with any influenza RNA or corona virus DNA, a home visit (the mean time between the first swab and the home visit was 2,5 weeks) was performed to sample one nasal swab and a blood sample from the index study participant as well as from the household members after they agreed on an informed consent. The study was approved by the regional ethics review board (DN 2009(DN /1183 and each individual study participant provided informed consent.

Swedish residents who were offered the pandemic flu vaccine received Pandemrix (GSK)

vaccine containing A/ H1N1/California/7/2009 (adjuvanted with ASO3, i.e. DL-α-tocopherol, vitamin E; squalene and polysorbate).

All participants in the study were provided four Σ-VIROCULT swabs and transport media vials (MW950S, Medical Wire and Equipment, Wiltshire, England) during the first blood draw and instructions on how to use the nasal swab. If study participants experienced ILI symptoms, they took a nasal swab and posted the material which was tested for 22 viral targets (Supplementary Table S1) as described in detail 2 .

The swab samples received were blended in the transport medium by vortexing and 400µL of this blend was used to extract viral nucleic acid. Nucleic acid extraction was performed according to supplier's instructions on EZ1 Biorobot (Qiagen Inc. Hilden, Germany) using EZ1 Virus mini kit v2.0 (Qiagen Inc.) and final elution volume of 60µL.

Virus specific nucleic acid detection was performed using a multiplex kit from Beckman Coulter (Miami, USA) as described in detail 2 . This panel covered 11 different serotypes of Influenza virus and 11 viral serotypes among 6 viruses suspected to cause common upper respiratory tract infections (Supplementary Table S2 ). Target specific cDNA was synthesized using a reverse transcriptase primer plex kit and for the GenomeLab GeXP start kit (Beckman Coulter). Reverse transcription (RT) reaction was performed in 20µL reaction volume using 12µL of extracted nucleic acid, 4µL of GeXP 5X RT buffer, 2µL of RT primer plex and 1µL each of undiluted Kan-r and reverse transcriptase enzyme. The reaction was initiated at 48 o C for 1 minute followed by 42 o C for 60 minutes and terminated at 95 o C for 5 minutes; the synthesised cDNA was kept at 4 o C before using for PCR analysis. PCR reaction was performed in 20µL reaction volume using 9.3µL of synthesized cDNA, 4µL 5X PCR buffer, 4µL, 25mM MgCl 2 , 2µL PCR primer plex and 0.7µL of Thermo Start DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific Inc. Fullerton, CA, USA). The PCR reaction was initiated at 95 o C for 5 minutes followed by 40 cycles of 94 o C for 30 seconds, 55 o C for 30 seconds and 70 o C for 1 minute. The PCR product was maintained at 4 o C prior to fragment analysis.

Fragment analysis was performed on a GenomeLab GeXP fragment analysis system (Beckman Coulter Inc.) 1µL of PCR product was dissolved in 39µL of sample loading solution and 400 bp DNA ladder was used as size reference. The Kan-r PCR fragment and RP DNA along with RP RNA PCR fragment were used as reaction control and sample control respectively. If control bands were absent, the analysis was repeated to rule out procedural errors. Viral target identification was performed using GenomeLab GexP fragment analysis software.

Once control bands were identified, the sample was subjected to further analysis based on the virusspecific size of the amplicon. In case of influenza A H1N1 09 ('swine flu') serotype, in addition to human housekeeping gene control fragments, the presence of the influenza A generic PCR fragment as well as the H1N1 general signal was required to mark a sample as positive for H1N1 RNA. The detected 'swine flu' positive samples were subjected to sequencing by cloning and subsequent sequencing for matrix (GU322021.1, NCBI), neuraminidase (GU361110.1, NCBI) and hemagglutinin (GU727573.1, NCBI) genes to confirm viral diagnosis.

Stimulation with a class A CpG oligonucleotide enhances resistance to infection with feline viruses from five different families

Domestic cats are commonly affected by viral pathogens that induce lengthy infections with fatal outcomes. Prevention of viral propagation is of primordial importance in shelters and catteries, where cats from different backgrounds have narrow contacts. Oligonucleotides (ODN) containing cytosine-phosphate-guanosine motifs of class A (CpG-A) are highly potent synthetic inducers of innate antiviral mechanisms. The aim of this study was to test their ability to modulate innate immune responses and prevent viral replication as stand-alone agents in the domestic cat. CpG-A stimulation of feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) enhanced their proliferation, increased the presence of co-stimulatory molecules on their surface and influenced their gene expression profiles in an antiviral orientation. Incubation of the supernatants of CpG-A stimulated PBMCs with feline cell lines of epithelial and fibroblastic origin induced expression of the antiviral myxovirus resistance (Mx) gene in these target cells, which also showed enhanced resistance to feline viruses from five distinct families, namely Coronaviridae, Herpesviridae, Caliciviridae, Parvoviridae, and Retroviridae. Most importantly, subcutaneous administration of CpG-A in domestic cats systemically increased the expression of Mx, reaching maximal levels within 24 h. Plasma from treated cats could furthermore inhibit viral replication in vitro. Altogether, our data highlight the promising potential of CpG-A to induce a preventive antiviral state in the cat and to protect feline populations against a broad range of virus infections.

Feline viruses are of particularly opportunistic character. In order to adapt to the solitary way of life of ancestral felids, these pathogens have acquired elaborate means to persist within their host population over the course of time. The infection of new hosts upon the rare contact between individuals was evolutionarily assured by very efficient transmission strategies and the induction of latent, chronic and/or asymptomatic infections. Often kept in multi-cat households and placed in catteries or shelters, today's domestic cat is consequently particularly susceptible to viral infections [1, 2] . The close proximity and high social contact rate of animals with different vaccination states in these stressful environments further increases the risk of infection. Moreover, the strong antigenic variability of several common feline viruses including the feline calicivirus (FCV), the feline coronavirus (FCoV) and the feline leukemia virus (FeLV) support escape from immune responses and lower the efficacy of currently available vaccines [3] . The availability of complementary prophylactic strategies could help protect pet cats in environments with high infectious pressure from long diseases and/or death caused by infections with fatal viruses.

A promising addition to vaccination is the manipulation of innate immunity. Innate pathogen recognition relies on a set of sensory molecules, the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which enable the immediate reaction of specific immune cells to pathogen "danger signals", the so-called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [4] . Due to their abundance in all bacterial as well as some viral genomes, oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) containing unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) motifs are effectively recognized as PAMPs by the vertebrate innate immune system [5] . Response to CpG ODN stimulation is conferred through TLR9, expressed mainly in the intracellular compartments of human B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) [6, 7] . Alarmed TLR9 is the initial instigator of gene expression profiles that strongly support antiviral mechanisms: upregulation of costimulatory molecules major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II, B7.1 and B7.2 on the surface of stimulated cells provides them with a stronger antigen presenting potential [8, 9] and production of cytokines such as type I interferon (IFN), interleukin (IL)-12, IFNγ, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, contribute to providing an optimal immune environment for the development of innate and adaptive responses against intracellular pathogens [10, 11] . Probably the most important antiviral property of CpG ODN resides in their potential to stimulate the production of high amounts of type I IFN by pDCs [12] . This family of cytokines, which includes IFNα, IFNω and IFNβ, has been shown to considerably enhance natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity [13] , promote differentiation, maturation and immunostimulatory functions of monocytes and DCs [14] , induce B cell production of immunoglobulin [15] and T-helper (Th) 1 differentiation of T cells [16, 17] . Moreover, upon binding to their ubiquitously distributed receptor, type I IFNs effectively induce the synthesis of various intracellular proteins which interfere with the replication of a broad range of viruses [18] . The myxovirusresistance protein (Mx) GTPase is a well-studied example of these intracellular antiviral effectors. This enzyme is known to be directly regulated by the type I IFN, and its detection is readily used as marker for upregulation and biological activity of this cytokine family [19] .

Distinct classes of ODN have been shown to induce differential immune responses [20] . Class A CpG ODN (CpG-A) consist of CpG motifs in a phosphodiester core, flanked on both ends by phosphorothioate poly (G) sequences. CpG ODN of this class are characterized by their potential to both induce massive type I IFN secretion by pDCs [12] and increase NK cytotoxicity [21] , rendering them ideal candidates as prophylactic enhancers of innate immunity to viral infections. Conversely, class B CpG ODN (CpG-B), which encode multiple CpG motifs on a phosphorothioate backbone, promote monocyte maturation and B cell activation, thus substantially supporting the development of humoral immune responses [22] [23] [24] . Both CpG-A and CpG-B have indicated immunostimulatory properties in immune cells of mice, primates and many domestic species in vitro [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] , while in vivo studies in outbred animals have mainly been carried out with CpG-B [24, 32, 33] . Concerning the cat, specifically synthesized CpG-A molecules were recently shown to induce IFNγ [34] ; CpG-B molecules indicated the capability to induce proliferation of feline cells [35] , and CpG-B-adjuvanted allergen indicated potential for immunotherapy in a feline asthma model [36] . Although class C [37, 38] and class P ODN [39] were developed in more recent years in an effort to combine the advantageous effects of both CpG-A and CpG-B and increase immunogenicity, CpG-A remain the strongest inducers of type I IFN described to date.

The potential of CpG ODN as prophylactic standalone inducers of innate defense mechanisms has been the subject of only few studies. Most works in this field initially described protection of mice against bacterial [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] and parasitic [45] [46] [47] infections. More recently, induction of resistance to viral infections was shown also in mouse models for Herpes Simplex Virus [48] , neurotropic arenavirus [49] , foot and mouth disease virus [50] and Vaccinia virus [51] . With exception of the latter, all these studies were carried out with CpG-B. In an outbred species, partial antiviral protection has only been described in two studies so far, in which reduced shedding of herpes and parainfluenza viruses was observed in lambs after administration also of a CpG-B [52, 53] . To our knowledge, prophylactic antiviral potential of CpG-A has not yet been described in outbred animals.

We carried out a series of experiments with the objective to characterize both the immunomodulatory and antiviral properties of CpG-A in the domestic cat. In vitro, the prototype of CpG-A, ODN 2216 [12] , strengthened the antiviral qualities of feline immune cells and stimulated their production of soluble molecules that inhibited the replication of five different families of viruses: Coronaviridae, Herpesviridae, Caliciviridae, Parvoviridae, and Retroviridae. In vivo, ODN 2216 induced a systemic antiviral state.

Fourteen male castrated SPF cats divided in four different age groups were used in this study: group 1 (c01-c04, 10 weeks), group 2 (c05-c08, 1.5 years), group 3 (c09-c12, 7 years) and group 4 (c13 and c14, 14 years). Cats c13 and c14 from group 4 originated from the same litter; all other individuals were not related to each other. The in vivo experiments were conducted when cats c05-c08 were 3 years of age. All animals were purchased from Liberty Research Inc. (Waverly, NY, USA) and their SPF status was verified as previously described [54] . This study was carried out in strict accordance with regulations of the Swiss law for animal protection (SR 445.1). The Veterinary Office of the Swiss Canton of Zurich officially revised the protocol and approved the study (Permit no. TVB 99/2007 and TVB 100/2007). The animals were housed in groups in an animalfriendly barrier facility under optimal ethological conditions [55] . For blood collections and injections, the cats were sedated with a combination of ketamin and midazolam, and all possible efforts were made to minimize stress and suffering.

Feline PBMC isolation, cell lines, ODNs, cell culture and cell viability assay Feline PBMCs were isolated from EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation using a standard protocol [56] . Purified cells were counted prior to their utilization in the different experiments using the Sysmex XT 2000iV (Sysmex, Norderstedt, Germany) as described previously [57] , and cultured in RPMI 1640 with Glutamax I (Gibco ® , Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland). Adherent CRFK (ATCC no. CCL-94) and FEA cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with Glutamax I, while adherent fcwf-4 cells (ATCC no. CRL-2787) were cultured in EMEM (ATCC 

PBMCs were seeded immediately after isolation at a concentration of 3 × 10 6 cells/mL in 96-well U-bottom plates. Triplicate cultures for each cat were treated with either 4 μg/mL ODN 2216 or 2243 or an equal volume of endotoxin-free PBS. After an initial incubation of 18 h, the cells were pulsed for 24 h with 3 H-thymidine (Perkin Elmer, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland). Standard liquid scintillation protocols were used for harvesting of the cells and uptake of 3 H was assessed with the Packard Tri-Carb 1600TR liquid scintillation analyzer (Perkin Elmer). Proliferation rates were calculated as the mean counts per minute (c.p.m) of triplicate cultures. The stimulation index (SI) depicted in Figure 1 was calculated as follows:

Mean c:p:m:of ODN À treated cultures Mean c:p:m of PBS À treated cultures

PBMCs were treated at a density of 3 × 10 6 cells/mL with 4 μg/mL ODN 2216 or ODN 2243 or an equivalent volume of endotoxin-free PBS and cultured for 24 h in a 12-well format. During collection of the cells, the adherent cell fraction was removed with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Gibco ® , Invitrogen). Harvested cells were divided into 3 fractions labeled separately with either anti-feline B7.1 mouse monoclonal IgG (kindly provided by Prof Mary Tompkins, Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting Laboratory, NC State College of Veterinary Medicine, USA), anti-feline MHCII mouse monoclonal IgG1 (Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, Davis, USA) or fluoresceinisothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated mouse IgG1 as isotype control (BD Bioscience, Allschwil, Swizerland). The fractions were subsequently stained with R-Phycoerythrin (RPE)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 (BioConcept, Allschwil, Swizerland). Fluorescence data was obtained using the FACSCalibur ® instrument (Becton Dickinson, Allschwil, Switzerland) and the CellQuestPro™ software. Gates representing lymphocyte and non-lymphocyte populations were set on the basis of forward versus side scatter, and a total of 50 000 events were acquired in the nonlymphocyte gate. Data was analyzed with the FlowJo software (Tree Star, Olten, Switzerland), whereby an additional gate was set comprising both lymphocyte and non-lymphocyte populations (PBMC gate). MHCII and B7.1 expression levels were determined as mean of fluorescence intensity for each gated cell population. Identical gates were set for all cats in such a way that they comprise the desired cell populations of each animal.

PBMCs were stimulated with ODN 2216, ODN 2243 or endotoxin-free PBS at a density of 3 × 10 6 cells/mL directly after isolation, while CrFK, FEA or fcwf-4 cells were cultured to confluency prior to stimulation. Experiments were carried out in a 96-well format. For stimulation of adherent cells with supernatants (production see below), total cell culture medium was discarded from the wells and the monolayers were further cultured in 100 μL undiluted supernatants for the rest of the experiment. At time points relevant to each experiment, the supernatants were removed and cells were lysed with mRNA lysis buffer (mRNA isolation kit I, Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). mRNA extractions were performed with the mRNA Isolation Kit I and MagNA Pure LC Instrument (Roche Diagnostics) and first strand cDNA was synthesized with the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions consisted of 5 μL cDNA in a total volume of 25 μL per reaction using the TaqMan ® Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Thermocycling conditions included an initial denaturation of 20 s at 95°C followed by 45 cycles of amplification by melting at 95°C for 3 s and annealing at 60°C for 45 s. Primers and probes for feline genes have been previously described [58] . mRNA expression factors of selected genes, which correspond to ratios of mRNA levels measured in ODN 2216 or ODN 2243 stimulated versus PBS stimulated cells, were calculated and normalized with GeNorm version 3.5 [59] , using either both feline β-glucuronidase (GUSB) and tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein zeta polypeptide (YWHAZ) (usually) or Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) alone (when specified) as reference genes, under conditions validated for the feline species [60] . Generally depicted in the graphs are mean expression factors calculated from duplicate experiments carried out simultaneously. Where results of one cat are illustrated, experiments were conducted with cells of at least 3 individual animals and representative data is shown.

For each cat, PBMCs were resuspended in supplemented RPMI 1640 with Glutamax I (Gibco ® , Invitrogen) at a concentration of 10 6 cells/mL in 6-well plates and stimulated immediately after isolation with 4 μg/mL ODN 2216, 4 μg/mL ODN 2243 or an equivalent volume of endotoxin-free PBS. After 24 h incubation , supernatants were harvested by centrifugation of the cultures twice at 2000 × g for 10 min, aliquoted and stored at −20°C. Large supernatant quantities were produced with PBMCs purified after one blood collection, enabling the utilization of the same supernatants for virus inhibition experiments concerning VSV, FCV, FCoV, FHV and FPV. New supernatant batches were produced for use in FeLV inhibition assays. Supernatants derived from PBMCs stimulated with ODN 2216, ODN 2243 and endotoxin-free PBS are referred to as Sup2216, Sup 2243 and Sup Neg in the text and in the figures.

CrFK and fcwf-4 grown to confluency in 12-well plates were stimulated with 600 μL of PBMC supernatants produced as explained above. At the time points indicated, cells were harvested and counted. 10 6 cells of either cell line were resuspended in 30 μL sample buffer (0.5 M Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, 5% SDS, 10% βmercaptoethanol, 40% glycerol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue) and boiled at 95°C for 5 min. SDS-PAGE separation and submersed immunoblotting procedures were carried out as previously described [61] . The Spectra Multicolor Broad Range Protein Ladder (Fermentas GmbH, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) served as molecular weight standard marker for each blot. For protein visualization, membranes were first cut immediately below the 80kB marker band. The top and bottom membrane fractions were incubated with murine anti-human Mx MAb M143 (generously provided by Dr J. Pavlovic, Institute for Virology, University of Zürich, Switzerland) and murine anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody as a loading control (Sigma Aldrich GMbH, Buchs, Switzerland) respectively. Both fractions were subsequently incubated with a peroxidase-labelled goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, Newmarket, Suffolk, UK). Bands were digitalized using the Chemigenius 2 BioImaging System (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). With the exception of assays carried out with FPV, viral inhibition experiments were conducted simultaneously and with supernatants thawed an equal number of times. The treated cells were then inoculated with virus (VSV, FCV, FHV, FCoV) or trypsinized with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Gibco ® , Invitrogen) and allowed to settle in viral suspension (FPV), and inhibition assays were carried out after 24 h (72 h for FCoV and FPV) according to the procedure described previously [62] . Briefly, supernatants were discarded and cell debris was removed from the wells by 3 cycles of washing with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Gibco, Invitrogen) and shaking on an orbital shaker for 15 s. Remaining cells were fixed with 5% formalin and stained with a crystal violet solution. For spectrophotometric measurements, 100% methanol was added to the dried out wells and absorbance was read at 595 nm on a SpectraMax Plus 384 microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Bucher Biotec AG, Basel, Switzerland). Viral inhibition rates were calculated with the following formula:

Mean optical density OD ð Þvalues of duplicate wells treated with Supernatant Mean OD values of quadruplicate wells treated with medium alone FeLV-A Glasgow-1 strain (a generous gift from Prof. M. Hosie and O. Jarret, University of Glasgow, Great Britain) was titrated on FEA cells, and the lowest stock dilution leading to productive infection of the cells after 48 h was used for inhibition assays. Experiments were carried out in 96-well plates and cells were treated with 100 μL of supernatants or relevant controls immediately prior to inoculation. Every second day thereafter, 50 μL culture medium was replaced by the same volume of fresh supernatant. At appropriate time points, cells and supernatants were harvested and total nucleic acid was extracted from both the cells and supernatants using the MagNA Pure LC DNA Isolation Kit I and MagNA Pure LC Instrument (Roche Diagnostics). Viral replication in supernatants and proviral loads in cells were measured by real-time RT-PCR and real-time PCR respectively, with assays previously described [63] . The time course experiments were conducted with supernatants derived from PBMCs of three cats and the measurements on day 8 post inoculation were carried out with material derived from two additional cats. In order to facilitate interpretation of the figures illustrating measurements of viral RNA loads, 45 cycles-cycle threshold (Ct) values were calculated and means of duplicate wells are depicted.

Cats c05 and c06 were administered ODN 2216 once subcutaneously at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg body weight while cats c07 and c08 received endotoxin-free PBS as control. The treatments were distributed in equal portions bilaterally in axillary and inguinal regions. Heparinized blood was collected at time points 0 h (just before injection of the treatment), 8 h, 24 h, 48 h, 96 h and 192 h. The cats were clinically examined and body temperature was measured at each time point. Whole blood samples were used in part for the assessment of hematological paramaters with the Sysmex XT 2000iV (Sysmex, Norderstedt, Germany) as previously described [57] . The rest of the blood was mixed with mRNA lysis buffer (Roche Diagnostics) immediately upon blood collection and processed as recommended by the manufacturer. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation of whole blood samples for 10 min at 1500 × g and conserved at −80°C until use for in vitro experiments. Mx mRNA expression was measured by qPCR and normalized to the expression of two feline housekeeping genes as described above. The expression factors depicted in the figures represent the ratio of mRNA levels from a specific time point to mRNA levels from time point 0 h. For viral inhibition assays, the plasma collected from each cat at each time point was incubated for 24 h with fcwf-4 cells prior to their inoculation with FCV. The assays were carried out as described above and viral inhibition factors were calculated as follows:

All statistical analyzes were performed using GraphPad Prism for Windows, version 3.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA). Due to the limited number of cats integrated in the study, we refrained from using a parametric approach in the statistical tests. As such tests require a larger sample size than n = 4, it was not possible to calculate p-values for the induction in expression of each gene shown in Figure 2 . Differences between treatment groups in proliferation of PBMCs were analyzed with a Mann-Whitney test and expression of costimulatory molecules on the surface of these cells were analyzed with a Wilcoxon signed rank test, where values for each cat were paired. Relative Mx mRNA expression, OD values from viral inhibition assays, ratios for FeLV provirus and Ct values for FeLV viral RNA loads were analyzed with a Wilcoxon signed rank test with pairing of values for each cat when treatment with different supernatants were compared, or a Mann-Whitney test when incubation with supernatant was opposed to treatment with medium alone or rfeIFNα. Normalized and relative TLR9 mRNA expression ratios between different animal age groups were also compared with a Mann-Whitney test. Longitudinal effects on FeLV viral and proviral loads were compared with each other using a Mann-Whitney test carried out with Area Under the Curve (AUC) values. Correlations were assessed using the Spearman test. p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Prototype CpG-A, ODN 2216, induce proliferation of primary feline immune cells and enhance their expression of costimulatory surface molecules Proliferation of PBMCs in response to treatment with CpG ODN gives strong indications about the biological activity of the stimulatory molecule and has been used to screen ODN in many species [25] . In relation to this, the potential of CpG-A to induce proliferation of feline PBMCs were assessed by measurement of 3 H-thymidine incorporation after stimulation. Although considerable variability was observed between individuals, a 2-fold increase in proliferation was observed after stimulation with ODN 2216 when compared to stimulation with inactive control ODN 2243 (p = 0.0281, Figure 1A ). The cells of three cats (c08, c09, c12) could be stimulated to particularly high proliferative rates by ODN 2216 (values above the mean of eight cats illustrated in Figure 1A ) in the following order: c08 > c12 > c09.

Another characteristic feature of stimulatory ODN is their ability to enhance interactions between various immune cell populations by upregulation of cell surface costimulatory molecules. With the objective to test whether ODN 2216 could exert such properties in feline immune cells, the expression of B7.1 and MHCII was measured by flow cytometry in stimulated PBMCs of the same eight cats as above. The expression of both co-stimulatory molecules was evaluated in gates defined to contain a PBMC population, a lymphocyte population and a non-lymphocyte population of cells. The observed effects varied considerably between the cells of individual cats, ranging from no alterations to an increase of 400% stained cells in some cellular subpopulations after ODN 2216 stimulation. Also, in some animals, stimulation with the control ODN 2243 indicated similar staining patterns as PBS, whereas in other cats the induction of effects comparable to those of ODN 2216 could be observed. The response of cells originating from a particular cat to stimulation with ODN 2243 did not however correlate with the influence of ODN 2216 on the expression of either surface molecule on these same cells. Overall, an increased expression of both B7.1 and MHCII was measured in gated PBMCs upon a 24 h stimulation with ODN 2216 when overlaid with the expression of these molecules after ODN 2243 or PBS stimulation ( Figure 1B and C) . Considering all eight cats, lymphocytic cells expressed significantly higher levels of B7.1 and MHCII when exposed to ODN 2216 than after treatment with PBS (p = 0.0195 and p = 0.039 respectively, Figure 1D and F). Feline MHCII expression on lymphocytes also seemed to be affected by ODN 2216 and ODN 2243 in a similar manner ( Figure 1F ). For nonlymphocytic cells, ODN 2216 more specifically affected the expression of B7.1 molecules, inducing significant upregulation of surface levels of this molecule when compared to stimulation with ODN 2243 (p = 0.0391) and PBS (p = 0.0039) for 24 h ( Figure 1E ). In contrast, the expression of MHCII was not significantly altered in cells gated as non-lymphocytes at this time point after stimulation ( Figure 1G ). Finally, the cells of the three cats (c08, c09 and c12) that exhibited the highest proliferation rates in response to ODN 2216 ( Figure 1A ) also indicated the strongest increase in expression of both cell surface molecules in all cellular subpopulations tested.

Through interaction with the TLR9, CpG-A typically induce expression of both type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokines in stimulated cells [12] . In order to understand whether ODN 2216 exert similar effects in the cat, treated cultures of feline PBMCs, FEA, CrFK and fcwf-4 cells were systematically screened for increased mRNA expression of IFNα and IL-6 following stimulation. Although all tested immortalized feline cell lines expressed TLR9 mRNA (data not shown), they failed to respond to stimulation with ODN 2216 ( Figure 3A and B and data not shown). However, this molecule exhibited potent immunomodulatory properties in feline PBMCs: when measured 24 h post stimulation, a concentration of only 1 μg/mL ODN 2216 was sufficient to enhance transcription of IFNα by 40-fold, and a maximum induction of this gene was observed when 4 μg/mL ODN were used ( Figure 3C ). Although affected in a similar pattern, the mRNA expression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 remained comparatively low at all concentrations tested ( Figure 3D ). In experiments foreseen to determine gene expression kinetics in feline cells after stimulation with the ODN 2216 molecule, an influence on IFNα transcription could be measured as early as 3 h after treatment of PBMCs, whereas increased levels of IL-6 mRNA were observed only as of 6 h post stimulation ( Figure 3E and F). Notably, the highest induction of both genes was measured 24 h after addition of ODN 2216 to the cultures, with transcription increasing by 9000-fold and 39fold at this time point for IFNα and IL-6 respectively ( Figure 3E and F). The observed effects were specifically conferred by the CpG motifs comprised in the 2216 ODN, since specific control ODN 2243 only induced slight elevations in the expression of the genes tested ( Figure 3C-F) . Importantly, trypan blue exclusion experiments indicated no evidence of cellular toxicity after treatment neither with ODN 2216 nor with ODN 2243 at all concentrations tested (data not shown).

In an effort to assess both the breadth of the effects conferred by treatment with a CpG-A and possible variability in the responses obtained in individual cats, the mRNA expression of ten genes relevant to early immune responses was measured in ODN 2216 stimulated PBMCs of fourteen cats divided in four different age groups (group 1: 10 weeks (n = 4), group 2: 1.5 years (n = 4), group 3: 7 years (n = 4), group 4: 14 years (n = 2)). Only slight individual variability in gene induction was observed after 24 h stimulation of immune cells from adult cats ranging between 1.5 and 14 years of age ( Figure 2B-D) . Overall, the mRNA expression profile Figure 2D ). Moreover, all individual IFNα subtypes tested were induced at similar levels in the cells of four adult cats from group 2 ( Figure 2E ). Increased levels of proinflammatory cytokine mRNA were also measured in most individuals of groups 2-4, with IL-6 more systematically increased than TNFα. The cells from these cats indicated a typical Th1 orientation after stimulation, with enhanced transcription of IL-12 in 9/ 10 and IFNγ in 6/10 animals, together with absent or only low induction of IL-4. Stimulation of PBMCs with ODN 2216 also created an optimal environment for NK cell activity, as indicated by the increases in mRNA expression of the NK cell stimulator IL-15 by up to 20-fold and of the NK cell effector Granzyme B by up to 7-fold. The cells of those cats (c08, c09, c12) that had most effectively proliferated ( Figure 1A ) and/or exhibited the strongest expression of co-stimulatory molecules ( Figure 1B-E) following ODN 2216 stimulation also consistently expressed the highest mRNA levels of IFNα, IFNω, IL-6, Il-12, IL-15 and Granzyme B. PBMCs of cat c08 (group 2, Figure 1B) were also by far most responsive to stimulation with ODN 2216. When cells from kittens of group 1 were stimulated, higher individual variability was observed than in adult animals ( Figure 2A ). The PBMCs of only 2 out of 4 cats from this group could be stimulated with ODN 2216 to increase mRNA expression of the tested genes. In both individuals, not only the mRNA expression of type I IFN genes was enhanced at much lower levels than observed in adult cats but the overall immune response favored a Th2 direction, characterized by upregulated IL-4 and downregulated IL-12 mRNA levels ( Figure 2A) .

In order to determine whether a discrepancy in expression of TLR9 between the PBMCs of adult animals and kittens could play a role in these observations, mRNA levels of this gene were measured in immune cells of each cat. Although basal TLR9 expression was similar in the PBMCs of the cats of all age groups ( Figure 2F ), ODN 2216 stimulation increased TLR9 transcription in the cells of kittens, but decreased transcription of this gene in the cells of adult cats so that differences in the mRNA levels of this receptor were significantly higher in young cats (group 1) than in adult cats of groups 2 and 3 (p = 0.0286) ( Figure 2G ).

Protective properties of type I IFN against viruses originate from their ability to trigger the production of potent antiviral proteins in nearby cells. The expression of one of these antiviral proteins, the Mx GTPase, is known to be directly stimulated by type I IFN and can be used as marker for the induction of intracellular antiviral mechanisms by these cytokines in cats as well as in other species [19, 64] . Thus, as detection of feline type I IFN on a protein level is rendered difficult by the unavailability of antibodies specifically recognizing these proteins, mRNA levels of Mx were measured in feline PBMCs after stimulation with ODN 2216, as indication for production of type I IFN. Transcription of Mx was significantly enhanced and remained proportional to mRNA expression of type I IFN in stimulated PBMCs of individual cats ( Figure 4A 

Felids are frequently affected by four viruses of different families: the feline herpesvirus (FHV), calicivirus (FCV), parvovirus (FPV) and coronavirus (FCoV). Although these viruses cannot productively infect purified PBMCs in vitro, they share the ability to induce cytopathic effects (CPE) in CrFK and fcwf-4 cells. These feline cell lines, however, do not alter their mRNA levels of genes selected as markers for innate immunity upon direct treatment with ODN 2216 ( Figure 3A and B and data not shown), preventing from assessing the potential of this molecule to inhibit viral replication directly in these cells. Thus, CrFK and fcwf-4 cells were incubated, prior to their inoculation, with the cell-free supernatants of PBMCs mentioned above: Sup 2216, Sup 2243 and Sup Neg. To this aim, supernatants derived from PBMCs treated for 24 h were selected, as Sup 2216 produced by the cells of several adult cats were estimated to contain optimal type I IFN amounts at this time point, according to the induction of Mx transcription measured directly in these immune cells ( Figure 4A and 4B ). CrFK and fcwf-4 target cells were then incubated with the supernatants for 24 h before inoculation, as this time span had indicated highest induction of antiviral mechanisms ( Figure 4F ). The antiviral effects of the supernatants were initially tested on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) as control, as this virus is widely recognized for both its potential to induce CPE in cell lines of multiple species and for its particularly high sensitivity to the effects of type I IFN [65, 66] . When the Sup 2216 derived from the PBMCs of eight adult cats that had broadly responded to in vitro ODN 2216 stimulation ( Figure 2B and C, groups 2 and 3) were incubated with fcwf-4 cells prior to their inoculation, significant inhibition of VSV replication was observed (p = 0.0039) ( Figure 5A ). The replication of this virus was also to some degree repressed by Sup 2243 (p = 0.0078), an observation Table 1 ). Both Sup 2243 and Sup Neg failed to inhibit replication of this heterogeneous group of feline viruses, underlining the essential role of the 2216 molecule in conferring the observed effects. Importantly, cells stimulated with ODN 2216 directly did not indicate any resistance to viral replication, in concordance to their impaired response to this molecule already measured on a genetic level ( Figure 3A and B and data not shown). With respect to the younger cats, the Sup 2216 of those 2 kittens whose cells responded to ODN 2216 stimulation (Figure 2A , group 1) could also inhibit both VSV and FCV on fcwf-4 cells, while the supernatants derived from the PBMCs of the other 2 kittens indicated no inhibition potential on these viruses ( Figure 5K and L). Altogether, the viral suppression potential of Sup 2216 from all the cats could be compared to that conferred by treatment of the cells with 10 to 100U rfeIFNα, a quantity determined in titration experiments of rfeIFNα conducted together with the viral inhibition assays (data not shown).

The differential inhibition of the viruses tested by the same supernatants is reflected by the distinct viral inhibition ratios observed ( Figure 5B -E and Table 1 ). Sensitivity of each virus to rfeIFNα correlated with sensitivity to the Sup 2216 and induction of Mx in target cells by the supernatants highly correlated with the inhibition of all viruses ( Figure 5F-I) . Finally, Sup 2216 derived from PBMCs of cats c08, whose cells had indicated strong responsiveness to stimulation with ODN 2216 in previous experiments, most efficiently inhibited the replication of all viruses.

Similar results were notably obtained when the supernatants of PBMCs derived from all cats were incubated with CrFK cells prior to their inoculation with all the above-mentioned viruses (data not shown). This cell line has previously indicated less sensitivity to the antiviral effects of type I IFN [66] and generally 10-fold higher amounts of rfeIFNα were found in titration experiments to be required for the inhibition of all five viruses. Concordantly, average fold viral inhibition in CrFK cells by the Sup 2216 was approximately half that observed in fcwf-4 cells.

The life cycle of retroviruses is characterized by the reverse transcription of their genomic RNA into DNA and subsequent integration of this viral DNA as provirus into the genome of the host, causing permanent infection most often accompanied by persistent virus production by infected cells. The feline leukemia virus (FeLV), a gammaretrovirus that can be propagated on FEA cells in vitro, affects domestic cats worldwide. As viral replication in chronically infected cats can be lowered by treatment with IFNα [67] , the potential of Sup 2216 produced by the PBMCs of five adult cats (c06 and c08 from group 2; c09, c10, c12 from group 3) to inhibit productive infection of FEA cells was analyzed. In initial experiments, this cell line exhibited similar responses as fcwf-4 and CrFK cells to both direct treatment with ODN 2216 and incubation with the different supernatants ( Figure 3A , 4C and D and data not shown). Compared to incubation with medium alone, treatment of FEA cells with Sup 2216 for 24 h prior to inoculation with FeLV followed by repetitive treatments of the cells with this supernatant every 2 days thereafter significantly reduced viral RNA (p < 0.05) and DNA (p < 0.05) Figure 6A and B). The antiviral potential of the supernatants from the individual cats was very similar; however the best results were conferred by the Sup 2216 derived from cells of c08 (depicted in Figure 6A and B).The kinetic curve of viral RNA loads in cultures of cells treated with Sup 2216 of this cat was similar to those obtained in cells treated with 50U rfeIFNα (data not shown). Also, treatment of the cells with ODN 2216 directly affected neither viral RNA nor viral DNA loads measured in the supernatants and the cells respectively (data not shown). Mx mRNA expression was 80-fold higher in the Sup 2216 treated cells than in all controls 8 days post inoculation, indicating the ability of these supernatants to sustain antiviral mechanisms when applied to the cells repeatedly ( Figure 6C ). Furthermore at this time point, the Sup 2216 treated cells exhibited significantly lower viral DNA loads (p = 0.0313) and produced significantly less virus (p = 0.0313) than cells treated with Sup 2243, Sup Neg or medium alone ( Figure 6D and E). The extent of Mx transcription conferred by the Sup 2216 of the cats strongly correlated with lower provirus (p = 0.0053) and virus (p = 0.0012) loads measured in the FEA cells and supernatants respectively on day 8 post inoculation (p = 0.0053). Also, the highest Mx mRNA levels in target cells were conferred by Sup 2216 of cat c08 and reflected by the lowest viral and proviral loads measured at this time point in our experiments.

In a final step, the induction of antiviral responses by ODN 2216 was measured in vivo and characterized using ex vivo assays. The molecule was administered once subcutaneously to two cats (c07 and c08), while two other cats (c05 and c06) received endotoxin-free PBS as a negative control. The injections were well tolerated by all cats: no rise in body temperature, no local reactions at the injection site and no other undesired side effects were noted. Absolute monocyte counts increased 1.5 to 2-fold in the first 12 h in cats that had received ODN 2216 (data not shown). No other treatment-specific alterations were noted in hematological values throughout the experiment. Mx expression was measured in blood at early time points after injection as marker for the induction of antiviral immune processes. mRNA levels of Mx increased by 8.8 and 3.8-fold within 24 h in both treated cats and decreased gradually thereafter until 192 h post treatment ( Figure 7A ). In accordance with observations from in vitro experiments, cat c08 exhibited a stronger response to ODN 2216 than cat c07. No increase in Mx expression was observed in the blood of the control cats (c05 and c06). In a further experiment, plasma was collected from all four cats at regular intervals post injection and was utilized in an in vitro inhibition assay. The plasma obtained from both treated cats 24 and 48 h after administration of the molecule was able to inhibit replication of FCV in vitro ( Figure 7B ). In contrast, plasma from untreated cats seemed to slightly enhance the susceptibility of target cells to FCV inoculation.

In the present study, we conducted both in vitro and in vivo experiments that characterize immunomodulatory and antiviral effects of a CpG-A molecule in the domestic cat. We show that ODN 2216, the first described CpG-A [12] , can upregulate the expression of a series of genes in feline immune cells that play important roles in early responses to viruses. Soluble molecules produced by feline PBMCs upon ODN 2216 stimulation significantly increased resistance of various feline target cell lines to propagation of viruses from five different families, namely FCV, FPV, FHV, FCoV and FeLV. The observed repression of viral replication highly correlated with the mRNA expression of type I IFN genes in stimulated PBMCs as well as the induction, prior to inoculation, of antiviral mechanisms in the target cells. Furthermore, a single administration of ODN 2216 significantly increased the expression of Mx in the blood of treated cats. Plasma from these animals could also inhibit replication of FCV in vitro. Our data underline the prophylactic potential of ODN 2216 in an outbred species as a stand-alone agent and against a large range of viral pathogens simultaneously. Cats may highly benefit from such a molecule when placed in environments with strong infectious pressure such as catteries, shelters or pet shows.

Cells of the feline immune system were strongly influenced when cultured in the presence of ODN 2216. First, feline PBMCs significantly proliferated in presence of ODN 2216, indicating a direct and /or indirect stimulation of one or more immune cell subpopulations by this molecule. Although in contrast to other classes of ODN CpG-A does not generally induce lymphocyte proliferation in mice [12] , similar effects have previously been observed in ovine cells, where higher concentrations of CpG-A could induce minimal levels of proliferation [68] . Additionally, ODN 2216 increased the expression of cell surface co-stimulatory molecules in PBMCs, reinforcing possible interactions between various immune cell populations in subsequent specific responses. While B7.1 molecules were upregulated on both lymphocytic and non-lymphocytic cells after ODN 2216 stimulation, MHCII expression could only be increased on lymphocytic cells. This observation may be linked to the time point of our measurements, or to the necessity of transport to the cell surface of MHCII molecules coupled with antigen for presentation to other immune cells. Finally, the transcription of a series of markers of innate immune responses was considerably influenced in feline PBMCs by stimulation with ODN 2216. The most astonishing effects of this molecule thereby remain the potent induction of IFNα and IFNω, with mRNA expression of these genes increased by up to 12 000 and 35 000-fold respectively in PBMCs of certain animals. In line with observations published recently, the induction of IFNγ by this CpG ODN remained moderate [34] ; nevertheless, the measurements carried out 24 h after stimulation of purified feline cells support induction of Th1-oriented immune responses and enhanced NK cell activity, both highly desired in the contexts of viral infection.

Variability in the immunomodulatory and antiviral effects of ODN 2216 on feline cells was mainly related to the age of the cats. Among middle-aged adult cats, consistency in the stimulatory potential of this molecule was reflected through the highly similar patterns in gene expression profiles induced in immune cells after stimulation, as well as through the moderate deviations in those experiments aiming to characterize the immunomodulatory properties of ODN 2216 (Figure 1 ). The cells of several animals however, in particular cat c08, but also c09 and c12, indicated particularly strong responsiveness to stimulation throughout the study. Such observations are most likely linked to the genetic variability of individuals of an outbred species, as inherited factors are known to play an important role in the magnitude of innate immune responses [69] . With respect to this observation, it should be noted that the SPF origin and maintenance in a barrier facility of the animals included in this study may slightly lower the variability in strength and breadth of innate immune responses, and studies with cells obtained from field cats would give further information on divergence in response to stimulation of the innate immune cells of individual animals. The immune cells of cats of 14 years of age seemed to respond slightly less well to ODN 2216 than those of younger adult animals, while PBMCs of kittens indicated much more reticence to stimulation, with either limited or absent upregulation of both type I IFN and other genes measured after incubation with ODN 2216. Stimulated PBMCs from this group of young animals moreover indicated a tendency to develop an immunologic environment with a Th2 orientation, including higher production of IL-4 and impaired induction of IL-12 compared to cells from adult cats. Although the kittens included in this study were already of 10 weeks of age, these observations strongly corroborate the immature IFN system of neonatal mice [70] , the impaired immune cell activation via TLR9 in human neonatal mononuclear cells [71, 72] and the bias towards Th2 rather than Th1 responses in human fetuses and neonates [73, 74] . Furthermore, concordantly to findings in human neonatal blood [75, 76] , basal TLR9 transcription in kittens indicated levels similar to those of adults. However, ODN 2216 stimulation increased mRNA expression of this gene only in the young animals ( Figure 2C) . These results open new perspectives on possible explanations for the qualitative discrepancy between innate immune responses in newborns and adults. The availability of specific antibodies to feline TLR9 would greatly support further investigations in this direction.

The experiments conducted both in vitro and in vivo in this study underline the feasibility of utilizing Mx as a marker for induction of resistance to viral infections in the domestic cat. Admittedly, both the supernatants of PBMCs stimulated with CpG-A and serum of treated cats contain a mixture of molecules that could play a role in the observed antiviral effects. However, the viral inhibition in our in vitro assays was similar to that obtained after treatment of the cells with rfeIFNα and highly correlated with the induction of Mx transcription in the cell lines incubated with the supernatants. After ODN 2216 injection in vivo, Mx expression in plasma also strongly correlated with its antiviral potential. It is however important to note that Mx mRNA and protein cannot be mechanistically linked to inhibition of the viruses tested. Although the expression of other antiviral molecules such as 2'5'oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and the RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) was not measured, their induction has been reported following CpG ODN stimulation of PBMCs in other species [77, 78] and differential interplay between several effector mechanisms most likely leads to the inhibition of individual viruses.

In comparison to ODN of other groups, CpG-A have been used in much fewer studies concerning innate antiviral responses. This is most likely the result of the more time consuming and costly manufacturing process of these molecules linked to the synthesis of the flanking poly (G) strings necessary for optimal immune effects [31] . Also, CpG-A exhibit only weak stimulation of B cells, which produce antibodies that are valuable in later antiviral responses. Stability of CpG-A in vivo has also been questioned due to the only partial phosphorothioate backbone of these molecules. This can be partially compensated however, by the formation, through association of their poly (G) stretches, of highly ordered Gtetrad structures with enhanced stability [12] . Their smaller content in synthetic backbones could moreover help reduce possible long-term side effects [79, 80] . Most importantly, CpG-A remain the most potent inducers of type I IFN, themselves the most biologically active antiviral molecules known to date [19] . With regard to this, a recombinant feline type I IFN marketed in both Japan (Intercat ® ) and Europe (Virbagen Omega ® ) has made its way into therapeutic protocols for FCV, FHV, FeLV and canine parvovirus infections [67, [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] and has demonstrated preventive capacities in a cattery developing an outbreak of FPV [87] . However, when compared to direct initiation of antiviral mechanisms by a recombinant IFNα protein, administration of CpG ODN holds the advantage of inducing the production of all type I IFN and their subtypes, which have been shown to possess differential antiviral properties and kinetics [88] . Our data demonstrate that five viral species belonging to the Calicivirus, Herpesvirus, Parvovirus, Coronavirus and Retrovirus families were highly sensitive to the immunologic effects of ODN 2216 in feline cells. Strength and breadth of antiviral defense mechanisms induced in vivo by this molecule have the potential to outweigh those observed with recombinant IFN.

In frame with the results of our in vitro experiments, the administration of ODN 2216 in vivo could promote an antiviral state in the domestic cat in the absence of adverse reactions. Just as stimulated PBMCs exhibited high mRNA expression of type I IFN and only a marginal increase in mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNFα, treated cats showed significantly increased Mx expression in their blood and lacked flu-like symptoms generally linked with administration of immunostimulatory molecules in vivo. Additionally, although our in vivo studies included a limited number of cats, the strength of responses to ODN 2216 stimulation in vitro and in vivo for individual animals strongly correlated, indicating that individual sensitivity to stimulation most likely can be predicted with in vitro experiments. Our data further show that a single subcutaneous injection of ODN 2216 sufficed to induce the systemic presence of antiviral molecules for 24 to 36 h in the plasma of treated cats; during this time, an increase of Mx expression of at least 4-fold in the blood of treated cats was indicative of significant inhibition of viral replication in vitro. These observations support possible resistance to viral infection by ODN 2216 for several days, a phenomenon described already in mouse models [89] .

Altogether, this study underlines the strong potential for ODN 2216 in the prevention of a large variety of viral diseases. CpG-A molecules should thus not be left aside when stimulating innate immunity for prophylactic purposes. Future studies should aim at optimizing the kinetics of these molecules in vivo, while addressing safety, stability and manufacturing issues. Combinations with adjuvants or other TLR agonists as well as optimized administration protocols should support research in this direction. Field studies with larger cohorts of animals will provide further insights on the utilization of CpG-A molecules for the prevention of viral infections in a clinical setting.

Profiling of Host Cell Response to Successive Canine Parvovirus Infection Based on Kinetic Proteomic Change Identification OPEN

DEPs with similar quantitative changes were clustered by hierarchical clustering and analysed by gene ontology enrichment, revealing that 12 h and 60 h post-infection were the optimal times to analyse the autonomous parvovirus replication and apoptosis processes, respectively. Using the Metacore TM database, 29 DEPs were enriched in a network involved in p53 regulation. Besides, a significantly enriched pathway suggests that the CPV-induced cytopathic effect was probably due to the deficiency of functional CFTR caused by CPV infection. This study uncovered the systemic changes in key cellular factors involved in CPV infection and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of the anti-cancer activity of CPV and the cytopathic effects induced by CPV infection.

Canine parvovirus (CPV) is a member of autonomous parvoviruses in the Parvoviridae family. It appears as an icosahedral capsid that encloses a single-strand DNA genome that is 5.2 kb long. CPV replicates without the use of a helper virus and hence is called autonomous, but it utilises the machinery and components of host cells, including DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase Ι Ι for DNA replication and RNA transcription, respectively. Consequently, CPV replication is restricted to the S phase of the cell cycle 1,2 .

The CPV genome contains two open reading frames; by alternative splicing, one produces two mRNAs encoding two non-structural proteins (NS1 and NS2), and the other transcribes two mRNAs encoding two structural proteins (VP1 and VP2) 3 . The VP1 and VP2 proteins contain the most important antigenic epitopes, which are targeted by neutralising antibodies. VP2, which represents 90% of the viral capsid, also functions as a viral ligand that determines the viral host specificity and tissue affinity 4 . NS1, a pleiotropic phosphoprotein, is thought to be a culprit of apoptosis of CPV-infected cells. For instance, NS1 of CPV-2 has been shown to induce caspase-dependent and p53-independent apoptosis 5 .

CPV quickly spread worldwide within months of identification and now threatens various species hosts 6 . CPV infection causes high fatality in neonatal animals and severe haemorrhagic enteritis in adult dogs 7 . It is introduced by faecal-oral transmission, and it initially infects and replicates in the rapidly dividing cells of lymphoid tissues, intestinal crypt epithelial cells, and precursor cells in the bone marrow. Severe haemorrhagic enteritis increases the risk for viral translocation and coliform septicaemia, leading to septic shock and ultimately death 8 . CPV infects cells by binding to the transferrin receptor 9 , and CPV pathogenicity is thought to be caused by the non-structural proteins of parvoviruses 10 .

Although infection and replication of parvoviruses kill host cells, the extent of cell death strongly depends on the type of the host cell. For instance, neoplastic cells are preferentially killed over normal cells 11, 12 . Due to this

characteristic, a rodent parvovirus has been used in a phase Ι /Ι Ι a clinical trial to prevent tumour recurrence in patients with glioblastoma multiforma 5 . Currently, the clinical application of several chemotherapeutic agents is limited because of their severe toxic effects to healthy cells. Anti-cancer therapy using a virus that can selectively target cancer cells has become a popular approach. CPV is a virus that can be potentially used to treat cancer 13 . A previous study has shown that CPV2 NS1 can lead to regression of skin tumours in Wistar rats without producing toxic side effects on healthy cells 14 . Moreover, the CPV NS1 protein shows anti-tumour activity in a mouse mammary tumour model, and it further stimulates the immune cells to attack the tumour 15 .

Proteomic based approaches have been widely used to develop extensive cellular protein databases that focus on infection by viruses 16, 17 . However, no such study has been conducted to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in host response to CPV infection. Isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) is an in vitro labelling method that has the capability to compare several time points during a single experiment 18 . The method is considered more sensitive than difference gel electrophoresis, and it has been demonstrated to be effective and accurate in characterising numerous diseases 19, 20 . In this study, we utilised an iTRAQ-labelled mass spectrometry approach to explore the proteomic changes of F81 cells under different cellular growth behaviour induced by CPV infection. Our findings will help to reveal the biological processes of different infection stages and systematically understand the host response under CPV infection.

The F81 cells were selected because they efficiently support CPV replication and show specific cytopathic effects (CPEs) [21] [22] [23] [24] . The cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 and analysed between 0 and 60 h post-infection (hpi). As shown in Fig. 1a , the mock-infected cells maintained growth without obvious CPEs. In contrast, CPEs in the infection groups became noticeable at 36 hpi and progressed thereafter, and more than half of the cells had become detached at 60 hpi. As shown in Fig. 1b , the viral titre reached a plateau between 24 hpi and 60 hpi, and then rapidly declined. Using the dynamic changes in CPEs and viral titre as a guide, time points between 12 hpi and 60 hpi were selected for comprehensive proteomic analysis during which the viral titre remained high while the CPEs progressed in the infected cells.

Based on a combination of three biological replicates from two mocks and five infected samples, the iTRAQ analysis identified a total of 3,224 proteins. Proteins were designated as differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) if they had expression fold-change ratios ≥ 1.2 or ≤ 0.833 and the p-value was less than 0.05. By two statistical methods, we identified 615 DEPs during the entire infection process by method 1 and 437 DEPs for all five time points by method 2 (Fig. 2c ). As shown in Fig. 2a1 ,a2, a total of 679 DEPs were identified by combining the two selection methods, which was greater than the number identified by each of the individual methods. Among the 679 DEPs, 373 proteins were identified by both methods.

Among the 437 DEPs identified by method 2, the expression of 85, 102, 95, 209, and 225 proteins was significantly changed at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hpi, respectively (Fig. 2b) . As shown in Fig. 2b , only 3 of 437 proteins were identified at all five time points. Moreover, 22, 28, 27, 82 , and 86 DEPs were separately identified at the each of the five time points, respectively. These proteins were the key proteins used to study the biological processes at certain time points.

A summary of the 615 quantitatively DEPs obtained by method 1 are shown in Supplementary Table S1 . The quantitatively DEPs selected at each time point by method 2 are listed in Supplementary Tables S2.1 To analyse the potential functions of the significantly DEPs at each time point, we then performed a gene ontology enrichment of biological processes using DAVID software for the proteins obtained by method 2. Generally, gene ontology terms are enriched by David software without fuzzy heuristic clustering. So, an overwhelming number of terms were generated, which were too difficult to analyse. In order to reduce the redundant terms, we re-analysed them by "Functional Annotation Clustering, " and only the term with the minimum p-value in each cluster was reserved. As a result, 60/79, 57/77, 22/33, 119/166, and 91/135 of the biological process terms at each time point were removed.

As shown in Fig. 3a -e, the retained functions of these proteins at each time point are depicted. Enriched functions of the DEPs at 12 hpi were mainly related to the cell cycle, including regulation of the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. At 24 hpi, numerous proteins involved in RNA processing were enriched. By 36 hpi, the DEPs were significantly enriched in proteins related to chromatin assembly (p = 1.88E-14). At 48 hpi, enriched functions were related to cellular macromolecular complex assembly (p = 3.91E-08) and regulation of organelle organisation (p = 2.99E-05). The functional terms in the regulation of apoptosis were enriched at each time point; but at 60 hpi, proteins involved in the regulation of apoptosis became the largest component (8.51%) of all DEPs.

Proteins involved in the stimulus-response and regulation of apoptosis were enriched by Gene Cluster 3.0 and DAVID software. As shown in Fig. 4a , hierarchical clustering of the Felis catus proteins was generated using the DEPs listed in Supplementary Table S1. The analysis revealed that all replicates clustered tightly. Interestingly, the DAVID software analysis showed that most proteins in a given cluster were enriched for functions involved in similar biological processes.

As shown in Fig. 4a , most clusters were enriched in the biological processes of energy metabolism, the cell cycle, translation, and RNA-related functions. Both cluster A (Fig. 4b ) and cluster B (Fig. 4c ) are highlighted. Sixty-nine proteins in cluster A were up-regulated during the whole infection period, especially at 48 hpi and 60 hpi. The DAVID analysis indicated that the proteins in cluster A were mainly associated with cellular apoptosis, including HMOX1, TOP2A, HSPA9, HSPD1, F2, HBB, SLC25A24, BAK1, VDAC2, PHB, APOH, and VIMP. Moreover, five of these proteins were classified as negative regulators of apoptosis.

Furthermore, in cluster B consisting of 35 proteins, 10 are known to be stimulus-responsive, 7 of which are additionally known to respond to viral infections. For instance, both RAB7A and CD63 are required for the HIV-1 replication cycle 25, 26 . In addition, LSD1, HSPA5, and CAV-1 have been reported to influence the efficiency of viral infection and replication [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] ; NPC1 is the key influencer for Ebola virus to enter cells 32 ; SEC22b can inhibit the release of infectious viral progeny 33 ; and the down-regulation of CD59 is associated with the development of hepatitis B cytotoxicity 34 .

A network focusing on p53 regulation and a pathway involving cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) degradation were enriched according to the Metacore TM database. Using Metacore TM software, 29 DEPs associated with p53 were significantly enriched (p-value = 1.130E-49), including BAK1, VDAC2, HSP60, and Ebp1 (Fig. 5) , indicating that CPV infection may trigger biological processes of p53 regulation.

The pathways were enriched and ranked according to their p-values by the Metacore TM database (Supplementary Table S4 ). These pathways are involved in processes of cell cycle regulation, cytoskeleton remodelling, cell apoptosis and survival, oxidative phosphorylation, and immune response. Notably, eight DEPs were enriched in the pathway involved in the "CFTR folding and maturation" with a p-value of 9.398E-06 ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). The detailed analysis depicted in Fig. 6 indicates that eight DEPs were directly or indirectly associated with the CFTR (Derlin 1, AMFR, HSP70, HSP90, Hdi-2, UBE1, BAG-2, and SAE1). Among them, Derlin 1 and AMFR were up-regulated during infection, which can directly degrade the abnormal CFTR 35,36 . iTRAQ-MS data were verified by western blotting. The verification of DEPs by western blotting was limited by the availability of antibodies to Felis catus proteins. Initial tests selected a set of proteins that were significantly changed during infection and also reliably cross-reacted with antibodies to the corresponding human protein. As shown in Fig. 7 , the western blots confirmed the differential expression of ribosomal protein S4X (RPS4X), 60S ribosomal protein L7 (RPL7), guanine nucleotide-binding protein-like 3-like protein (GNL3L), laminin subunit gamma-1 (LAMC1), histone H3.1 (H3.1), 60S ribosomal protein L17 (RPL17), and 60S ribosomal protein L10 (RPL10 or QM) detected by iTRAQ. 

In this study, we used proteomics to investigate the global profiles of differentially expressed cellular proteins under CPV infection. The features of our experimental design and data analysis are as follows: 1. The kinetic changes in the expression levels of cellular proteins along the infection course, consisting of five different time points, were quantified, which represented an improvement over a cross-sectional picture if only a sample from a single time point was analysed; these results provided us a kinetic view of the changed expression of cellular proteins under the cytopathic insult of CPV infection. 2. Two mocks were analysed. These two mocks helped to distinguish the natural kinetics of the cellular protein expression and helped to set reasonable standards to screen the DEPs. 3. Three biological replicates were prepared for each sample to assess inter-experimental variations. 4. The DEPs identified over the whole infection process were determined to be significant by an analysis of variance test, while those at each of the five time points were determined to be significant by the two-tailed unpaired t test.

As expected, a large amount of proteomic data was generated in this study. Venn diagramming functional annotation, hierarchical clustering, and pathway enrichment were utilised to analyse the results. A common analysis strategy in proteomics is to look for a period in which the changes in the protein expression were the most prominent. However, such a strategy is dissociated from the status of viral infection and the impact on the infected cells. A different strategy in this study was employed that combined the detected significant changes in DEPs with viral replication and CPEs. In view of the CPEs and the one-step growth curve shown in Fig. 1b , the viral titre was increased quickly during the first 12 hpi. In addition, the DEPs involved in the mitotic cell cycle were significantly enriched by up to 6.74% of the total DEPs at 12 hpi (Fig. 3 ). Since the cells had efficient proliferation at 12 hpi, this time point was suitable for studying the cellular proteins involved in autonomous parvovirus replication.

As shown in Fig. 4c , the proteins involved in the stimulus-response were enriched, and most of them are reported to respond to viral infection. These proteins can be potential targets for controlling viral infection. Dynamic changes in the expressed proteins in cluster B were noted. They were initially down-regulated at 12 and 24 hpi, followed by a rapid return to near basal levels at 36 hpi and slight up-regulation at 48 and 60 hpi. Thus, 12 and 24 hpi were the best time points to study these proteins (Fig. 4) .

Similarly, 60 hpi was the optimal time point to analyse the DEPs involved in the regulation of apoptosis because apoptosis-related proteins accounted for the largest percentage at this time point (Fig. 3e) , and the CPEs were the most serious at 60 hpi (Fig. 1b) . As shown in Fig. 4b , many proteins related to cell apoptosis were enriched in cluster A, and they were up-regulated during the entire infection period, but most strikingly at 48 and 60 hpi. Thus, we concluded that the late stage of CPV infection was a better time to investigate the CPV-induced F81 cell apoptosis process. As apoptosis may be the main mechanism utilised by viral oncolytic therapy, these identified DEPs may be useful for detailed studies in the future.

The anti-cancer activity of CPV is closely related to its apoptosis-inducing effect. A previous study has shown that CPV2 NS1 induces apoptosis mainly through the mitochondrial pathway 37 . Coincidently, we found that BAK1 was up-regulated at 48 hpi and 60 hpi in this study. BAK is a pro-apoptotic regulator that plays a central role in mitochondrial membrane permeabilisation 38 . It suppresses tumourigenesis by mediating apoptosis of tumour cells 39 . For example, BAK over-expression can effectively induce apoptosis in gastric cancer cells 40 . Also, elevations in BAK protein levels have been shown to accelerate apoptosis in murine lymphoid, lung cancer, and breast cancer cells 41 . In addition, VDAC2, which can recruit newly synthesised BAK to the mitochondria to carry out apoptosis 42 , was also up-regulated at 48 hpi and 60 hpi in our study. These findings remind us that the anti-cancer activity of CPV may be closely related to the over-expression of BAK1 and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway that is mediated by it. Lakshman Santra et al. suggest that CPV2 NS1 might be effective against tumours with the p53 mutation 43 . As a critical effector of apoptosis, BAK can participate in the apoptotic process without activation of p53. Therefore, over-expression of the bak gene may be a new strategy for the treatment of tumours, especially for tumours bearing p53 mutations.

What's more, we enriched a panel of 29 proteins that are associated with p53 by Metacore TM software, as shown in Fig. 5 . As p53 is known as an important anti-cancer protein, these proteins could be related to cancer development. For instance, API5 was enriched in this network, and the API5 expression level was reduced in F81 cells at 48 hpi and 60 hpi. API5 is an apoptosis inhibitory protein that can suppress E2F-dependent apoptosis 44 . It is frequently up-regulated in tumour cells and functions as a master regulator of immune escape genes in tumours 45 . Based on these findings, CPV may be a powerful apoptosis-modulating agent that could down-regulate API5 gene expression.

We found that the HSP60 expression level was increased at 60 hpi. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a group of proteins that respond to stress, including heat, hypoxia, irradiation, infection, or toxic agents 46 . HSP has been shown to influence apoptosis in tumour cells, regulate p53 function, and induce an immune response to tumours 47 . Increased HSP levels make cells more resistant to apoptosis, but they also can increase immunity to cancer 48 . For example, over-expressed HSP60 protein is suggested to promote prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and primary breast cancer; for these cancers, HSP60 inhibitors may be used as anti-cancer agents [49] [50] [51] . Whereas, a loss of HSP60 immunopositivity is related to the development and progression of bronchial cancer in smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 52 . In this experiment, we also identified that the HSP70 expression level was increased at 60 hpi and the HSP90A expression level was decreased at 48 hpi and 60 hpi. As the influence of the HSP expression changes due to different cancers, the anti-cancer significance of the differential expression of HSPs in CPV-infected cells is complicated and requires further study.

Previous studies have shown that the CPV NS1 protein exhibits anti-tumour activity in mammary tumours and skin tumours 13, 15 , but the complete mechanisms of its anti-cancer activity have not been revealed. In this study, we first identified a group of cancer-related proteins by a proteomics technique. Some of these proteins were not noted for CPV-induced apoptosis or anti-cancer function, which would provide a new perspective for studying the anti-cancer mechanisms of CPV.

Using Metacore TM software, we were able to suggest the main pathways related to CPV infection. Interestingly, a pathway that involved the degradation of CFTR was significantly enriched in our study. CFTR is a transmembrane protein that functions as an ATP-gated chloride channel 53 . Deficiency in CFTR can lead to several diseases related to the reduction of chloride secretion and the increase of sodium uptake 54 . Many studies have suggested that wound healing function is impaired in CFTR-deficient epithelial cells and that CFTR may be effective in cell repair after injury 18, 55, 56 . CPV is normally cytopathic in infected F81 cells. Typical CPEs appear as a mesh of monolayer cells prompted by detached cells. These results provided us hints that CPV may trigger CFTR deficiency and influence the cell pathological change by reducing the wound healing of infected cells.

In summary, DEPs and their expression kinetics in CPV-infected F81 cells were characterised with iTRAQ analysis. There were dynamic changes in DEPs over the course of infection. DEPs that are involved in viral defence or apoptosis and are related to cancer may be useful for studying anti-viral and oncolytic therapy. Finally, 

General experimental design. CPV-HLJ-6 (GenBank accession no. KR611475.1) was passaged ten times in F81 cells, resulting in a final stock containing viruses at 10 5.5 TCID 50 /mL. For infection, 10 6 F81 cells were plated in 25 cm 2 culture flasks and, at the same time, inoculated by CPV at a MOI of 1. Infected cells were collected at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hpi, and uninfected mock-treated cells were collected at 0 and 48 h after plating. All experiments were repeated in three biological replicates with cells at different passage numbers.

(Thermo Scientific ™ ), containing a protease inhibitor cocktail, for 10 min under gentle shaking conditions. The samples were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 10 min, and the supernatants were collected. The protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford protein assay. iTRAQ labelling and peptide fractionation. The iTRAQ labelling was conducted according to the protocol of the iTRAQ reagents (8 plex, Applied Biosystems). Briefly, the protein samples were thermally denatured, reduced, and alkylated prior to trypsin (Promega) digestion for 15 h. The digested samples were labelled with each component of the iTRAQ reagent kit: two mock samples were labelled with 113 and 114; and five CPV-infected samples collected at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hpi were labelled with 115, 116, 117, 118, and 119, respectively. Three biological replicates were prepared for all samples. Next, an equal ratio of each set was pooled for analysis.

Additionally, to reduce the complexity of the peptide mixtures, reverse-phase chromatography using a RIGOL L-3000 system was applied for separating the peptides. The labeled peptide mixtures were dissolved in 100 μ L of mobile phase A [2% acetonitrile in ddH 2 O, pH 10] and centrifuged at 14,000 g for 20 min prior to loading onto the column. Samples were eluted by injection of stepwise gradients of mobile phase B [2% ddH 2 O in acetonitrile, pH 10], with a flow rate set at 700 μ L/min. Each fraction was eluted for 1.5 min. Analysis by Q-Exactive mass spectrometry. The fractionated peptide mixtures were analysed by a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer equipped with an EASY-nLC 1000 System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The spray voltage, capillary temperature, and declustering potential of the source ionisation parameters were set as 2.1 kV, 250 °C, and 100 V, respectively.

A Top 20 data-dependent acquisition mode was selected in the mass spectrometer, with automatic switching between MS and MS/MS. Full-scan MS mode (350− 1800 m/z) was operated at a resolution of 70,000, with an automatic gain control target of 1 × 10 6 ions and a maximum ion transfer of 60 ms. The precursor ions were fragmented by high-energy collisional dissociation and subjected to MS/MS scans with the following parameters: resolution, 17,500; automatic gain control, 5 × 10 6 ions; maximum ion transfer, 70 ms; intensity threshold, 5,000; and normalised collision energy, 29%.

Database searching and protein quantitation. All raw data files generated by mass spectrometry were analysed by Proteome Discoverer software 1.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the Mascot search engine against the Felis catus protein sequences downloaded from the NCBI reference sequences (Refseq) database (downloaded on March 20, 2015, containing 35,247 entries). The parameters for database searching were as follows: trypsin was selected as the enzyme; up to two missed cleavages were allowed; the precursor and fragment ion mass tolerance were set to 15 ppm and 20 mmu, respectively; carbamidomethylation on cysteine was set as a fixed modification; oxidation on methionine and iTRAQ 8 plex labels at the N-termini and at lysine side chains were allowed as dynamic modifications. The strict maximum parsimony principle was applied, and only peptide spectrum matches with high or medium confidence were considered for protein grouping. Ion peaks were integrated based on the most confident centroid with a tolerance of 20 ppm.

The quantification was also performed by Proteome Discoverer software 1.3, which can automatically calculate the relative abundance of iTRAQ-labeled peptides as well as the corresponding proteins. Proteins identified with two or more unique peptides were considered as a highly confident identification and used for quantification. Also, to ensure the accuracy of quantification, only the proteins whose coefficient of variation of three biological repeats were less than 20% were identified as DEPs. The protein ratios were calculated from channels (114/113 to 119/113) for all proteins identified in each iTRAQ experiment. Two identical mock samples, with iTRAQ labels of 113 and 114, were used as references. The fold threshold for changed protein fold-change ratios was set at ± 1.20, which covers a 95% quantification area based on the normal distribution of two mock samples (113 versus 114) in all biological replicates 57 . Thus, the proteins with fold-change ratios ≥ 1.20 or ≤ 0.83 were selected as DEPs.

To identify the DEPs more comprehensively, we used two methods: An analysis of variance test that included a p-value < 0.05 and at least one of the fold-change ratios between any time points passing the threshold was used to identify the DEPs of all groups (Method 1). Furthermore, to clarify the protein alterations of each time points, a two-tailed unpaired t test that included a p-value < 0.05 and a fold-change ratio between a given time point and the mock (114) passing the threshold was used for screening the DEPs at the different time points (Method 2).

Bioinformatics data analysis. The majority of the proteins in the Felis catus database are not annotated with biological functions. Nevertheless, because most of the identified proteins shared high homologies to Homo sapien proteins, we blasted DEPs defined by iTRAQ analysis with the H. sapien protein database in Swissprot. Only the proteins with at least 70% identity were considered to be matched.

The DEPs were submitted to the online software DAVID (http://david.ncifcrf.gov) for enrichment analysis of the gene ontology category "Biological Process". Redundant items were reduced by "Functional Annotation Clustering" with medium classification stringency. The terms with the minimum p-values in every cluster were then selected out and reserved.

The patterns of differential protein expression were displayed by hierarchical clustering according to the fold-change ratios. The protein relationships were calculated by average linkage with uncentered correlation using Gene Cluster 3.0.

The network analysis of the DEPs was performed by the "Analyze Network Algorithm" provided by Metacore TM software. The pathway analysis of the DEPs was performed using the GeneGo pathway maps in the Metacore TM database (version 6.24; build 67895, Thomson Reuters). In addition, the Pathway Maps tool was used for pathway enrichment evaluation, in which the p-values were calculated based on the hypergeometric distribution with the default background database.

Western blot analysis. Cells were harvested and cellular proteins were extracted as mentioned above. Total cellular proteins from different time points were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman). The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk powder dissolved in tris-buffered saline, containing 0.05% Tween-20, for 2 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies (see below) were diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer and incubated with the membranes overnight at 4 °C. Next, the membranes were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer at 1:3000 for 2 h at room temperature. Detected proteins were revealed using the ECL Detection Kit (KeyGen Biotech).

The following rabbit antibodies were used: Ribosomal Protein S4X Polyclonal Antibody (YT4135), Ribosomal Protein L17 Polyclonal Antibody (YT4098), QM Polyclonal Antibody (YT3916), Histone H3.1 Polyclonal Antibody (YT2163), Laminin γ -1 Polyclonal Antibody (YT2531), GNL3L Polyclonal Antibody (YT1938), Ribosomal Protein L7 Polyclonal Antibody (YT4118), and β -Actin Polyclonal Antibody YT0099). All the rabbit antibodies were purchased from ImmunoWay Biotechnology Company. The Peroxidase AffiniPure goat Anti-Rabbit IgG was used as the secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab.).

Hantavirus Immunology of Rodent Reservoirs: Current Status and Future Directions

Hantaviruses are hosted by rodents, insectivores and bats. Several rodent-borne hantaviruses cause two diseases that share many features in humans, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Eurasia or hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome in the Americas. It is thought that the immune response plays a significant contributory role in these diseases. However, in reservoir hosts that have been closely examined, little or no pathology occurs and infection is persistent despite evidence of adaptive immune responses. Because most hantavirus reservoirs are not model organisms, it is difficult to conduct meaningful experiments that might shed light on how the viruses evade sterilizing immune responses and why immunopathology does not occur. Despite these limitations, recent advances in instrumentation and bioinformatics will have a dramatic impact on understanding reservoir host responses to hantaviruses by employing a systems biology approach to identify important pathways that mediate virus/reservoir relationships.

Hantaviruses (family Bunyaviridae, genus Hantavirus) are negative-stranded, trisegmented viruses that cause about 200,000 disease cases annually, with case fatality rates of 0.5%-40%, depending on the virus [1] . The viral gene segments encode four or five polypeptides. The large (L) segment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the medium (M) segment encodes a precursor that is posttranslationally cleaved into Gn and Gc glycoproteins, and the small (S) segment encodes the nucleocapsid (N) protein. Some hantaviruses encode a second nonstructural polypeptide (NSs) downstream from the N start site in frame 2 [2, 3] . Little is known about the immunomodulatory abilities of these proteins; however, there is evidence the N, Gn and NSs may alter host cellular responses during infection.

More than 20 hantavirus species have been classified, and many more unclassified hantaviruses have been identified. They are hosted by several species of rodents (Rodentia), insectivores (Insectivora), and bats (Chiroptera) [4] . Little work has been conducted to understand hantavirus infections of insectivores or bats; however, much is known about the ecology of rodent-borne hantaviruses because of their impact on human health (Table 1) . A central problem of hantavirus/reservoir host research is the lack of reagents and methods for experimentally examining the immune response. Recent experimental work on the immunology of rodent reservoirs, summarized in an exceptional review by Easterbrook and Klein [5] , has begun to clarify these issues. The immune response is energetically expensive for wild animals, thus the findings of experimental studies will be critical for understanding the ecoimmunology of reservoir hosts of hantaviruses [6, 7] , and experiments using wild rodents in natural or semi-natural environments [8, 9] will be required to validate laboratory findings.

Rodentia is the largest mammalian order and is comprised of about 1,800 species [10] . Only a few dozen species have been identified as susceptible hosts, and most hantaviruses are hosted by a single rodent species [11] . In each hantavirus/rodent reservoir relationship, infection results in two prominent features: no conspicuous pathology and persistent infection [12] [13] [14] . The earliest report of experimental infection of a reservoir host with its hantavirus was by Lee et al. [15] that described infection of striped field mice (Apodemus agrarius) with Hantaan virus. Inoculated mice developed chronic infection with transient viremia, and shed virus principally in urine, saliva and, to a lesser extent, feces, despite the production of neutralizing antibodies.

Currently, three laboratory infection systems have been developed to study hantavirus infections of reservoir hosts: Seoul virus (SEOV) infection of the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus), Puumala virus (PUUV) infection of the bank vole (Myodes glareolus), and Sin Nombre virus (SNV) infection of the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) [12, 14, 16] . In humans, these viruses are etiologic agents of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS; SEOV, PUUV) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS; SNV) [1]. These diseases share many pathologic similarities and because little damage to the endothelium occurs during infection, it is thought that the inflammatory immune response contributes to pathogenesis [17, 18] . Because the Norway rat is a model organism with many specific reagents, including monoclonal antibodies to immune markers, significant progress has been made toward understanding the reservoir host immune response to SEOV [19] [20] [21] . Fewer methods and reagents are available for bank voles and deer mice. Despite these limitations, emerging technologies will be useful for understanding why rodent reservoirs are infected without disease and why they are unable to clear infection. A significant limitation of HFRS research is that none of the HFRS-causing hantaviruses cause disease in animal models. However, two New World hantaviruses cause an HCPS-like disease in Syrian golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus): Andes virus (ANDV) and Maporal virus (MAPV) [22, 23] . ANDV causes most HCPS cases in South America; however, no human cases of disease have been associated with MAPV. ANDV is hosted by the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (Oligoryzomys longicaudatus) and MAPV is hosted by the delicate pygmy rice rat (Oligoryzomys delicatus) [24, 25] . ANDV is considered an animal biosafety level-4 pathogen in most nations, whereas MAPV is considered an ABSL-3 virus [26] .

The natural route of transmission among reservoir rodents is thought to be principally through aerosols and/or biting [27] . However, experiments have been equivocal in clarifying transmission mechanisms. Weanling bank voles caged with infected individuals lead to transmission as early as 14 days post exposure [14] . Similar experiments examining SNV transmission between deer mice have been less informative; however, in artificial enclosure experiments, transmission appeared to be facilitated by deer mice with higher amounts of viremia and wounding [8] and males likely play a dominant role in transmission in natural populations [9, 28, 29] . In bank voles, offspring of PUUV-infected dams were less likely to be infected after exiting the nest because of protective maternal antibody [30] . Although it is thought horizontal transmission is most important, work by Hutchinson et al. [31] showed that vertical transmission occurred among cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) infected with Black Creek Canal virus, so it is possible that both routes may influence transmission at the population level.

The route of transmission has important ramifications in terms of the host immune response where, presumably, a mucosal response occurs with aerosol transmission and a localized response at a bite site. Experimental data have also shown that patterns of the expression of genes related to the immune response are different in infected males and females [32] , and it is likely these differences have important roles in hantavirus ecology. Spillover to other rodent species also occurs [33] [34] [35] [36] , but it is unknown if the rodents remain infected. Recent work has shown that deer mice are experimentally susceptible to ANDV; however, virus is cleared several weeks after infection [37] . A pronounced Th2/Tfh gene expression profile occurs, including IL-4 pathway activation, that does not appear to be substantially activated in SNV-infected deer mice [13, 38] . This system provides an opportunity to identify viral and reservoir host factors that are important for sterilizing immunity that clears infection.

The principal target cells of infection in rodents (and humans) are the microvasculature endothelial cells of many tissues [39] . Experimental intramuscular infection of deer mice with SNV resulted in detectable virus in the lungs as few as two days later [13] . Many organs appeared infected, although infection was limited to the vasculature within those tissues. Two infectious outcomes occur in experimentally infected deer mice; a disseminated infection of three or more organs, or a restricted infection of the lungs and heart [40] . The relevance of these two patterns to transmission efficiency is unknown. The levels of viral RNA vary dramatically in infected deer mice, with most having modest to moderate levels of RNA at the peak of infection. However, some deer mice have significantly greater amounts of viral RNA, suggesting these deer mice may produce substantially more virus than others, and it is possible they transmit virus more efficiently (e.g., "supershedders") [13] . This also occurs in semi-natural transmission experiments [9] and suggests certain individuals may have a prominent role in population-level transmission of hantaviruses.

Most serological assays for detecting antibody responses in hantavirus reservoirs use virus neutralization, ELISA or strip immunoblotting [12, 29, [41] [42] [43] . While some of these assays are IgG-specific, others use antiserum to whole IgG, including the light chains. Since light chains are shared by all immunoglobulins, these detection antibodies are not IgG-specific. Moreover, no assays are in place for detecting IgA, which should be prominent in mucosal infections. IgM assays have been problematic despite the availability of anti-IgM capture antisera that are cross-reactive with IgM from at least one hantavirus reservoir species [44] . Some immunoglobulins have isotypes with specific effector activities, such as complement fixation or antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. Laboratory house mice have four IgG isotypes; IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3. It is likely that reservoirs also have immunoglobulin isotypes with distinct effector functions and which might predominate during hantavirus infections. These reagent deficiencies are a current obstacle for assessing antibody responses in rodent reservoir hosts. Despite these limitations, many field studies have been conducted examining antibody responses in natural and semi-natural hantavirus infections of rodent reservoirs [34, [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] .

In experimentally-infected deer mice, SNV nucleocapsid-specific antibodies can be detected in serum as early as 10 days post infection, and neutralizing antibody can be detected after three weeks post infection [13] . Similarly, experimentally-infected bank voles produce PUUV-specific antibodies two to three weeks after inoculation [14] and rats experimentally infected with SEOV also produce IgG within two weeks post inoculation [52] . The presence of IgG in these naturally and experimentally infected reservoirs is an indicator of class switching and affinity maturation, events that are mediated by T cells [53] . Thus, rodents mount adaptive T cell/B cell immune responses to their reservoir hantaviruses; however, it appears to be inadequate for virus clearance. While inflammatory signatures are present [13, 20, 54] , the magnitude of these signals appears to be modest relative to expression levels found in a Syrian hamster pathology model of HCPS [55] . It is noteworthy that immunization of rodent reservoirs with homologous nucleocapsid antigen or plasmids encoding the antigen protects from subsequent challenge [56, 57] , suggesting infection can be prevented in reservoir hosts.

Several hantavirus proteins have been implicated in modulation of the host cell's antiviral defenses ( Table 2 ). The Gn glycoproteins of pathogenic New World hantaviruses and SEOV possess an immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif (ITAM) in the cytoplasmic tail that binds to Fyn tyrosine kinase, and the ITAM may also interact with Lyn, Syk, and ZAP-70 kinases found in lymphocytes [58, 59] , although there is no evidence that lymphocytes are susceptible to hantaviruses. The ITAM may also promote polyubiquitination of the Gn polypeptide to facilitate its degradation [60] ; however, it is unclear how it impacts the host response to infection. Presumably, the ITAM interferes with the antiviral response of an infected cell since the motif is cytoplasmic. The Gn protein may also alter the RIG-I pathway that leads to IRF3 phosphorylation and subsequent Ifnβ expression [61] . The nucleocapsid may also antagonize the expression of Ifnβ by binding to importin-α and interfering with NF-κB nuclear transport, which is required for Ifnβ expression [62] [63] [64] . Additionally, both caspase 3 and granzyme B are targets of the nucleocapsid of some hantaviruses [65] and both are essential components of CTL-mediated apoptosis. The lack of damage to the endothelium of infected rodent reservoirs suggests this may be an important mechanism of preventing viral clearance. The nucleocapsid of ANDV, but not other hantaviruses, also inhibits autophosphorylation and activation of TBK1, an enzyme that activates IRF3 and NF-κB and induction of type I interferon gene expression [66] .

Recently, putative nonstructural NSs sequences have been identified in some hantaviruses [3, 67] . This sequence is in an alternative reading frame of the nucleocapsid transcript. In other bunyaviruses, NSs has anti-interferon activity [68] [69] [70] ; however, its role in hantavirus infections is less well characterized.

Importantly, these studies have been conducted with cells from nonreservoir hosts where they, presumably, are not optimized for manipulating the immune response in a manner that benefits the virus but without host pathology. Future studies should examine the roles of these proteins in cells from reservoir hosts.

The presence of high-titer IgG antibodies during hantavirus infections of reservoir hosts indicates both T cell and B cell responses occur because T cells induce class switching and affinity maturation of antibodies produced by antigen-specific B cells. In experimental infections of rats with SEOV and deer mice with SNV, early infection results in subtle inflammatory signatures, but a regulatory T cell (Treg) response predominates at persistence (Figure 1 ) [20, 54] . Treg responses are critical for suppressing inflammation [71, 72] ; however, inflammation is a prominent feature of hantavirus disease in humans [73] and hamsters [55, 74] . In other viral diseases, the occurrence of a Treg response is associated with persistent infection because these cells, while suppressing inflammation, also prevent virus clearance [75, 76] . For reservoirs of hantaviruses, the Treg response may limit inflammatory immunopathology to an otherwise innocuous infection, but it may also impair virus clearance. How this relationship evolved is unknown, but considering the presence of hantavirus proteins with immunomodulatory activities, it suggests the viruses may manipulate the host response to favor persistence; a Treg response may prevent sterilizing immunity, thus allow virus to remain in a population. It may also explain the ecoimmunology and ecology of hantavirus infections of reservoir hosts, thus studies assessing the energetics of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory immune responses should be performed.

Much of the work examining reservoir responses to hantaviruses has been conducted in rats infected with SEOV and deer mice infected with SNV or ANDV. Using cDNA arrays, Klein et al. [77] identified nearly 2000 genes that were differentially expressed in male and female rats infected with SEOV. Many immune-associated transcription factors, proinflammatory, antiviral, T cell and Ig family member genes were significantly higher in females, which may reduce transmission from females.

In deer mice infected with SNV, early expression signatures of a mixed Th1/Th2/Treg response were present in virus-specific CD4 + T cells, including Ifnγ, Il4, Il5 and Tgfβ, before transitioning to a Treg-like response at persistence [54] . The expression of immune response genes differed in the spleen, where signatures of inflammation occurred within two days, peaking by days 10 to 15 before subsiding, and lungs, where little immune gene expression occurred [13] . Some deer mice produced nucleocapsid-specific IgG by day 10 while others had IgG around day 20 or later, and neutralizing antibody was not detected until after 3 weeks. . During acute infection, SNV elicits a modest inflammatory response that initially limits, but does not clear, virus. Within a few weeks, the response transitions to a regulatory response that may allow episodic recrudescence of virus that can be shed.

In deer mice infected with SNV, early expression signatures of a mixed Th1/Th2/Treg response were present in virus-specific CD4 + T cells, including Ifnγ, Il4, Il5 and Tgfβ, before transitioning to a Treg-like response at persistence [54] . The expression of immune response genes differed in the spleen, where signatures of inflammation occurred within two days, peaking by days 10 to 15 before subsiding, and lungs, where little immune gene expression occurred [13] . Some deer mice produced nucleocapsid-specific IgG by day 10 while others had IgG around day 20 or later, and neutralizing antibody was not detected until after 3 weeks.

Assessment of cytotoxic T cell responses of reservoir hosts has not been reported. Most assays that assess CTL functions require susceptible syngeneic target cells, which have been difficult to obtain with reservoir hosts. Susceptible primary cell lines from reservoir hosts have been produced [37, 78] , but these are typically obtained from embryonic fibroblasts, thus matching of MHC alleles for use in CTL assays is difficult.

Many zoonotic viruses antagonize the innate immune response in human cells, and their pathogenic potential often correlates with their abilities to inhibit the innate response in vitro ( [79] [80] [81] [82] for review). Pathogenic hantaviruses inhibit antiviral responses despite high levels of replication, whereas nonpathogenic viruses are efficiently recognized and elicit innate responses that limit replication [83, 84] . This antagonistic capacity must have evolved in the reservoir hosts of these hantaviruses because humans are dead-end hosts. To date, few studies have addressed the interactions between hantaviruses and their rodent hosts in vitro. This is partially due to the unavailability of cell lines, and the reagents and techniques to generate primary cell cultures from the various reservoirs of hantaviruses. The Norway rat/SEOV system is the most tractable for studying virus/reservoir interactions. Inoculation of rat lung-derived endothelial cells with SEOV resulted in virus replication, but little or no induction of cytokines or chemokines, suggesting SEOV can efficiently antagonize antiviral responses [21] . Despite this, endothelial cells increased their expression of the protein PD-L1, which correlated with the ability of these cells to induce Treg cell activity. In addition, antigen presenting cells isolated from Norway rats and infected with SEOV in vitro were resistant to stimulation, suggesting that virus infection inhibits the normal signaling activities of these cells [85] . Thus antagonism of the innate immune response likely allows for viral replication, while at the same time promotes an anti-inflammatory response that limits immunopathology.

Similar studies have been performed using bank vole cells infected with PUUV [78] . Embryonic fibroblasts inoculated with PUUV did not express increased amounts of Ifnβ or Mx2, although non-related viruses were able to induce up-regulation of these genes. This suggests, as with SEOV, PUUV efficiently antagonizes host innate responses in its natural reservoir.

The Syrian golden hamster develops an HCPS-like disease when infected with ANDV or MAPV [22, 23] . Hamsters inoculated with ANDV mount an inflammatory response, as measured by elevated mRNA encoding pro-inflammatory mediators, prior to succumbing to the disease [55] . Infection also results in the activation of the adaptive immune response, characterized by antigen-specific proliferation of T cells and the generation of virus-specific antibodies [74, 86] . In contrast, SNV, which is highly pathogenic in humans, replicates in hamsters, but does not cause disease and is cleared by the immune response [87] . Passaging of SNV in hamsters results in a virus that is able to replicate efficiently and cause a persistent infection similar to what is seen in the rodent reservoir, yet still does not cause disease [88] . Examination of immune responses elicited by ANDV (pathogenic in hamsters) and SNV (non-pathogenic in hamsters) showed that passaged SNV evoked a stronger adaptive immune response than did ANDV; however, ANDV infection induced a much stronger innate immune response at late time points, despite both viruses replicating to similar levels. Depletion of T cells did not alter the outcome of infection [74, 86] ; thus, these data suggest that, at least in the hamster model, the activation of the T cell-mediated immune response is not responsible for immunopathogenesis, and perhaps the innate immune response, either elicited from infected endothelial cells, macrophages and/or neutrophils, might contribute to disease.

Infectious diseases and the immune response are complex processes that are challenging to study, even with substantial reagent resources and mature methodologies. Many difficulties exist for studying hantavirus infections of their reservoir hosts, including the lack of molecular and immunological reagents, methods for experimental investigation, and that few reservoir species have been colonized for laboratory use. In addition, pathogenic hantaviruses require BSL-3 and/or ABSL-4 containment, which presents logistical hurdles for examining the reservoir host/hantavirus relationship. Despite these limitations, novel instrumentation, particularly those for transcriptome profiling (e.g., RNA-Seq) and metabolomics, and development of molecular and cellular methods, provide an opportunity to rapidly develop the tools necessary for examining reservoir host responses using a systems biology approach. The key feature of these new technologies is that they are species-independent in the data they generate, but they require significant computational and bioinformatics resources.

Infection triggers a cascading host response that is highly orchestrated by the vertebrate immune system. Many genes are modulated (expressed or repressed) during the course of infection and identification of mRNA and noncoding RNAs can be used to identify the mechanisms that control, or fail to control, disease. Moreover, some infectious diseases, including hantavirus disease, have substantial immunopathologic components. The quantitative assessment of the transcriptional landscape (patterns of gene expression) can be used to profile the host responses in infected and uninfected animals of the same species, or a disease model species to reservoir host species to identify mechanisms of susceptibility or resistance. RNA-Seq is one such method for profiling transcriptional landscapes [89] . The depth of coverage and costs of RNA-Seq have improved dramatically in the last few years, and it is likely to become less expensive. However, the computational resources necessary for using RNA-Seq for studying host responses is substantial, often requiring hundreds of gigabytes of RAM and multicore, multiprocessor systems typically found in servers running a Linux operating system [90] . This depth is often necessary to detect RNAs that occur in extremely low abundance because their proteins are highly potent (e.g., cytokines). Even then, it is possible that differentially expressed genes may not be detected and other, more sensitive methods, such as real-time PCR, may be required to validate pathway signatures. Despite these requirements, bioinformatics tools for RNA-Seq are now widely available, many of which are free. A typical first step of differential gene expression profiling is the de novo assembly of all RNA-Seq samples from an experiment, which represents the totality of expressed genes from the experiment. There are several de novo assemblers available, including the Trinity suite [90] and Oases [91] . Each of these packages has advantages and disadvantages, thus it is important to understand how each performs assemblies, particularly isoforms that may have specific activities. Included in the Trinity package is RSEM [92] that estimates transcript abundances, including isoforms, in experimental samples by counting reads from replicates against the de novo assembly. An important feature of RSEM is that it does not require an annotated genome; it determines the abundance of transcripts from the unannotated assembly, identifies differentially expressed transcripts, and provides a 95% credibility interval for each gene. Additional tools, such as DESeq and edgeR [93, 94] provide statistical evaluation of differential gene expression between samples and provide quantitative (higher/lower) and qualitative (on/off) data. The differentially expressed transcripts are subsequently identified by other means (e.g., BLAST) and can then be mapped to pathways (such as Reactome or KEGG) [95, 96] to visualize [97] where viruses may influence the host response and identify mechanistic targets of hantaviruses.

In recent years, microRNAs (miRNA) have been identified that are important regulators of antiviral responses. Activation of TLR/RIG-I pathways leads to the expression of several miRNAs [98] that likely are important in lymphocyte functions [99] . Because hantavirus Gn targets RIG-I [61] , it is possible that these miRNAs are dysregulated, which could provide the virus an advantage over the host cell response. While miRNA expression has been evaluated in hantavirus-infected human endothelial cells, epithelial cells and macrophages [100, 101] , no work has been conducted to examine the role of miRNAs in reservoir host cells infected with hantaviruses. Considering the importance of miRNA in host responses, it is likely they play an instrumental role in the immunological events leading to persistent infection of the reservoir hosts. The use of RNA-Seq can identify global miRNA expression [102] and clarify their regulatory roles in infected reservoirs.

Metabolic products can provide substantial information about the interactions of viruses and infected host cells, and the how immune system responds to infection [103, 104] . The field of metabolomics is young but potentially informative for understanding hantavirus/reservoir host interactions. Many viruses metabolically remodel the host cell to optimize infection. Because metabolic products (e.g., carbohydrates, lipids, prostaglandins, etc.) are identical or highly similar between vertebrate species, this approach may help identify which enzymes, by virtue of their metabolic products, may be targeted by hantaviruses. While there are no reports of metabolic assessment of hantavirus infections, Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) modulates the activity of adenosine 5' monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in infected cells. This enzyme is a regulator of several metabolic pathways, including enhancement of catabolic pathways such as autophagy and ATP production, but it represses anabolic pathways, such as lipid biosynthesis. Infection of cells by several viruses, including RVFV, results in activation of AMPK and restriction of viral replication, suggesting an antiviral role for this enzyme [105] . Other studies have revealed metabolic pathway targeting by viruses [106] [107] [108] , thus efforts to examine how hantaviruses may manipulate the metabolomes of infected cells could lead to the identification of therapeutic targets for treating hantavirus disease.

The use of monoclonal antibodies has been particularly challenging for hantavirus/reservoir research. Identification of cell surface markers could shed light on what cells respond during hantavirus infection of reservoir hosts. While cell surface antigens tend to be more divergent, intracellular proteins, such as antiviral proteins, tend to be more conserved, particularly phosphoepitopes. Thus, it is likely that many available antibodies to house mouse (Mus musculus) or Norway rat antiviral proteins will be cross-reactive with orthologs from hantavirus rodent reservoir species. Without information as to which proteins may be of interest, screening of antibodies is a daunting and expensive task since most likely will not be informative. However, combined with RNA-Seq and metabolomic data, it is likely that target proteins and pathways can be identified so that investigators can focus their efforts and resources. In addition, software tools can help predict whether antibodies may be cross-reactive to proteins from reservoir hosts [109] .

The use of cytokines or neutralizing cytokine antibodies to perturb the host response during infection has identified many mechanisms that contribute to susceptibility or resistance. For example, administration of IFNγ to laboratory mice facilitates clearance of LCMV, whereas antibody that neutralizes IFNγ impairs CTL responses and clearance, thus leading to persistent infection [110, 111] . Depletion of immune cell subsets with antibodies can also determine the roles of those cells during infection. This approach revealed a critical role for CD4 + T cells for sustaining CTL responses to LCMV [112] . Other than the Norway rat, an array of cytokines and antibodies for experimental manipulation of the host response of hantavirus reservoirs is substantially limited. Thus, it is difficult to determine the mechanisms controlling the host response of reservoirs. Some cytokines are broadly cross-reactive and can be used for studying reservoir responses. Recombinant house mouse GM-CSF and human IL-2 stimulate deer mouse cells [113] , and it is likely that other commercially-available cytokines can also be used. Identification of cross-reactive cytokines should be a high priority of the hantavirus community. With genome and transcriptome sequencing, many cytokine genes can be rapidly cloned into expression vectors that are codon-optimized for the expression system of choice using de novo synthesis services (e.g., GeneArt, Life Technologies). Moreover, some antibodies may be cross-reactive with reservoir species' orthologs [114] . Anti-mouse CD4 (clone GK1.5) and anti-rat CD8β (clone 341) antibodies can be used to deplete CD4 + and CD8 + T cells from hamsters, respectively [74, 86] , and they may also be useful for reservoir host studies to examine the roles of these cells.

Finally, it is difficult to assess CTL activity in reservoir hosts. Most colonies are established with wild rodents that are highly polymorphic. This limits use of traditional CTL assays that require MHC class I-matched target cells. The generation of highly inbred strains is challenging and may result in alleles that do not represent the natural biology of hantavirus infection, thus it may not be desirable to generate highly inbred rodents. It is possible to establish MHC homozygotes with controlled breeding and screening of littermates for the same haplotypes. Even then, the generation of susceptible cell lines can be problematic. While endothelial cell lines can be generated with retroviral transformation, it is possible the cells may have activated antiviral pathways that could alter in vitro CTL responses. The use of growth factors for expanding endothelial cells in culture may be more attractive. Until methods are established for generating syngeneic, susceptible target cells, assessment of CTL responses in reservoir hosts will be difficult.

The immunological relationships between hantaviruses and their rodent reservoir hosts are complex. Infection typically leads to disseminated infection within a few days but without conspicuous signs of disease. Expression of immune genes can be detected in as little as a few days that suggests innate and adaptive immune activation, but the magnitude of expression is substantially less than in hantavirus pathology models. The lack of reagents and methodologies for studying hantavirus reservoirs, most of which are not model organisms, presents a significant challenge. However, new technologies have recently emerged that are cost effective and species-independent, but which generate large amounts of data that require substantial computational and bioinformatics support for data reduction. With these tools, it should be possible to accelerate research to understand the relationships of hantaviruses and their reservoir hosts. work was provided by the Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology, Colorado State University (TS), NIH grant AI054461 (TS), and Intramural Program of NIAID, NIH (JP).

antibiotics Combating Antimicrobial Resistance in Singapore: A Qualitative Study Exploring the Policy Context, Challenges, Facilitators, and Proposed Strategies

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global public health threat that warrants urgent attention. However, the multifaceted nature of AMR often complicates the development and implementation of comprehensive policies. In this study, we describe the policy context and explore experts' perspectives on the challenges, facilitators, and strategies for combating AMR in Singapore. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 participants. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and were analyzed thematically, adopting an interpretative approach. Participants reported that the Ministry of Health (MOH) has effectively funded AMR control programs and research in all public hospitals. In addition, a preexisting One Health platform, among MOH, Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (restructured to form the Singapore Food Agency and the Animal & Veterinary Service under NParks in April 2019), National Environment Agency, and Singapore's National Water Agency, was perceived to have facilitated the coordination and formulation of Singapore's AMR strategies. Nonetheless, participants highlighted that the success of AMR strategies is compounded by various challenges such as surveillance in private clinics, resource constraints at community-level health facilities, sub-optimal public awareness, patchy regulation on antimicrobial use in animals, and environmental contamination. This study shows that the process of planning and executing AMR policies is complicated even in a well-resourced country such as Singapore. It has also highlighted the increasing need to address the social, political, cultural, and behavioral aspects influencing AMR. Ultimately, it will be difficult to design policy interventions that cater for the needs of individuals, families, and the community, unless we understand how all these aspects interact and shape the AMR response.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has gained considerable recognition as a major global public health threat [1] [2] [3] [4] . The impact of AMR has been described as a "doomsday scenario" where antibiotics can no longer be relied upon and even minor infections could become untreatable and result in severe morbidity, death and significant economic losses [1, 4, 5] . The World Health Organization (WHO) released a Global Action Plan for AMR in 2015, setting out five strategic objectives to combat AMR [2] . It also highlighted the importance of a "One Health" approach, requiring collaboration among

This qualitative study was conducted from September 2017 to May 2018. We used a purposive sampling method to recruit informants in key roles across sectors relevant to the issue of AMR in Singapore. Potential participants were identified from experts in the area of AMR in Singapore, and were approached for an in-depth interview via email explaining the purpose of research. A total of 21 participants from within and outside Singapore were recruited in this study ( Table 1) . The participants held expertise in human, animal, or environmental health and worked at either ministry, healthcare institution, academia, or civil society. Most participants were from the human health sector. We had difficulty recruiting participants from the environmental sector as potential participants showed more reservation in accepting the invitation to be interviewed, perhaps based on less knowledge about AMR. We were eventually able to recruit an academic and public health official from the environmental sector. Face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted by three of the researchers (S.R.S., S.T.T. and H.L.-Q.) in English. Among the interviewers, two were Research Associates and one was an Associate Professor. All interviewers were trained in qualitative research. The interviews were conducted in a quiet space at the preferred location of the participants. Each interview lasted an hour on average and was audio-recorded. There were no repeat interviews. A semi-structured question guide was used to explore the main areas of concern for the participants, in their fields and areas of interest. The question guide was developed with questions focusing on participants' experiences and perceptions of AMR policy and practice including awareness, key challenges and facilitators in their particular area of expertise, and possible strategies and solutions to address key challenges in the Singaporean context. Participants were not remunerated for the interview.

Ethical approval was obtained from the National University of Singapore Institutional Review Board (NUS-IRB). Each participant was provided an information sheet stating the objectives and methods of the research, at the point of recruitment. The confidentiality and anonymity of participants' responses was also highlighted. Written consent was sought before the beginning of each interview, requesting for permission to be audio-recorded and to be quoted anonymously in research outputs.

Participants could refuse any of these options, as well as any questions posed to them during the interview itself. All participants were de-identified to maintain confidentiality.

All interviews were transcribed verbatim and identifying data were removed from all research documents to ensure confidentiality. QSR NVivo 11 software was used to organize and share the data among study team members. We used an interpretive approach which focuses on the participants' perceptions and interpretations of the topic of discussion. Thematic analysis was used to inductively identify themes from the data. We drew on techniques from the constant comparative method, such as line by line analysis, naming each line and segment of data, and the use of subsequent interviews to test preliminary assumptions. In addition, deviant cases were explored and examined [20, 21] . The conduct of the interviews and coding occurred concurrently to enable the researchers to determine when theme saturation had been reached and to cease recruitment. Thematic saturation was established when the research team discussed and agreed that no new themes were emerging from the data. To improve the credibility of our findings, we conducted a member check at the final stage of manuscript preparation to validate our interpretation of the data and to ensure an accurate representation of participant perspectives. We were unable to contact a few of the participants as they have moved on to another role and their contact information was not readily available. See Supplementary Materials for the Consolidated criteria for Reporting Qualitative research checklist (COREQ form).

We present our findings under five main themes identified from analysis of participants' responses. The first theme examines the policy context and discusses whether AMR as a policy issue is a priority in Singapore. The second theme discusses the level of AMR awareness among policymakers, professionals, and the general population. The third and fourth theme discusses the perceived facilitators and challenges to combat AMR in the Singaporean context. Finally, the fifth theme reflects on the reported strategies to increase awareness and combat AMR based on participants' perceptions.

Policymakers that participated in the study reflected on the importance of addressing infectious diseases in the Singaporean context, especially after the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza which took place in 2003 and 2009, respectively. As a physician highlighted: "A lot of incidents drive behavior in Singapore, like for example SARS drove infection control to the front of everything. If you speak to some people, (they) will say infection control became prominent feature with SARS happening." -I11, Human Health

In 2009, the MOH initiated the National Antimicrobial Taskforce (NAT) that helped lay down the basics of mandatory surveillance, stewardship, and infection prevention principles in public restructured hospitals. The NAT was tasked to formulate hospital programs and policies, as well as to implement measure for monitoring and evaluation of these policies. It was later reorganized into the National Antimicrobial Resistance Control Committee (NARCC) in 2014. Participants highlighted that the strategy adopted to keep efforts sustainable was by working with people on the ground to reinforce the implementation of these programs. The MOH's knack for looking at global health issues and comparing itself to other countries also helped in funding and formulation of AMR strategies. The next quote highlights the ways in which the MOH operates including the dedicated funding for antimicrobial stewardship programs:

"The Ministry keeps an eye out for how it compares itself to other countries. So that drives their interest in looking at where we stand, how good, how bad ( . . . ) They directly fund quite a lot of the manpower in the hospital systems, certainly for antimicrobial stewardship." -I02, Human Health Participants also remarked that the ministry looked at other countries and international organizations, such as the WHO and the European Union, for inspiration and implemented policies relevant to the Singapore context.

"What WHO or even the EU is recommending, ( . . . ) I have been trying to push for that. We follow what others are doing, we don't want to reinvent the wheel, so that we can then compare ourselves." -I07, Human Health Participants credited the proactive Singaporean government with forming a One Health platform, maintaining effective communication, and coordination between the agencies. One example of this was the formulation of the National Strategic Action Plan on AMR that was released in 2017. Despite establishing a One Health platform, participants suggested that the implementation of programs against AMR would be more challenging. They stressed on the necessity of advocating the importance of AMR to raise awareness.

"Bringing different people to the table in the first instance in Singapore is easy, for somebody that is in charge ( . . . ). But at the end, ( . . . ) we need to get every single stakeholder to believe in the topic. There's a lot of sales or advocacy involved." -I12, Human Health

Most participants recounted low awareness of AMR among Singaporeans. Furthermore, AMR was identified as a recently coined term and many professionals including physicians were not familiar with the term even though they were knowledgeable of the topic itself. The next quote is an example of such reports: "I guess AMR, this phrase ( . . . ) if you were to tell me it's AMR, I would not know it's antimicrobial resistance." -I01, Human Health Participants also remarked there was low awareness of AMR both as a topic as well a term among other One Health stakeholders including farmers and others within the environmental health sector. When we contacted potential participants from the environment sector, very few agreed to be interviewed since many reported not having conducted sufficient work related to AMR. The next quote highlights the concerns expressed by an environmental health expert who was worried about the lack of awareness among his colleagues at "the ground level": "At the ground level, they were saying, "What is AMR?" People don't really know. ( . . . ) How do we address it? This is a difficult question." -I09, Environment Health Awareness was also perceived to be low in the general population as expressed by participants. Timely awareness efforts by the academic sector had not yet reached the general population. Since 2016, Singapore has been actively participating in the annual World Antibiotic Awareness Week every November, reaching out to the public at various public forums, hospitals and national libraries [22, 23] . In 2017, the MOH and Health Promotion Board organized a social campaign focusing on the general prevention of infection to fight the spread of infectious diseases such as influenza and hand, foot and mouth disease [24] . This was closely followed by a "Use Antibiotics Right" campaign with the key message that antibiotics do not work on viruses [25] . Despite these efforts many participants voiced the lack of civil society or social groups movements to support the agenda of AMR in contrast to the high HIV awareness in the early 90s. The following quote highlights the need to further develop health promotion campaigns:

"I think we need people who can inform on public policy in a way that would make our population understand. So we don't have those communication agencies. I think we have think tanks, right? And we have scientific groups. But we don't quite have that translation into a public health campaign." -I02. Human Health Some participants stated the importance of raising AMR awareness to counter its emergence. It was suggested that by raising awareness of the topic and getting more funds to drive AMR programs for the general population and stakeholders alike, AMR emergence could be tackled better.

"The community somehow must come to feel that this is an important issue. And once they do, then, you know, naturally, I think all the other pieces will fall into place. The politicians will sing the same song. The private sector will start putting money into the issue." -I06, Animal Health

Most stakeholders considered AMR a significant threat to Singapore and global health, but they also mentioned that it was not given the highest priority in the list of local healthcare challenges until several outbreaks of healthcare-associated infection changed the perception of policymakers and administrators with regards to its risk and standing. Until the early 2010s, issues such as ageing population and chronic diseases were rated much higher in priority compared to infectious diseases.

"We had this roundtable discussion. Everybody, all the movers and shakers, public health systems . . . and they were asked to state these priorities. And believe it or not, infection, the scourge of infection wasn't one of the top five." -I02, Human Health

There were many reports suggesting a lack of awareness of AMR from the public. Many participants reiterated the fact that General Practitioners (GPs) may succumb to the pressure of demanding patients to prescribe antibiotics even when they were not clinically indicated. The next quote highlights how patients are "always asking for antibiotics": "Patients will always come in and ask for antibiotics. So I think it's something that we should control and not say that it all is well and then we ignore it. But like I said ( . . . ) I think the awareness may not be strong enough for us to continue to pursue." -I01, Human Health It was also highlighted that there is a need for a firm drilling of infection prevention and control practices right in formative years of training for all healthcare professionals. Healthcare professionals needed to be more aware of and prioritize infection control, as it is not currently under "anyone's radar except for the people who do infection control": "As far as infection prevention goes, infection prevention and antimicrobial resistance is like stepchild of everyone. Because it's not in anyone's radar except for people who do infection control. So it's about making it a culture in everyone's mind, which is not an easy task." -I11, Human Health

Inadequate infrastructure to facilitate optimal infection prevention and control measures was the most commonly cited challenge in addressing AMR. Though infection prevention and control efforts were highly regulated in both the public and private hospital settings, certain contextual factors such as lack of sufficient single room facility were highly challenging to overcome. A few participants mentioned that the design of hospital wards with one room having six beds or eight beds was not conducive to prevent infections: "It's not really our fault. You are sitting here scolding us, that we have a lot of MRSA but it's because, it's not poor infection control. You are making us take care of patients in overcrowded hospitals. You know, it's very different from the US or Europe where most of their rooms are two-bedders. If you have a six-bedder, even if I wash my hands, the uncle there who has a maid, and the maid is talking to the other maid and they all share, you know . . . and it's practically, it's all crowded, all these infrastructure issues." -I04, Human Health

Overall, participants reported that guidelines and antimicrobial stewardship policies were better established in public-sector hospitals and clinics than their private counterparts. Participants attributed this to strict adherence to the guidelines in the public sector, as well as regular audits and monitoring of antibiotic prescriptions by public-sector pharmacists. The following quote is an example of the audits conducted in the public sector:

"If the pharmacy notice that the patient is coming back repeatedly with antibiotics, they will alert the senior doctor to say that they've noticed that the doctor's pattern tends to prescribe a lot of antibiotics. At the same time, we also conduct audits annually on antibiotics usage." -I01, Human Health

In contrast, it was reported that private hospitals gave less priority to funding for infection control and stewardship policies than public hospitals. The stewardship element was not strictly monitored in the private hospitals and clinics, where it was reported that the MOH does not have so much leverage. This was raised as a concern by some physicians and policymakers when discussing the extension of AMR policies to the private sector:

"I feel, in the restructured setting, you know, it's much more, I wouldn't say easier may not be the word, but maybe less challenging because it's much more homogenous within that institution and you only have to work in your institution whereas we have to work across all these little and then we are spending a lot of time and cracking ourselves in bits and pieces whereas it can all be done, you know, under one, I think, more harmonization, less bickering, less fighting, and then we can get more funding." -I18, Human Health

Many participants mentioned that there were practical difficulties in being able to perform adequate tests before dispensing or prescribing antibiotics. Hence physicians and veterinarians tended to practice defensive medicine by prescribing broad-spectrum antibiotics.

"If you are not following the stories in Singapore, it's not too long ago, you notice that the doctors have been held a lot in, they are being suspended for not diagnosing a certain condition ( . . . ) So, if you are going to hide under the umbrella of stewardship, are they going to get bailed out? Is someone going to come and rescue them, you know? Pertinent questions. It's not that people want to practice defense medicine, but that is somehow being construed or misconstrued from what is happening out there." -I18, Human Health Moreover, veterinarians emphasized that the high diagnostics costs were difficult to justify to pet owners as the next quote exemplifies:

"Textbook always tells us to do so (diagnostics) before you start on any medication. But, in a practical sense, hard to because how do I explain $60 more on top of what they are already paying, for them to get a culture and sensitivity back before we give antibiotics?" -I17, Animal Health

Stakeholders differed on their take as to what contributes more to AMR and ultimately which policy may help in reducing it. Physicians reported being aware of the importance of antimicrobial stewardship policies and infection prevention measures to control AMR, but were unsure if these programs alone could alleviate AMR since they believed that AMR could also be generated by antimicrobial use in animal farming as growth promoters. On the contrary, animal health experts believed the animal food industry did not contribute much to the growing resistance since the volume of antimicrobial used over the lifespan of livestock was very low. As reported by an animal health expert:

"Even though the vets use a huge volume of antibiotic in farming, I think the quantity used per animal over a period of time is way less than what we can get from human clinics. Way, way less." -I17, Animal Health 3.3.6. Need to Address the Prevention of AMR outside the Human Health Sector Many participants also expressed that AMR in Singapore had so far only been addressed in the hospital sector and not much had been done regarding the prevention of AMR in the animal and environment health domains. It was also mentioned that within NAT most of its members and emphasis was still focused on the hospital sector:

"It was still very much hospital-focused. The membership (in the National Antimicrobial Taskforce) still basically comprised representatives of every public-sector hospital, and the chairman and the members were still very much concerned about preventing the spread of AMR organisms in hospitals." -I07, Human Health

Environmental health stakeholders expressed the potential of AMR emergence from farms, the community, and the environment as a whole. In general, the perception was that Singapore has not established strategies to deal with environmental contamination. Untreated effluents from hospitals was noted to serve as one of the potential threats in case of a sewage leak.

"The primary source for us ( . . . ) is, of course, our hospitals, also hospital effluents. We know that there are very high concentrations of all these last resort antibiotics, especially from the ICUs (Intensive Care Units) and all that, and it gets into the wastewater which then goes into the sewerage system, all the way to the wastewater treatment plant." -I14, Environment Health Also, there was a scope for improving the wastewater treatment standard to treat some antibiotic residues so that they do not harbor AMR.

"Even if you look at the wastewater treatment plants, they're not doing so well in removing all the pharmaceuticals, all the antibiotics. Some can be removed very well, but some cannot. And so, that means they will be discharged and be effluent." -I14, Environment Health Participants reported that antimicrobial laced water leeching in the environment served as breeding sites for AMR as the next quote emphasizes:

"At the treatment end, there's no problem because their treatment process is rigorous enough to remove all these bugs and all that . . . But, of course, I think it's more from the environmental leakage (of antibiotics)." -I09, Environment Health

In addition to the above factors, participants also hinted on the vested interest of different stakeholders. For example, it was mentioned that private practitioners make substantial profits when dispensing antibiotics as it added to their income.

"And by dispensing (antibiotics) they (GPs) are also getting the profits. So, there is already a misaligned incentive." -I04, Human Health Also, some participants reflected on the vested interests of pharmaceutical companies in marketing for higher sales of their antibiotics for their own profits. "There is a conflict of interest already, because, they (pharmaceuticals) are producing, they are just selling to the farmers ( . . . ) in a way they are trying to encourage certain resistance." -I17, Animal Health Animal health stakeholders expressed that the not so strict regulations on the import of newer antibiotics with a broader spectrum of activity served as a leeway for some veterinarians to prescribe them even when not clinically needed. Participants pointed out that the abuse of reserved antibiotics favored acquisition of resistance genes by microorganisms, resulting in loss of antibiotic efficacy.

"There are those not very good ones out in the market that actually goes for the most exotic antibiotics because they distinguish themselves in that sense. Some of them actually use what I call the third-level antibiotic as a first line treatment which I personally don't agree. Of course, they charge exorbitant amount because it's 'special' antibiotics." -I17, Animal Health

In addition, owing to a small farming sector, existing veterinarians had limited expertise in agriculture and aquaculture and hence farmers in Singapore were not mandated to attain prescription for accessing antibiotics independently. Participants alluded that farmers not needing to consult a veterinarian for a prescription for antibiotics served in the farmer's interest.

"Vets were not familiar to treat fish, so farmers didn't trust the vets to treat their fish, and vets then became very unwilling to treat farm fish. That's not changed very much, and there are still issues in Singapore. For example, fish farmers can now buy any antibiotic they want by themselves." -I15, Animal Health

Singapore's MOH was unanimously praised by all participants in its proactive approach towards AMR and making way for changes amid very complex issues. It was mentioned that the MOH was transparent and accountable and was operating an efficient public healthcare system in Singapore. Yet, as a drawback some participants argued that having a system that relies too much on decisions made at the highest political level makes the general population and service providers inert.

"That's why I think in Singapore, unless it comes directly from the Prime Minister's office, it will never move anything." -I11, Human Health

In terms of the resources made available to fund AMR programs, it was reported that MOH had effectively funded AMR control programs and research in all public hospitals.

Most participants affirmed that the Singaporean population and healthcare professionals bestow trust in government programs and policies. The next quote highlights that whether participants agreed or not with the proposed policy, there was a sense that the government is "trying to do a good thing": "When the Singaporean government gets into doing something, they tend to do it very thoroughly. ( . . . ) You may not always agree with the strategy, but you have to give them full marks for trying." -I04, Human Health

In addition, a preexisting One Health platform among MOH, SFA, AVS, NEA, and PUB was perceived to have facilitated the coordination and formulation of Singapore's AMR strategies.

Laying the foundation of surveillance in public hospitals and making the data transparent was appreciated by all participants. Participants also shared recent advances in the capacity to implement stewardship and infection prevention and control policies among different Singapore institutions including nursing homes.

"We are looking to reaching out to even nursing homes to provide that kind of bold infection prevention, but also infection control." -I03, Human Health

AMR indicators, segregated mainly into process and outcome indicators, were set up in the public hospital surveillance system. Some of the process indicators were antimicrobial use for human and animal health, and infection prevention and control measures such as hand hygiene in hospitals. It was suggested that the Singapore government played a prime role in mandating the standardization, transparency, and sharing of data with the NAT. The motivation of the workforce was attributed to the competition, prestige, and reputation of the workforce. In the hospital setting, metrics and outcomes of antimicrobial stewardship such as average defined daily dose and percentage of appropriate antibiotics prescribed, and length of hospitalization for each department are often reported and shared among the various departments within the hospital. The transparency of data highly motivated the workforce to perform well in these benchmarking exercises. The following quote is an example of such occurrence: "More important I think is the peer pressure and peer standing. And when it's made the department target and communicated by the head of the department, no one wants to be the worst department in the stats when they are shown up. So there's lot of department pride and that's what drives stuff. Doctors are often competitive, some of the nurses too. And no one wants to be the idiot that lets the team down." -I03, Human Health

Research in Singapore was unanimously considered to be well promoted and funded, albeit it was also rated to be very competitive in terms of securing research funding. There was ongoing AMR research including in the areas of surveillance, prevention of transmission, whole genome sequencing, among others. Of the various arms of AMR research, surveillance was considered to be one of the main pillars in AMR research: "One of the key reasons in the national action plan is research. And among the research activities there have been sort of highlighted in terms of priority, is better surveillance. You know, how to better measure the different perspectives and areas that we need to, outside the hospitals: primary care, the community and understanding the sort of pathways of antibiotic resistances, what is driving, the drivers of antibiotic resistance locally . . . " -I07, Human Health

The researcher and academic participants mentioned that the government and ministry were very tightly knit in Singapore. Leadership was very open and attentive to research findings that could be translated into better health practices in Singapore. As the following quote highlights: "There's that translation angle number one. There is the One Health angle number two, and then of course number three we also engage with basic science collaborators, to try to understand the basic science mechanisms of this issue." -I08, Human Health 3.4.8. Role of Singapore in Regional AMR As AMR is a global health issue, participants remarked that Singapore alone could do very little in controlling AMR as a whole. Despite all policies Singapore will not be untouched by rising AMR in the region which can be ultimately transmitted via large imports of agricultural products and humans travelling for trade and tourism. However, most participants mentioned that Singapore could play a role by coordinating and sharing expertise with neighboring member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

Many participants proposed the idea that Singapore can serve as a research hub owing to its unique positioning and research capacity. Sharing innovative findings both on science, clinical practice and exemplary policy implementation strategies could prove helpful to neighboring countries that share some contextual factors with Singapore.

"It is an ideal geographic position as well as possibly a good political one with the recognition by the west that Singapore is a high-income country as well as intellectually advanced. That bridge between the west and low-and middle-income countries especially in the Asia Pacific region could really be bridged by your university and your researchers." -I20, Human Health A few ministerial participants affirmed Singapore's role of coordinating regional efforts on AMR.

"What Singapore is trying to do is trying to harmonize efforts in the agriculture sector and the livestock sector because these are under different ASEAN stream workgroups. So we also work with FAO to coordinate these." -I13, Animal Health

Participants articulated that highlighting the increasing cost of managing patients infected with resistant organisms and the economic loss from AMR could be a potential way of drawing attention to the topic and getting funds to drive programs. As specific examples, participants illustrated not just the costs of treating resistant infections, but also the costs associated with implementing stricter infection control measures.

Some participants believed that healthcare costs would increase due to AMR. These were attributed to many reasons, one of which was the cost of more effective antibiotics required to treat infections with resistant organisms. Another prominent reason mentioned was the costs towards infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. This was considered a necessary step to reduce the risk of healthcare-associated infections, especially in the face of worsening AMR. The following factors were suggested by one participant to prevent the spread of resistant pathogens and to cater to patients harboring resistant or infectious organisms: "That is going to jack up costs in all kinds of ways. Number 1, you are going to have to pay for all those gowns, gloves, single rooms, for isolation, etc. Number 2 you need more manpower, because suddenly a nurse is going to be slowed down right? Or a doctor. You have to put on all this gear, you are going to be seeing fewer patients in the same amount of time, just because of . . . it's a bother." -I04, Human Health

Many participants believed that unless AMR's potential damage to the population and the economy is projected, people are not going to take AMR seriously. Some participants mentioned that only a grave incident such as an AMR outbreak would be able to catch the attention of the general public and extend the prevention efforts of AMR.

A few participants articulated that rather than forcing a top-down policy approach, AMR could be better tackled by the sharing of best practices through communities of practitioners and creating social movements to encourage and sustain behavior change.

"Practitioners come together to share best practices, through the ID networks, through the hospital networks, through the volunteer networks, you know, build communities of practice until this becomes a culture. And people are learning from each other ( . . . ) But whether it gets done is a question of culture, a culture needs strategy every day ( . . . ) so you want to do change, and you want to do large scale change and you want to sustain the change you need to create a movement not a directive . . . I think it's more important to you to create the social movement around what that is, because if you are going to achieve this style change of behavior you need a more behavioral approach to this problem not a clinical approach." -I05, Human Health

Participants reflected on the need to develop public campaigns to sensitize people to become aware of and understand the fundamentals of programs and strategies against AMR. These include stewardship, adherence to vaccination guidelines, better infection prevention and control practices in hospitals as well as programs in the community. All these programs needed to take into account social, behavioral, and cultural aspects to accommodate the needs and perceptions of the community. "There is always a need to build a culture and to build a system for people to do the right thing. And the same applies outside the hospitals. So I think you know the schools have hand washing to teach the next generation." -I05, Human Health

Most participants asserted that one of the probable strategies to counter AMR was to increase vaccination rates in children and adult population. However, increasing vaccination uptake will uncover another set of issues including population awareness, behavior changes, funding for regular vaccination, workforce to administer vaccination, and availability of vaccines.

This paper has discussed the challenges and facilitators to addressing AMR in a well-resourced setting such as Singapore. Despite Singapore having an established One Health platform representing all the different stakeholders; appropriate funding to address the response; existence of stewardship and surveillance programs in public hospitals; an active program in research; and a motivated workforce; most participants raised several challenges to address AMR efficiently. These included, among other, vested interests among some stakeholders; disagreements between the human and animal health sectors; low public awareness; the need to address prevention of AMR in the animal and environmental sector; political and cultural aspects influencing AMR; and lax stewardship policies in the private sector.

Therefore, the results of this paper highlight how difficult it can be to address AMR, especially when considering that Singapore has well-functioning stewardship programs, comprehensive hospital surveillance systems, and some of the latest technologies and innovations to address it. The example of AMR in Singapore brings to light the increasing need to address the social, economic, political, cultural, and behavioral aspects influencing AMR rather than just focusing on the technical solutions. Unless we understand how all these aspects operate and drive the response, it will be difficult to design appropriate policy interventions. In the next paragraphs we provide an example of each of these aspects to highlight their importance in the Singaporean setting. We address "the social" by analyzing how AMR has been socially constructed in Singapore; we discuss the influence of "politics" by considering power relations and governance approaches for the successful control of AMR; we address "behavioral aspects" by analyzing vested interests; and we consider "cultural components" by exploring how patients' cultural beliefs influence antibiotic consumption.

First, it is important to understand how AMR has been socially constructed in Singapore and how power relations operate between the different stakeholders. Wernli et al. distinguished five different frames that map the global policy discourse on AMR [26] . These are: a One Health approach combining in one paradigm human, animal, and environment health; a health security threat giving rise to the global health security agenda; a healthcare policy issue with the dominance of the medical profession; a development issue where it is considered that low-and-middle income countries drive AMR; and an innovation issue with a focus on new diagnostics and antibiotics. Wernli et al. also distinguish a set of actors and policies for each of the frames described. In the Singaporean context, it is interesting to note that several frames coexist with their respective actors leading the selected frame. First, it was reported that there is a One Health platform where all stakeholders meet. Second, there is a strong healthcare policy frame as it was reported that Singapore's AMR policies were largely driven by a group of infectious disease clinicians. Third, AMR is also seen as an innovation issue where researchers are working to identify novel solutions on all fronts. The results of this study suggest that a deeper understanding is needed of the different power relations between these distinct groups to ensure the successful implementation of policies designed to respond to the threat of resistance. However, from our participants' responses we can tentatively conclude that AMR is predominantly seen as a biomedical problem within the context of healthcare facilities and within the pursuit of clinicians controlling infectious diseases even when they still participate in the One Health platform. It could also be argued that historically the emphasis on AMR has been biomedical because this is where the health burden was seen and therefore where the expertise developed. This, however, does not mean that other areas are not seen as important.

Second, considering governance approaches for the successful control of AMR requires a focus on both whole of society and sector specific approaches [19] . This was detailed in a previous paper where we proposed a new governance framework to investigate power relations and responses for diverse stakeholders addressing AMR [19] . As Kickbusch mentioned, and further discussed in our paper, recently there has been a diffusion of governance moving from a model dominated by the state to a model co-produced by a wide range of actors [27] . As a result, Kickbusch has identified five types of governance present in whole-of-government approaches. These include: (1) governing among others by mixing regulation and persuasion; (2) by collaborating; (3) by engaging citizens;

(4) through independent agencies and expert bodies; (5) and by adaptive policies, resilient structures, and foresight.

In the Singapore setting, many participants highlighted the leading role of the MOH in regulating the health sector, but acknowledged challenges in regulating the private and animal health sector. These challenges present examples where governance structures will need to weigh up the balance between regulation and persuasion as policy approaches. In the Singaporean context, differential policies in the public and private human healthcare sectors, whether by design or practice, are likely to be counterproductive, as patients use both sectors and the occurrence of resistant infections in one sector has implications for the other. On the other hand, the agricultural sector in Singapore is small and the availability of adequate veterinary expertise limited; imposing tight regulations on antibiotic access in the absence of qualified prescribers is therefore challenging, and persuasive strategies to reduce antibiotic use in this sector are likely to be more realistic, at least in the short term. On their collaborative approach towards governance, many participants highlighted the One Health platform as a good way of bringing stakeholders together. The good relationship between researchers and policymakers was also emphasized via the many avenues for researchers to discuss and share their research findings and discuss policy implications with policymakers. However, there were also conflicts reported specifically between human and animal health experts. This was crystalized on their different takes on what contributes more to AMR. Most physicians believed that antimicrobial use in animal farming as growth promoters might be a more significant driver of AMR, as has been explained by studies [28] . In contrast, animal health experts believed the animal food industry did not contribute much to the growing resistance when compared to AMR infection rates in the health sector. Finally, governing AMR through the engagement of citizens and civil society was not reported as a strategy in Singapore. However, this is not unique to Singapore, as it is well recognized that globally there has been a lack of engagement of civil society organizations in addressing AMR, especially when comparing and contrasting to the high HIV involvement in the early 90s.

Third, the AMR policy context represents a policy arena where certain groups engage in "behaviors" that might conflict with the overall goal of controlling AMR. Vested interests are more noticeable than in other health policy areas since different professional groups coexist in the AMR policy arena and there is substantial profit to be made from selling antibiotics [29, 30] . In Singapore, vested interests were mentioned among pharmaceutical companies in marketing for higher sales of their antibiotics for their own profits; among private practitioners as they make substantial profits when dispensing antibiotics; and among some veterinarians who prescribed antibiotics even when not clinically needed. Our previous research in other settings (i.e., Pakistan and Cambodia) also suggested several considerations and vested interests around antibiotic use which can hinder the control of AMR in the human and animal health sectors [29, 30] . For example, it was reported that among doctors there are monetary incentives to prescribe certain antibiotics as these are often negotiated with pharmaceutical companies. It was also recounted that a large proportion of the income at hospital level and in pharmacies comes from prescribing antibiotics and as a result it might be difficult to introduce stewardship programs to curb their prescription. While these reports were present in Cambodia and Pakistan, they were absent in Singapore. Monetary incentives were not mentioned that often by our participants and were absent at hospital level.

Fourth, many participants reported that "cultural aspects" and perception regarding medication influenced patients' requests for antibiotics, with patients requesting them, and GPs recognizing feeling the pressure to prescribe them. Other research has found similar findings, with Lam et al. observing that primary healthcare physicians over-prescribed antibiotics in order to satisfy their patients [31] . There were also reports suggesting a lack of awareness of AMR from the public and as a result, patients continued demanding antibiotics even when they were not clinically indicated. This was also reported in a Singaporean study that surveyed patients and found that most patients seeking primary health care in Singapore were misinformed about the role of antibiotics, with poor knowledge being associated with wanting antibiotics [32] .

To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to explore the social, political, behavioral, and cultural aspects influencing AMR in a well-resourced setting. A key strength of this study is that we were able to gather the perspectives of multiple stakeholders in the human, animal, and environmental sector. However, we had difficulty in recruiting participants from the environmental sector, and we were only able to interview two participants. A limitation of this study is that participants could have downplayed some of the challenges and some strategies that are considered key to address AMR could have been missed. For example, the fact that Singapore has a well-functioning system for dispensing antibiotics in the human sector, with antibiotics only available with a physician's prescription, was not mentioned as often as a facilitator as one might expect. This could be the case because it was already taken for granted as it has been in existence for several years.

Finally, participants in this study were asked to describe the most important strategies to combat AMR and to raise awareness among the population. The most often mentioned responses were: the need to project AMR costs to draw more attention to the topic; pushing forward the AMR agenda by fear of no treatment; creating a community of practice; considering the social aspects of AMR in order to develop prevention efforts against AMR; engaging the community and public campaigns on the drivers of AMR; and increasing vaccination rates in children and adult population. One important step to realizing these strategies would be to have good quality data obtained from standardized surveillance platforms at the national level. This will allow the conduct of outcome research, which can eventually be translated into messages to increase awareness and to push forward the AMR agenda. For example, Naylor et al. used a national mandatory surveillance database in England to quantify the cost and mortality burden of Escherichia coli bacteremia, as well as the influence different resistances have on them. Such findings will be useful for understanding the health and economic impact of future trends in resistance, and for prioritization of funding and strategies to tackle the problem [33] . In addition, future research could focus on exploring further how the current Singapore National Strategic Action Plan is being implemented; exploring in more detail the social, political, behavioral and cultural components affecting AMR; and analyzing at greater length what type of AMR awareness campaigns could be developed to reach the community and engage civil society organizations.

The process of designing and implementing AMR policies is complicated even in a country such as Singapore, which has dedicated funding and has developed a multisectoral approach to address AMR. This paper has highlighted the increasing need to address the social, political, cultural, and behavioral aspects influencing AMR rather than just focusing on the technical solutions. Unless we understand how all these aspects operate and drive the response, it will be difficult to design policy interventions that produce the desired results and that cater for the needs of individuals, families, and the community as a whole. 

Cullin4 Is Pro-Viral during West Nile Virus Infection of Culex Mosquitoes

Although mosquitoes serve as vectors of many pathogens of public health importance, their response to viral infection is poorly understood. It also remains to be investigated whether viruses deploy some mechanism to be able to overcome this immune response. Here, we have used an RNA-Seq approach to identify differentially regulated genes in Culex quinquefasciatus cells following West Nile virus (WNV) infection, identifying 265 transcripts from various cellular pathways that were either upregulated or downregulated. Ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway genes, comprising 12% of total differentially regulated genes, were selected for further validation by real time RT-qPCR and functional analysis. It was found that treatment of infected cells with proteasomal inhibitor, MG-132, decreased WNV titers, indicating importance of this pathway during infection process. In infection models, the Culex ortholog of mammalian Cul4A/B (cullin RING ubiquitin ligase) was found to be upregulated in vitro as well as in vivo, especially in midguts of mosquitoes. Gene knockdown using dsRNA and overexpression studies indicated that Culex Cul4 acts as a pro-viral protein by degradation of CxSTAT via ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. We also show that gene knockdown of Culex Cul4 leads to activation of the Jak-STAT pathway in mosquitoes leading to decrease viral replication in the body as well as saliva. Our results suggest a novel mechanism adopted by WNV to overcome mosquito immune response and increase viral replication.

Mosquitoes are responsible for transmitting a large number of human and livestock viruses, like West Nile, dengue and Japanese encephalitis viruses. Infection of female mosquitoes with these viruses during blood feeding elicits an immune response. It is not known how the viruses manage to replicate in spite of this antiviral response. We used an unbiased transcriptome sequencing approach to identify genes differentially regulated after WNV infection resulting in 265 transcripts from various cellular pathways. Ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway, responsible for protein degradation, was found to be important during viral infection in mosquito cells. Using in vitro and in vivo infection models, we identified Culex Cul4 to be acting as pro-viral protein, increasing viral titers. Knockdown of Cul4 in Culex mosquitoes decreased viral titers in mosquito saliva. Identification of this novel immune evasion mechanism adopted by WNV provides new insights into transmission of arbovirus and interaction of WNV with its mosquito vector. host immunity, by degradation of immune proteins. For example, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) immediate-early transcription factor RTA encodes ubiquitin E3 ligase activity that targets IRF7, a key mediator of type I interferon induction, for proteasome-mediated degradation [27] . As an alternate strategy, viruses also encode adaptors that recruit and redirect host E3 ligases to ubiquitylate host proteins, leading to degradation. Adenoviruses express proteins which recruit a cullin-based E3 ligase to target p53 for degradation [28] . Several paramyxoviruses limit the activity of interferons by targeting STATs for ubiquitylation and degradation via interaction of their highly conserved V proteins and host Cul4A RING E3 ligase [29, 30] .

Here we use an unbiased approach of transcriptome analysis by deep sequencing of the Culex cell transcriptome to identify genes that are differentially regulated following WNV infection. The results show multiple cellular pathways are involved during infection. Using mosquito infection studies in vitro and in vivo, we determine that the ubiquitin-proteasomal system plays a major role during WNV infection in mosquitoes. We also show that Culex cullin (orthologous to mammalian Cul4A/B) is induced by WNV infection and blocks Jak-STAT signalling, increasing WNV replication.

Hsu cells (Culex quinquefasciatus cell line) were infected with WNV (NY99-4132 strain) at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 and total RNA was collected at 48 h post-infection (hpi) for high-throughput transcriptome sequencing as given in Methods. The experiment was conducted in duplicate and since Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.994 (control) and 0.991 (WNV) indicated close agreement between the biological replicates (S1 Table) , data from the replicates was combined for further analysis. The raw sequencing and downstream files were deposited at NCBI with accession code GSE60229.

A total of 265 unique transcripts were identified as differentially accumulated (>2-fold) between control and WNV-infected cells, with 130 transcripts up-regulated and 135 transcripts down-regulated after infection (S2 Table) . Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, www.ingenuity.com) performed on all differentially regulated genes indicated that various pathways and cellular processes were involved during infection, including the immune signalling, the cell-cycle/apoptosis and proteasomal pathways, metabolism genes and the cell transport machinery ( Fig 1A) . Transcripts, which could not be functionally annotated were grouped as other or unknown. Genes in the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway comprised 12% of differentially regulated transcripts and were selected for further analysis. To validate the RNA-Seq analysis, the relative abundance of seven differentially up-regulated transcripts in the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway was determined by real-time RT-qPCR using target-specific primers. The results confirmed that all of the transcripts were up-regulated during infection but the fold-increase was consistently overestimated by RNA-Seq analysis (Fig 1B) .

Previous studies have shown that ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway plays an important role in mammalian cells during flavivirus infection [25, 31] . Studies have also shown that ubiquitinrelated genes are upregulated following bacterial infection in mosquito cells [32] . Experiments were performed to determine the significance of the proteasomal pathway in WNV infected Culex cells. Hsu cells were pretreated with 0.1, 1 or 10 μM MG132 (specific proteasomal inhibitor) from 1 h prior to WNV infection (MOI 10), and supernatant media and total RNA from cells were collected at 48 hpi. Real-time RT-qPCR using primers specific for WNV NS1 gene Pathway (molecular and cellular function) analysis was performed for all differentially expressed genes using Ingenuity software. The results are represented here as a pie-chart to indicate the contribution of major cellular pathways during WNV infection. B. Hsu cells were infected with WNV and total RNA was collected at 48 hpi. Cells were mock-infected as controls. Real-time RT-qPCR was performed using primers for ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway genes found to be differentially regulated in the RNA-Seq screen. RpL32 (ribosomal protein L32) primers were used as an showed a dose-dependent decrease in viral replication, with the NS1 RNA level reducing by more than 80% following treatment with 10 μM MG132 (Fig 2A) . Cell viability assay showed no significant toxicity for MG132 at concentrations used in the assay (S1 Fig). Plaque assays internal control. The graph was plotted as fold-increase over control (set arbitrarily at 1, not included). Error bars represent standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate. The results from the RNA-Seq experiment were also plotted on the graph for comparison. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1005143.g001

The proteasomal pathway is important during WNV infection. A. Hsu cells were pre-treated with MG132 at various concentrations (0.1, 1, 10 μM) for 1 h prior to WNV infection. Total RNA and supernatant medium were collected at 48 hpi. Real-time RT-qPCR was performed using WNV NS1 primers. RpL32 primers were used as an internal control. Error bars represent standard errors from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate (Student's t-test *p < 0.05, comparing between control and MG132 treated cells). B. Viral titer estimation by plaque assays conducted on the supernatant media from cells treated as in A. Error bars represents standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate (Student's t-test *p < 0.05 compared to control). C. Hsu cells were pre-treated with MG132 at various concentrations (0.1, 1, 10 μM) for 1 h prior to infection with WNV at 4°C. Cells were moved to 30°C and total RNA was collected at 6 hpi. Real-time RT-qPCR was performed using WNV NS1 primers. RpL32 primers were used as an internal control. Error bars represent standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate (Student's t-test *p < 0.05, comparing between control and MG132 treated cells). D. Hsu cells were infected with WNV, followed by treatment with 10 μM MG132 at 2, 4 or 6 hpi. Total RNA was collected at 48 hpi and real-time RT-qPCR was performed using WNV NS1 primers. RpL32 primers were used as an internal control. Error bars represents standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate (Student's t-test *p < 0.05, comparing between control and MG132-treated cells). performed on the supernatant media showed a similar dose-dependent decrease in viral titers, with a 20-fold reduction in cells treated with 10 μM MG132 (30 pfu/ml) compared to untreated controls (600 pfu/ml) (Fig 2B) . These results suggest the proteasomal pathway is required for efficient WNV replication in Culex cells.

The proteasomal pathway plays an important role post-viral entry A previous report suggests the proteasomal pathway has a role during entry of WNV into mammalian cells [25] . To test this in the mosquito system, Hsu cells were pre-treated with MG132 at various concentrations (0.1, 1 and 10 μM), infected with WNV (MOI 10) at 4°C for 30 min and then incubated at 30°C. Real-time RT-qPCR using NS1 primers conducted on total RNA from cells collected at 6 hpi showed no significant effect of MG132 treatment, indicating that the proteasome does not play a role during WNV entry to Culex cells (Fig 2C) . To determine whether the proteasomal pathway plays significant role post-entry, cells were infected with WNV and treated with 10 μM MG132 from 2, 4, or 6 hpi. Real-time RT-qPCR using NS1 primers conducted on total RNA from cells collected at 48 hpi showed~80% reduction in viral RNA in all treated samples ( Fig 2D) . Experiments were also performed to rule out significant contribution by extracellular viral RNA in real time RT-qPCR results (S2 Fig). These results suggest involvement of the proteasomal pathway post-viral entry, possibly during viral transcription.

Amongst the differentially expressed genes in the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway, CPIJ010574 was highly up-regulated (>20-fold in RNA-Seq and >12-fold in real-time RT-qPCR) following WNV infection in Culex cells (Fig 1B and S2 Table) . CPIJ010574 is orthologous to mammalian Cullin4A and Cullin 4B (~70% amino acid identity with both) (S3 Fig) and is therefore referred to here as CxCul4. Cullin-RING ligases, such as Cullin4A, have been found to be upregulated during WNV infection of mammalian cells and implicated in various cellular processes such cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, DNA replication as well as viral replication [33] . Initially, in vivo validation of RNA-Seq analysis was performed using a mosquito infection model. Female Culex annulirostris mosquitoes were infected with WNV (NY99-4132 strain) by blood-feeding. Total RNA was collected from whole carcasses and dissected midguts at 24 hpi. Real-time RT-qPCR performed using CxCul4-specific primers showed approximately 4-and 12-fold increases in mRNA in carcass and midgut, respectively, compared with control mosquitoes fed on uninfected blood ( Fig 3A) .

Gene knock-down experiments were conducted to determine the significance of CxCul4 during WNV infection. Hsu cells were transfected with long dsRNA against CxCul4, infected with WNV at 24 h post-transfection, and total RNA and supernatant media were collected at 48 hpi. As a control, cells were either left untransfected (No dsRNA) or were transfected with dsRNA against GFP (GFP dsRNA). Real-time RT-qPCR showed a significant decrease (>80%) in CxCul4 mRNA, indicating efficient knock-down of the gene (S4 Fig). There was also a significant decrease (>75%) in WNV NS1 RNA in cells treated with CxCul4 dsRNA, indicating a decrease in viral replication, compared to control (No dsRNA and GFP dsRNA) cells (Fig 3B) . Plaque assays conducted on supernatant media showed greater than 10-fold decrease in viral titers following CxCul4 knock-down (75 pfu/ml) compared with No dsRNA (900 pfu/ml) and GFP dsRNA (800 pfu/ml) (Fig 3C) . In a parallel experiment, western blots performed using Culex cullin (Cul4) is pro-viral. A. Female Culex annulirostris mosquitoes (n = 40) were infected with WNV by blood feeding. Mosquitoes were microdissected at 24 hpi and total RNA was collected from the midgut and the remaining carcass. Real-time RT-qPCR was performed using Culex cullin (Cul4) primers. RpL32 primers were used as an internal control. Error bars represent standard error from four pooled mosquitoes with assays performed in triplicate (Student's t-test *p < 0.05, comparing between control and WNV-infected carcasses and midguts). B. Hsu cells were transfected with dsRNA against Culex cullin (Cul4 dsRNA). No dsRNA or GFP dsRNA was used as a silencing control. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were infected with WNV and total RNA was collected 48 hpi. Real-time RT-qPCR was performed using WNV NS1-specific primers. RpL32 primers were used as internal control. Error bars represent standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate (*p < 0.05, comparing between No dsRNA, GFP dsRNA and Cul4-knock-down cells). C. Viral titer estimation by plaque assays conducted on the supernatant media collected from cells treated as in B. D. Western blot anti-NS5 antibody showed a significantly lower level of WNV NS5 in cells treated with CxCul4 dsRNA compared with control cells (GFP dsRNA) (Fig 3D) .

To further investigate the role of CxCul4, Hsu cells were transfected with a plasmid containing CxCul4 cloned under insect promoter (OpIE2), infected with WNV at 24 h post-transfection, and total RNA and supernatant media were collected at 48 hpi. Real-time RT-qPCR showed increased WNV NS1 levels (>4-fold) in cells transfected with CxCul4 compared with empty vector (Control), indicating increased viral replication (Fig 3E) . Plaque assays conducted on supernatant media also showed significantly increased viral titer (> 10-fold) in cells over-expressing CxCul4 compared with control cells (Fig 3F) . In a parallel experiment, western blots using V5 antibody was performed on total cell lysates collected from Hsu cells transfected with CxCul4 to confirm exogenous expression level of CxCul4 ( Fig 3G) . Combined, the above data suggest that CxCul4 plays a significant pro-viral role during WNV infection.

Previous reports have shown that mammalian Cul4A plays a role in degradation of STAT2 by an ubiquitin-proteasomal-dependent pathway. To determine whether CxCul4 plays a similar role during WNV infection, Hsu cells were transfected with plasmid expressing CxCul4 and infected with WNV 24 h post-transfection. Total RNA was collected 48 hpi and real-time RT-qPCR was performed using primers for Vir1, a reporter gene regulated by Jak-STAT pathway [34] , and CxVago, a reporter gene regulated by the TRAF-Rel2 pathway [35] . As expected, expression of both CxVir1 and CxVago was upregulated following WNV infection. However, whilst there was no significant difference in CxVago expression following CxCul4 overexpression, CxVir1 upregulation was suppressed significantly in CxCul4-overexpressing cells compared with empty vector transfected cells ( Fig 4A) . Previous studies have shown that, once expressed, CxVago is secreted and activates the Jak-STAT pathway in Culex cells [7] . Therefore, Hsu cells were transfected with CxVago and the supernatant medium was collected 72 h post-transfection. Fresh Hsu cells were then transfected with the CxCul4 overexpression plasmid and, at 24 h post-transfection, the medium was replaced with medium containing CxVago to activate the Jak-STAT pathway. Real-time RT-qPCR conducted on total RNA collected 48 h after media replacement showed expression of CxVir1 was upregulated in control (empty vector transfected) cells but upregulation of CxVir1 was suppressed significantly in cells overexpressing CxCul4 (Fig 4B) . These results indicate that CxCul4 functions to inhibit the Jak-STAT pathway in Culex cells.

To further confirm that CxCul4 is a negative regulator of Jak-STAT pathway, Hsu cells were transfected with a plasmid (p6x2DRAF-Luc) containing a Firefly luciferase reporter gene under Drosophila STAT-responsive elements, along with dsRNA against CxCul4. After 24 h, cells were infected with WNV and luciferase activity was measured 16 hpi. The results showed that CxCul4 knockdown resulted in increased luciferase activity in WNV-infected cells using anti-WNV NS5 and anti-β-actin antibodies conducted on lysates collected from cells treated as in B. Molecular weight markers represented as kDa. The band at around 95 kDa is expected size of WNV-NS5; while band at 191 kDa is non-specific. E. Hsu cells were transfected with Culex Cul4 overexpression plasmid. Empty vector (Control) was used as a transfection control. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were infected with WNV and cell lysates were collected at 48 hpi. Total RNA was collected from cells and real-time RT-qPCR was performed using WNV NS1-specific primers. RpL32 primers were used as an internal control. Error bars represent standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate (Student's t-test *p < 0.05, comparing between control and Cul4-transfected cells). F. Viral titer estimation by plaque assays conducted on the supernatant media collected from cells treated as in E. G. Hsu cells were transfected with Culex Cul4 overexpression plasmid. Empty vector (Empty) was used as a transfection control. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were infected with WNV and cell lysates were collected at 48 hpi. Western blot was performed using anti-V5 (detecting CxCul4 overexpression) and anti-β-actin antibodies. Molecular weight markers represented as kDa. Culex cullin (Cul4) blocks the Jak-STAT pathway. A. Hsu cells were transfected with plasmid overexpressing Culex cullin (CxCul4). Empty vector (Control) was used as transfection control. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were infected with WNV and total RNA was collected at 48 hpi. Real-time RT-qPCR was performed using Culex Vir1-specific and Culex Vago-specific primers. RpL32 primers were used as an internal control. Error bars represent standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate (Student's t-test *p < 0.05, comparing between control and Cul4-overexpressing cells). B. Hsu cells were transfected with plasmid overexpressing Culex cullin (CxCul4). Empty vector (Control) was used as transfection control. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with CxVago-containing medium and total RNA was collected 48 h later. Real-time RT-qPCR was performed using Culex Vir1-specific primers. RpL32 primers were used as an internal control. Error bars represent standard error from three ( Fig 4C) . As a positive control, cells were stimulated with heat-inactivated E. coli for 1 h, which also showed increased luciferase activity.

To determine whether Cul4 acts via the proteasomal pathway, Hsu cells were transfected with the CxCul4 overexpression plasmid and, at 24 h post-transfection, infected with WNV and treated simultaneously with either MG132 (10 μM) or the ubiquitin activating enzyme E1 inhibitor PYR-41 (10 μM). Real-time RT-qPCR conducted on total RNA collected 48 hpi showed decreased CxVir1 expression in cells overexpressing CxCul4 compared with control (empty vector) cells in WNV infected cells. However, treatment of cells overexpressing CxCul4 with MG132 or PYR-41 resulted in significantly higher levels of CxVir1 expression compared with untreated cells. Real-time RT-qPCR for WNV NS1 showed there was a decrease in viral replication in cells transfected with CxCul4 and treated with MG132 or PYR-41 compared with the control (CxCul4 transfection alone) (Fig 4D) . To further determine significance of CxCul4 in STAT signaling, Hsu cells were transfected with dsRNA against CxCul4. As a control, cells were either not transfected (No dsRNA) or transfected with dsRNA against GFP (GFP dsRNA). Cells were infected with WNV 24 hours post-transfection and total RNA was collected 48 hpi. Real time RT-qPCR using CxVir1 primers showed increased expression after WNV infection which was further increased in cells transfected with CxCul4 dsRNA (Fig 4E) . CxVago on the other hand showed increased expression after WNV infection with no further increase in cells with CxCul4 dsRNA. To determine that action of CxCUl4 is via CxSTAT, cells were transfected with CxSTAT dsRNA along with dsRNA against CxCul4. Cells were infected with WNV 24 hours post-transfection. Total RNA was collected 48 hpi and real time RT-qPCR using WNV NS1 primers showed significant increase in cells with CxSTAT dsRNA and decrease in cells with CxCul4 dsRNA. Cells containing both CxCul4 and CxSTAT dsRNA showed no decrease in WNV NS1 levels indicating that CxCul4 action required CxSTAT (Fig 4F) . These results confirm that pro-viral effect of CxCul4 is via ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway.

To determine which WNV protein expression leads to overexpression of CxCul4, Hsu cells were transfected with select individual WNV genes cloned in insect vector (pIZ-V5/His). Total RNA was collected 48 hours post-transfection and real time RT-qPCR was performed using CxCul4 primers. As a control, real time RT-qPCR was performed using CxRpL32 primers. Western blot was performed on duplicate cells to confirm transfection and protein expression using anti-V5 antibody (S6 Fig). The results showed up-regulation of CxCul4 expression in cells transfected with WNV-NS1 (2 fold) and WNV-NS5 (3 fold) genes (Fig 5A) . This indicates NS1 and NS5 may be involved in upregulation of CxCul4 after WNV infection in Culex cells.

separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate (Student's t-test *p < 0.05, comparing between control and Cul4-overexpressing cells). C. Hsu cells were transfected with p6x2DRAF-Luc (STAT reporter) and pAct-Renilla (control) plasmids along with dsRNA against Culex Cul4 (Cul4 dsRNA) or GFP (GFP dsRNA). Cells were treated with heat-inactivated E. coli, WNV or PBS for 1 h. Luciferase activity was measured 16 h post-stimulation. Fold increase over untreated control were plotted after normalising with Renilla transfection control. Error bars represent standard error from six separate samples (Student's ttest *p < 0.05, comparing between GFP-dsRNA and Cul4-dsRNA cells for each stimulation). D. Hsu cells were transfected with plasmid overexpressing Culex cullin (CxCul4). Empty vector (Control) was used as a silencing control. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were infected with WNV and treated with MG132 (1 μM) or PYR-41 (1 μM) or treated with drugs alone. Total RNA was collected at 48 hpi and real time RT-qPCR was performed using Culex Vir1 and WNV NS1-specific primers. RpL32 primers were used as internal control. Error bars represent standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate (Student's t-test *p < 0.05, comparing between control and Cul4-overexpressing cells treated with or without inhibitors). E. Hsu cells were transfected with dsRNA against Culex cullin (Cul4 dsRNA). No dsRNA or GFP dsRNA was used as a silencing control. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were infected with WNV and total RNA was collected 48 hpi. Real-time RT-qPCR was performed using CxVir1 (Vir1) and CxVago (Vago)-specific primers. RpL32 primers were used as internal control. Error bars represent standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate (*p < 0.05, comparing between No dsRNA, GFP dsRNA and Cul4-knock-down cells). F. Hsu cells were transfected with dsRNA against Culex cullin (Cul4 dsRNA) or Culex STAT (STAT dsRNA) or both. GFP dsRNA was used as a silencing control (Control). At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were infected with WNV and total RNA was collected 48 hpi. Real-time RT-qPCR was performed using WNV NS1-specific primers. RpL32 primers were used as internal control. Error bars represent standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate (Student's t-test *p < 0.05, comparing between Control and Cul4 dsRNA or STAT dsRNA cells). As a control, expression of CxCullin3 (CPIJ011310) was measured after WNV infection or overexpression of WNV NS1 and NS5. Results showed no significant change in expression level (Fig 5B) , indicating effect of WNV is specific to CxCul4. Total RNA was collected at 24 hours post-transfection and real time RT-qPCR was performed using Culex Cul4-specific primers. RpL32 primers were used as internal control. Error bars represent standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate (Student's t-test *p < 0.05, significant from empty vector control). B. Real time Rt-qPCr was performed on cells treated as in A, using Culex Cullin3-specific primers. C. Hsu cells were transfected with dsRNA against Culex cullin (Cul4 dsRNA). GFP dsRNA was used as a silencing control (Control). At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were infected with WNV and cell lysates were collected 24 hours post-infection. Western blot was performed using anti-Culex STAT and anti-beta actin antibodies, with marker representing proteins with known molecular weight (in kDa). The experiment was repeated 3 times and representative blots shown here. D. Hsu cells were transfected with WNV genes (NS1, NS5 or NS3) along with dsRNA against Culex cullin (+). GFP dsRNA was used as a silencing control (-). Control indicates empty vector transfection. Cell lysates were collected 24 hours post-infection. Western blot was performed using anti-Culex STAT and antibeta actin antibodies. The experiment was repeated and representative blots shown here. E. Hsu cells were transfected with dsRNA against Culex cullin (Cul4 dsRNA). GFP dsRNA was used as a silencing control (GFP dsRNA). At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were infected with WNV and treated with MG132 (1 μM) and cell lysates were collected 24 hours post-infection. Immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-ubiquitin antibody, followed by Western blot using anti-ubiquitin (Upper) and anti-CxSTAT (lower) antibodies. WCL represents whole cells lysate (pre-IP), FT represents flow-through and IP represents immunoprecipitate (eluate). The experiment was repeated twice and representative blots shown here. F. Female Culex annulirostris mosquitoes were microinjected with dsRNA against Culex Cullin (Cul4). GFP dsRNA was used as a silencing control. At 24 h post-injection, mosquitoes were blood-fed with WNV for 1h. At 2 days and 10 days post-infection, mosquitoes were collected and processed for Western blot using anti-CxSTAT and anti-actin antibodies. The experiment was repeated and representative blots shown here.

Experiments were performed to determine whether WNV infection leads to STAT degradation via CxCul4. Hsu cells were transfected with dsRNA against CxCul4 and infected with WNV at 24 h post-transfection. Total cell lysates were collected at 24 hours post-infection and Western blot was performed using anti-CxSTAT antibody. As a control, cells were either transfected with GFP dsRNA (Control). The results (Fig 5C) showed cells infected with WNV showed decreased CxSTAT levels, which returned to baseline in cells transfected with dsRNA against CxCul4. Although, we cannot rule out the possibility that reduced degradation of CxSTAT upon CxCul4 knockdown is due to lower virus replication, these results combined with other data indicate that WNV infection leads to degradation of CxSTAT via CxCul4.

To further establish this, Hsu cells were transfected with WNV-NS1, WNV-NS5 or WNV-NS3 genes with or without transfection with dsRNA against CxCul4. As a control cells were transfected with dsRNA against GFP. Cell lysates were collected 48 hours post-transfection. Western blot was performed using anti-CxSTAT antibody. The results showed decreased STAT levels in cells transfected with WNV-NS1 or WNV-NS5 (Fig 5D) . The levels returned to baseline in cells also transfected with dsRNA against CxCul4. In WNV-NS3 transfected cells, there was no significant change in STAT level. These results indicate that WNV infection of Culex cells leads to degradation of CxSTAT via CxCul4, activated by WNV NS1 and NS5.

CxCul4, ortholog of mammalian Cullin4A/B, has previously been shown to be responsible for degradation of STAT via ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases are responsible for ubiquitylation of target proteins. To determine whether degradation of CxSTAT via CxCul4 occurs by ubiquitylation, Culex cells were transfected with dsRNA against CxCul4 (or GFP dsRNA as control). The cells were infected with WNV and cell lysates collected 48 hours post-infection. Immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-ubiquitin antibody, followed by Western blot using anti-ubiquitin and anti-CxSTAT antibodies. The results (Fig 5E) showed that STAT was co-immunoprecipitated with ubiquitin after WNV infection in control (GFP dsRNA) cells, indicating ubiquitylation of CxSTAT. CxSTAT was not co-immunoprecipitated with ubiquitin in cells transfected with dsRNA against CxCul4. The results suggest that CxCul4 plays a major role in ubiquitylation of CxSTAT after WNV infection.

To validate the significance of CxCul4 during viral infection of mosquitoes, female Culex annulirostris mosquitoes were microinjected with dsRNA against CxCul4. As a control, mosquitoes were microinjected with dsRNA against GFP. The mosquitoes were infected with WNV (NY99 strain) by blood-feeding 24 h post-microinjection. At 10 days post-infection, saliva from individual mosquitoes was collected in a capillary tube (see methods) and total RNA was collected from whole mosquito carcass and midgut. As a parallel experiment, mosquitoes were collected at day 2 and day 10 post-infection. Western blot was performed on whole mosquito using anti-CxSTAT and anti-actin antibodies. Results showed increased levels of CxSTAT by day 2 postinfection. The levels decreased to baseline by day 10 post-infection in control mosquitoes (GFP dsRNA); however in mosquitoes with CxCul4 dsRNA, STAT levels remained high (Fig 5E) . Real-time RT-qPCR results showed efficient knock-down (>60%) of CxCul4 mRNA in carcass after Cul4 dsRNA microinjections (Fig 6A) . The results also showed a decrease (>50%) in viral RNA (NS1) in whole mosquito carcass ( Fig 6B) and midgut (Fig 6D) in CxCul4 dsRNAinjected mosquitoes compared with the control, confirming pro-viral effect of CxCul4. Interestingly, real-time RT-qPCR results also showed a significant increase in CxVir1 mRNA expression in carcass (3-fold) ( Fig 6C) and midgut (5-fold) (Fig 6E) in CxCul4-knockdown mosquitoes, indicating increased Jak-STAT signaling. Plaque assays performed on mosquito saliva showed a significantly lower virus titer in mosquito saliva microinjected with CxCul4 dsRNA (88 pfu/mosquito) compared with control (GFP dsRNA) (429 pfu/mosquito) (Fig 6F) , indicating a lower likelihood of virus transmission by CxCul4 silenced mosquitoes. It should be noted that saliva from 3 mosquitoes with CxCul4 dsRNA injection showed higher viral titers (similar to controls). Further analysis showed that CxCul4 was not efficiently knocked down in these three mosquitoes (Fig 6A, inset) . These results further validate that CxCul4 has a proviral effect by inhibiting Jak-STAT pathway during WNV infection in mosquitoes. It should also be noted that~20-30% of mosquitoes from each group did not show any virus in the saliva, possibly indicative of vector competence of these mosquito species.

A number of studies have also been performed to identify differentially regulated genes during flavivirus infection in mammalian cells [31, [36] [37] [38] [39] . Transcriptome studies using genome-wide microarrays or next-generation deep sequencing of the transcriptome, as well as genome-wide siRNA studies, have revealed a number of pathways to be important during infection process [25, 31] . These include immune pathways, apoptotic pathways, cellular transport proteins, proteasomal pathways among others. Real-time RT-qPCR was performed using Culex Cul4 primers on mosquito midguts. E. Real-time RT-qPCR was performed using WNV NS1 primers on mosquito midguts. For all real-time RT-qPCR experiments, RpL32 primers were used as an internal control. For plotting, the mean for controls was arbitrarily set at 1 (median shown) and fold-change was calculated for each sample (Student's t-test *p < 0.005, comparing between control and Cul4-knock-down mosquitoes). F. Viral titer estimation conducted by plaque assay in mosquito saliva mixed with cell culture medium. Viral titers from individual saliva samples were plotted on the graph (Student's t-test *p < 0.005, comparing between control and Cul4-knock-down mosquitoes). Control (GFP dsRNA) N = 17; Cul4 dsRNA N = 17. Previous studies using microarray analyses to characterize the transcriptional response of mosquitoes to flavivirus infection have shown that a multitude of pathways appear to be involved, including the immune, cell-cycle/apoptosis, metabolic and proteasomal pathways as well as other cellular processes such as the transport machinery [10, 11] . Here we adopted an unbiased approach using high-throughput deep sequencing of the mosquito cell transcriptome during a synchronized (high multiplicity) infection with WNV. Our data also identified differentially regulated genes from a number of cellular pathways of which we selected ubiquitinproteasomal pathway for further functional analysis.

Proteasomal inhibition has been shown previously to affect replication of a wide range of viruses in mammalian cells, including herpesviruses [40] , poxviruses [41] , hepadnaviruses [42] , adenoviruses [43] , influenza viruses [44] , retroviruses [45] , coronaviruses [46] , paramyxoviruses [47] and rotaviruses [48] . Microarray studies have also shown that several ubiquitin-related genes are induced following infection in mosquito cells [32] . The ubiquitinproteasomal pathway is one of the major pathways involved in post-translational modifications, leading to degradation of proteins. It has also been implicated in various stages of viral infection in mammalian cells including virus entry, replication and exit [49] . The largest family of ubiquitin ligases (E3) is a group of proteins that contain a RING domain, a structural motif comprising eight cysteine and histidine residues that form the interface with E2 (ubiquitin conjugating) enzyme [18] . Substrate specificity is determined by variant RING ubiquitin ligases and also by multiprotein complexes that contain a conserved RING protein. Cullin RING ubiquitin ligases are one such family of proteins, containing eight mammalian members, each with different substrate specificity [22] . These proteins have been implicated in many cellular processes including cell-cycle regulation and cell signaling. Because of this, cullin RING ubiquitin ligases are frequently targeted by viruses to evade host immunity [33] . Viruses redirect these ligases to select specific host proteins for degradation in order to prevent the host response and promote viral replication and dissemination. For example, viruses have been shown to use cullins to prevent cellular apoptosis by degrading p53 [50] or inhibit the innate antiviral response by blocking interferon signaling [30] . In mammals, interferon is a key component of a major innate defensive response against invading viruses by activating Jak-STAT pathway and the expression of antiviral genes in neighbouring cells [51] . Some members of the Paramyxoviridae have been shown to hijack cullin4A ubiquitin ligase complexes to overcome the interferon response, by promoting degradation of STAT proteins. Specifically, the V protein of simian virus 5 causes degradation of STAT1 [29] , while the parainfluenza virus V protein causes degradation of STAT2 via the Cul4A substrate adaptor DDB1 [52] .

Recently, Culex Vago, which is induced in mosquitoes in response to WNV infection, was found to be functionally similar to mammalian interferon in that it is activated via the TRAF-NF-κB pathway and, upon secretion, activates the Jak-STAT pathway and an antiviral response in neighbouring cells [7, 35] . Our results here suggest that Culex STAT is regulated by Culex Cul4 (mammalian Cul4A/B ortholog), which has proviral activity during WNV infection, and that WNV may target STAT for degradation by inducing Culex Cul4 via NS1 and NS5 proteins. Suppression of the mammalian interferon-mediated Jak-STAT pathway has been shown to be a common property of vector-borne flaviviruses. Dengue NS5 protein has been shown to target STAT2 for degradation [53] and WNV NS5 suppressed phosphorylation of STAT1 [54] , leading to decreased signaling in mammalian system. Interestingly, our results suggest that the mosquito Jak-STAT pathway is also targeted by WNV via cullin RING ubiquitin ligase. Although, we have identified WNV NS1 and NS5 proteins to be responsible for upregulation of Cul4, the exact mechanism of this activation remains unknown. WNV NS1 and NS5 proteins have significantly different protein sequences, however both are involved in formation of viral replication complex. Studies are currently underway to determine whether this plays any part in the described mechanism. Our in vivo results also suggest that CxCul4 proviral activity may be mainly localized in the mosquito midgut and knockdown of CxCul4 increases Jak-STAT signaling in the midgut, thus decreasing the overall viral load in the body and, in turn, the saliva of these mosquitoes.

Our unbiased transcriptome analysis also indicated that other genes involved in the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway, including E1, UBC and other E3 ligases, as well as ubiquitin-specific proteases are differentially expressed during WNV infection, suggesting that this pathway has a critical role in the invertebrate response to infection and/or the viral host evasion strategy. Our results suggest that proteasomal pathway (and CxCullin4) does not play any role in WNV entry in mosquito cells (S5 Fig) . This is different than previously reported mechanism in mammalian cells [25] . This may be due to different mechanisms of viral entry in mammalian cells versus mosquito cells. It is also interesting that a number of reads from our data did not map to the published Culex quinquefasciatus transcriptome. Many of these transcripts may be expressed from unannotated genes which contribute to novel host-pathogen interactions in invertebrates.

Hsu (Culex quinquefasciatus) and RML12 (Aedes albopictus) cells were maintained at 28°C in Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Gibco #11415) containing 10% tryptose phosphate broth solution, 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution. West Nile virus (NY99-4132 strain) was used for the study. C6/36 (Aedes albopictus) cells were maintained in RPMI medium at 28°C and were used to propagate the virus. Vero cells maintained in EMEM at 37°C were used for plaque assays.

Total RNA was collected from Hsu cells (control and WNV infected) using Qiagen RNeasy kit following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was quantified and checked for quality using a bioanalyser. The experiment was conducted in duplicate with two RNA-Seq libraries generated for WNV-infected cells and two for uninfected control cells. Sequencing was conducted in a single lane of an Illumina HiSeq2000 (Micromon Facility, Monash University, Australia), generating more than 80 million reads per sample (S1 Table) .

Sequence reads (paired, 100 bp) were mapped using Tophat v2.0.8 (http://ccb.jhu.edu/ software/tophat/index.shtml) [55] to Culex quinquefasciatus (Johannesburg strain, CpipJ2.1) transcripts available from VectorBase (http://www.vectorbase.org) [56] . Differential isoform expression analysis was conducted using Cufflinks v1.3.0 (http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/ cufflinks/) [57] . Analysis of RNA sequencing quality was performed with FastQC version 0.10.1 (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) using the default options.

Pathway analysis of differentially regulated transcripts was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis v9.0 (Ingenuity Systems, www.ingenuity.com).

Total RNA was extracted from cells using the Qiagen RNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription was performed with random hexamer primers using the First Strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Real-time RT-qPCR was performed using gene-specific primers. As an internal control, real-time RT-qPCR was also performed using the housekeeping gene, RpL32. The control was set arbitrarily at 1 and fold-increase over control was calculated by the ΔΔCt method. The experiments were conducted at least three times, each in triplicates. The results were plotted in graph format as mean ± SD.

Proteasomal/ ubiquitylation inhibitors MG132 and PYR-41 (Sigma-Aldrich) were used at the described concentrations dissolved in DMSO. For controls, cells were treated with DMSO. For pre-treatment, cells were initially treated with MG132, followed by WNV infection for one hour. This was followed by replacing the medium with medium containing MG132 at appropriate concentrations.

Cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (25 mM Tri-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitor (Halt protease inhibitor cocktail, Pierce). The cell lysates were collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Protein samples (10 μg) were loaded onto polyacrylamide gradient gels (4-12%). After electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, proteins were blotted using anti-Culex STAT (rabbit polyclonal against peptide VVIVHGNQEPQSWATITWDNAFADINRV PFHVPDKVSWNLLAEALNTKYRASTGRSM TQENMHFLC), anti-WNV NS1, anti-WNV NS5 [58] or anti-V5 (Invitrogen) antibody followed by anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies. After adding substrate, the membrane was exposed to film to detect protein levels. Anti-β-actin antibody (Abcam) was used in immunoblots as a loading control.

Plaque assays were performed as previously described [7] . In brief, supernatant media from cells infected with WNV (10-fold dilutions) were added onto confluent Vero cell monolayers in 6-well plates. After 1 h incubation at 37°C, the cells were overlaid with medium containing agar. Plaques formed within 72 hpi were counted and the results were plotted graphically. The experiments were conducted at least twice, each with duplicates.

Gene-specific dsRNA (~400 nt) were prepared using the MEGAscript RNAi kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. dsRNAs were transfected into Hsu cells using Cellfectin according to a previously described protocol [7] . dsRNA against green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used as a knock-down specificity control.

STAT activation experiments were performed as previously described [59] . The STAT reporter plasmids were kindly provided by Prof. Martin Zeidler (University of Sheffield) [60] . In brief, Hsu cells were transfected with STAT reporter plasmid p6x2DRAF-Luc (multimerised Drosophila STAT-responsive element with a Firefly luciferase reporter) and a control plasmid, pAct-Renilla (Renilla luciferase gene under control of the Drosophila actin 5C promoter for constitutive expression). Cells were also transfected with dsRNA against Cul4 or GFP. Cells were stimulated with heat inactivated E. coli, WNV (MOI = 1) or PBS (Control) for 1h. Luciferase activity was measured at 16 h post-stimulation. Heat-inactivated bacteria were prepared by incubating 1μl of E. coli DH5α in 5 ml LB medium at 37°C for 16 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS. Heat inactivation was achieved by incubating the cells for 10 min at 90°C. 1 μl of the suspension was used per well.

Hsu cells under various conditions were treated with MG132 (1 μM) for 6 hours to prevent degradation of ubiquitylated proteins. Immunoprecipitation was performed using Pierce Crosslink IP kit (Thermo Scientific) following manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were lysed using lysis buffer and after preclearing were incubated with anti-ubiquitin antibody (Abcam) crosslinked to beads in column for 18 hours. Flow-through was collected and immunoprecipitate was eluted using elution buffer. The samples were separated on polyacrylamide gel and Western blot was performed using anti-ubiquitin and anti-CxSTAT antibodies.

Culex annulirostris mosquitoes were maintained in a diurnal cycle (12h/12h) with temperatures alternating for 23 and26°C and 65% humidity. Three to five day-old female mosquitoes (n = 40) were blood-fed on chicken skin membranes with WNV (1.13×10^6 pfu/ml) or 199 medium (as control) and the mosquitoes were incubated at 25°C and 65% humidity in an environmental cabinet (Thermoline Scientific, Smithfield, Australia) with a wet cotton pad (10% sucrose solution) provided daily as a food source. At 24 hpi, surviving females were collected for analysis. For this, mosquito midguts were dissected and homogenized using a bead-beater. RNA extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) by pooling four samples and was used for realtime RT-qPCR as described above.

Three to five day-old female mosquitoes (n = 40) were microinjected with dsRNA against CxCul4 or GFP (200 ng/mosquito). Mosquitoes were blood-fed with WNV (1.13×10^6 pfu/ ml) one day later and were maintained in a diurnal cycle (23/26°C) in an environmental cabinet. At 10-12 days post-infection, saliva was collected in capillary tubes containing 5 μl FCS for 10 min using a protocol described previously [61] . Midguts were dissected and homogenized using a bead-beater. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit from the midgut and carcass of individual mosquitoes and was used for real-time RTqPCR as described above. Saliva from each mosquito was diluted in 300 μl of L-15 medium and was used to determine viral titer by plaque assay as described above.

Standard error of the mean (SEM) was calculated and data analyzed using the non-paired Student's t-test for single mean comparisons.

First detection and genetic characterization of canine Kobuvirus in domestic dogs in Thailand

Background: Canine Kobuvirus (CaKoV) has been detected both in healthy and diarrheic dogs and in asymptomatic wild carnivores. In this study, we conducted a survey of CaKoV at small animal hospitals in Bangkok and vicinity of Thailand during September 2016 to September 2018. Results: Three hundred and seven rectal swab samples were collected from healthy dogs (n = 55) and dogs with gastroenteritis symptoms (n = 252). Of 307 swab samples tested by using one-step RT-PCR specific to 3D gene, we found CaKoV positivity at 17.59% (54/307). CaKoVs could be detected in both sick (19.44%) and healthy (9.09%) animals. In relation to age group, CaKoV could be frequently detected in younger dogs (25.45%). Our result showed no seasonal pattern of CaKoV infection in domestic dogs. In this study, we characterized CaKoVs by whole genome sequencing (n = 4) or 3D and VP1 gene sequencing (n = 8). Genetic and phylogenetic analyses showed that whole genomes of Thai CaKoVs were closely related to Chinese CaKoVs with highest 99.5% amino acid identity suggesting possible origin of CaKoVs in Thailand. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study was the first to report the detection and genetic characteristics of CaKoVs in domestic dogs in Thailand. CaKoVs could be detected in both sick and healthy dogs. The virus is frequently detected in younger dogs. Thai CaKoVs were genetically closely related and grouped with Chinese CaKoVs. Our result raises the concerns to vet practitioners that diarrhea in dogs due to canine Kobuvirus infection should not be ignored.

a survey of canine Kobuvirus in domestic dogs at small animal hospitals in 5 provinces of Thailand. The survey was conducted under the Chulalongkorn University's animal use and care protocol # 1731074. The result of this study provided the first detection and genetic characterization of CaKoV isolated from domestic dogs in Thailand.

During September 2016 to September 2018, we conducted a survey of viral enteric diseases in domestic dogs in small animal hospitals in 5 provinces of Thailand (Bangkok, Nakhon Ratchasima, Ratchaburi, Suphanburi, and Tak). We tested 307 rectal swab samples for CaKoV by using one-step RT-PCR specific to 3D gene. Based on a two-year survey, we found CaKoV positivity at 17.59% (54/307). CaKoVs could be detected in both sick (19.44% (49/252)) and healthy (9.09% (5/55)) animals. Our result showed no seasonal pattern of CaKoV infection in dogs (Figs. 1 and 2). In relation to age group, CaKoV could be frequently detected in younger dogs at 25.45% (42/165) (Additional file 2: Table S2 ). The coinfections of CaKoV with other enteric viral pathogens were observed including CaKoV/Canine parvovirus/Canine Coronavirus (n = 6), CaKoV/Canine parvovirus (n = 20) and CaKoV/Canine Coronavirus (n = 2). In this study, 12 CaKoVs were selected and characterized by whole genome sequencing (n = 4) or 3D and VP1 gene sequencing (n = 8). The viruses were selected to represent epidemiological and demographic data such as age, date of isolation and breed. In this study, nucleotide sequences of the CaKoV were submitted to the GenBank database under the accession numbers MK201776 -MK201795 (Table 1) .

Phylogenetic analysis of whole genome of CaKoVs showed that the Thai CaKoVs were closely related to each other and clustered with Aichivirus A. The cluster Aichivirus A contains Kobuviruses from dogs, cats, rodents, bats and human. While Aichivirus B and C contain Kobuviruses from cattle and pigs, respectively. Based on whole genome sequence, Thai CaKoVs were closely related to Chinese CaKoVs sub-cluster but in separated sub-cluster from the viruses from the US, UK, Brazil and Tanzania (Fig. 3) . Phylogenetic analysis of 3D and VP1 of Thai CaKoVs and reference CaKoVs from various animal species were also performed. Similarly, 3D gene of Thai CaKoVs were grouped together with Chinese CaKoVs (G1 sub-cluster) but separated from the viruses in sub-clusters G2 as well as G3 (Fig. 4 ). Phylogenetic analysis of VP1 gene, the viruses can be clustered into 2 major subgroups, US/EU/Africa subgroup and China/Thailand subgroup (Fig. 5 ).

We compared the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of Thai CaKoVs against those of reference viruses from the US, UK, Italy, China, and Korea (Tables 2 and 3 most variable region of VP1 is position 201-243, especially proline rich region. Putative proline rich region at VP1-228-240 (P 228 XPPPPXPPXPXP 240 ) was also observed in Thai CaKoVs as well as reference viruses (Table 4 ). In this study, unique amino acids were found in Thai and Chinese CaKoVs at the position, 65 V, 67D, 119L, 138T, 150P, 151M, 153D, 201S, 204Q, 205Q, 201Q, 213T and 241E ( Table 4 ). Analysis of predicted amino acid cleavage sits of whole genome were conserved among Thai CaKoVs (Table 5 ).

Canine Kobuvirus (CaKoV) is an emerging pathogen in Thailand. To the best of our knowledge, the CaKoV was described in Asia in retrospective study in Korea in 2011 and have been reported in Japan, China and Australia, respectively [2, 15, 17, 21] . However, the CaKoV have never been reported in the country or South East Asia region. In this study, during the 2 year-survey program, we found CaKoV positivity at 17.59% in both sick (19.44%) and healthy (9.09%) animals. Compare to other studies, CaKoV % positivity in this study was lower than those in China (54%) and Korea (32.2%) [14, 22] . Our result showed that the CaKoV could be frequently detected in younger dogs at 27% which consistence with previous reports [15] . Similar to other previous studies, co-infections with other enteric viral pathogens were observed such as CaKoV/Canine parvovirus and CaKoV/ Canine Coronavirus [12, 14, 15] . Moreover, CaKoVs were detected in both diarrheic and non-diarrheic dogs which consistent with other studies [2, 15] . Our result supported that this virus may not be the only cause of enteric disease in dogs. Nevertheless, the CaKoV infection have still been identified in symptomatic dogs without other enteric pathogen infections [12] . Our observation supported that the role of CaKoV as a primary pathogen of acute gastroenteritis remain unclear.

In this study, the genome size of 4 Thai CaKoVs is 7, 530 bp with one ORF encoding 2,444 amino acids of a putative polyprotein, which comparable to previous reports. Genome organization of CaKoV includes leader protein (L), structural proteins (VP0, VP3, VP1), nonstructural proteins (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D). Phylogenetic analyses showed that the Thai CaKoVs were closely related to each other and clustered with Aichivirus A. It is noted that Thai CaKoVs were closely related to Chinese CaKoVs sub-cluster but in separated sub-cluster from the viruses from the US, UK, Brazil and Tanzania (Fig. 3) . Phylogenetic analyses of 3D gene showed similar result which Thai CaKoVs were grouped together with Chinese CaKoVs (G1 sub-cluster). This observation regarding to the sub-clusters of CaKoVs was in agreement with the previous study [23] . On the other hand, based on VP1 gene, the viruses can be clustered into 2 major subgroups, US/EU/Africa subgroup and China/Thailand subgroup which similar to the previous reports [16, 22] (Figs. 4 and 5) .

Genetic analyses of Thai CaKoVs showed that whole genome of 4 Thai CaKoVs posed highest nucleotide similarity to Chinese CaKoVs including SMCD-59 and CH-1. This observation supported phylogenetic analysis that Thai CaKoVs were closely related to Chinese CaKoVs sub-cluster but in separated sub-cluster from (100) 100 (100) 100 (100) 100 (100) 100 (100) 100 (100) 100 (100) 100 (100) 100 (100) 100 (100) (100) 100 (100) 97.1 (100) 99.4 (100) 100 (100) 100 (100) 100 (100) (100) 96 (100) the viruses from the US, UK, Brazil and Tanzania. Of all viral genes, the VP1 gene was the most diverse gene among Thai CaKoVs and other reference CaKoVs. Similar observation was also reported in previous study that VP1 protein is the most variable capsid protein [24] . It is noted that the putative proline rich region at VP1-228-240 (P 228 XPPPPXPPXPXP 240 ) was observed both in Thai CaKoVs and reference viruses. Previous studies indicated that proline rich region may associate with enteric receptor binding of the viruses [14, 24] . It is noted that Thai CaKoVs posed unique PPP (VP1; 228-240), which also observed most reference viruses from China, Korea, Japan, US, UK suggesting unique characteristic. These unique amino acids were not observed in the CaKoV from the Australia (CE9), Brazil (BRA/26) and Tanzania (TZ/75, TZ82) [16, 20] . However, the association of these unique amino acids and viral pathogenesis is still need to be further investigated. Based on genetic analysis, unique amino acids at the position, 65 V, 67D, 119L, 138 T, 150P, 151M, 153D, 201S, 204Q, 205Q, 201Q, 213 T and 241E were observed. These unique amino acids of China/ Thailand sub-cluster could be benefit for the detection of virus origin or diagnostic purpose in the future. Similar to previous study, analysis of predicted amino acid cleavage sits of whole genome were conserved among CaKoVs except one variation at 776/777 (VP3/VP1) which unique in wild carnivores [16] .

In conclusion, this study is the first to report of canine Kobuvirus in dogs in Thailand. CaKoVs were mostly detected in clinical dogs of young age. However, the viruses 

Sample collection was conducted in domestic dogs at small animal hospitals in Bangkok and vicinity of Thailand During September 2016 to September 2018. 307 rectal swab samples were collected from healthy dogs (n = 55) and dogs with gastroenteritis symptoms (n = 252) including vomiting, watery diarrhea, hemorrhagic diarrhea and dehydration. The swab samples were collected from dogs of young age (< 1 year) (n = 165), adult (1-5 years) (n = 98) and older (> 5 years) (n = 44). The animal demographic data including age, sex, breed, and vaccination history were also recorded. The ethics was conducted under the Chulalongkorn University's animal use and care protocol # 1731074. The consent to participate of the owners of the animals used in this study was obtained in writing.

All 307 samples were subjected to canine Kobuvirus identification by one step RT-PCR using primers specific to 3D gene of CaKoV [21] . First, RNA extraction was performed using the QIAsymphony DSP Viral/Pathogen mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following manufacturer's instructions. To detect CaKoV, RNA samples were screened for 3D gene of CaKoV by using one step RT-PCR assay.

The primers used in this study were previously described including U1F (5′-CATGCTCCTCGGTGGTCTCA-3′) and U1R (5′-GTCCGGGTCCATCACAGGGT -3′) [ 

The phylogenetic and genetic analyses were performed by comparing nucleotide sequences of Thai CaKoVs with those of Kobuvirus available from the GenBank database. The reference nucleotide sequences of CaKoVs were retrived based on their different geographic locations, host species and date of isolation. Phylogenetic analysis of CaKoV was performed by using MEGA v.6.0 (Tempe, AZ, USA) [29] with neighbor-joining method with Kimura 2-parameter with 1,000 bootstrap replicates and Beast program with Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) with 10,000,000 generations and an average standard deviation of split frequencies < 0.05 [30] . For genetic analysis, the nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acids of CaKoV were aligned and compared using MegAlign software v.5.03 (DNASTAR Inc.; Wisconsin, USA). Pairwise comparison of nucleotides and amino acids of Thai CaKoV and those of reference CaKoVs were conducted. The variable and unique amino acids related to receptor binding of the viruses and host preferences of CaKoVs were monitored.

Epidemic predictions in an imperfect world: modelling disease spread with partial data

Subject Areas: health and disease and epidemiology, computational biology

Modelling of infectious diseases is a rapidly growing field in which mathematical modellers can play a significant role in determining how applied knowledge can be translated into an understanding of dynamics at the population level [1] [2] [3] [4] . During the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in the UK in 2001, several research groups developed a range of models that were able to predict the spatio-temporal pattern of disease spread and the impact of control strategies [1, 3, 5] . The use of these models in 2001 highlighted the role that models could play in shaping policy. Since then, the infection data from the 2001 epidemic have enabled research to be carried out to predict optimal culling and vaccination strategies both for the 2001 epidemic itself and for any future FMD epidemic in the UK and elsewhere [6] [7] [8] [9] .

In the 2001 FMD outbreak, early dissemination of the disease, prior to the first detected case, was mainly a result of long-distance movement of livestock between farms and through markets [10] . In other countries where FMD is endemic, livestock movements are believed to play a significant role in disease persistence [11] . Movements of live animals are also thought to cause significant transmission of diseases such as bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in the UK [12, 13] , as well as vector-borne diseases such as trypanosomiasis in southeast Asia, Australasia and Africa [14, 15] , and Rift Valley fever in Africa [16] . In cases such as these, infected livestock may be moved prior to showing symptoms, and therefore there is a risk of long-distance spread occurring. It is therefore crucial to understand the risk of infection spread associated with livestock movements.

In the UK, an annual livestock census records the location and species composition of all livestock farms. Births, deaths and movements of animals are recorded for individual cattle via the Cattle Tracing System (CTS), and for batches of other livestock via the Animal Movement Licence scheme. Such data have driven the development of sophisticated models to capture and predict the spread of livestock diseases such as FMD [1, 8, 17, 18] , bovine tuberculosis [12, 19] and Escherichia coli [20] . However, many countries around the world do not routinely collect farm-level data, or they are not readily available for research owing to issues regarding privacy. For example, in the USA, the National Agricultural Statistics Service carries out an agricultural census every 5 years. In order to preserve anonymity for farmers, all data are aggregated at the county level, and therefore precise locations of livestock farms are unknown. Furthermore, movement data are held at the individual state level, and there is no requirement for livestock movements to be recorded unless movements are out of state [21] . In the UK, the poultry industry infers movements between holdings using targeted sampling of premises based upon their function and size. This method predominantly targets large farms, and therefore does not accurately capture the demographic characteristics of the underlying farm population [22] . Therefore, it is important to understand the ability of models to predict the potential for disease spread through livestock movements when only a partial sample of the network is available.

Partial network data constitute a well-known problem, and have been studied extensively in social sciences and other fields, such as epidemiology in humans and livestock diseases. While the amount of data available to modellers is increasing, so too are privacy concerns. In order to predict the risk of disease spread in humans across large spatial scales, detailed movement networks must be established. These networks can be informed using commuting and migration data available from population censuses [23] [24] [25] . These data capture long-term trends, but may not be appropriate at predicting movements over a shorter time scale, and therefore can be complemented by the inclusion of other information such as mobile phone data. Mobile phone records track locations and times that individuals make and receive calls, and therefore can act as a proxy for shorter-scale movement patterns [23, 26] . While full access to these datasets is not readily available, previous work indicates that partial samples may be sufficient to accurately predict the risk associated with disease spread across these networks [24, 27] .

In situations where only partial network information is available, it may be necessary to reconstruct the network. Different approaches can be applied to construct contact networks. The most basic methods involve random sampling of nodes (i.e. individuals or farms [28] ) or random sampling of edges (i.e. links between nodes). However, it may be possible to capture the key properties of a network more efficiently using an approach such as snowball sampling (SBS). SBS is typically used in situations where the target population is small and hard to find. A number of individuals from the target population are asked to nominate an x number of people from the target population [29] . This method has been used previously to identify networks of sexual contacts for HIV-positive individuals [30] . In the case of livestock, when there may be knowledge regarding the size of farms or number of aggregated movements from a farm ( per year), a targeted sampling approach could be used where larger farms or farms with the highest number of movements are sampled. When constructing networks, including specific network characteristics (such as age structure) improves the quality of the constructed network [31] . Previous studies have shown that subsets of networks are not always representative of the whole network (e.g. scale-free networks [28] ). Therefore, caution is needed when networks are constructed with partial data.

In previous work, Tildesley et al. [32] demonstrated that even in the absence of precise locations of farms, accurate predictions of the impact of interventions are possible. We aim to develop an understanding of the predictive power of mathematical models when only a subset of the network information is available. We develop a model to simulate the spread of a rapidly spreading disease such as FMD through the UK cattle movement network. Mathematical models have previously played a key role in determining the risk of disease spread through networks of livestock movements for diseases such as FMD [17, 18, 21, 33] , bTB [12, 13, 19] and bluetongue virus [34, 35] . Our aim in this paper is to investigate the ability of such models to provide policy advice in countries where only partial information regarding livestock movements is available.

We compare four imperfect data types: random sampling of movements (weighted edges), random sampling of farms (nodes), SBS [30, 36] of farms and targeted sampling of farms. If appropriate, we then scale the sampled networks up, so that the original number of movements is used for the epidemic simulations. In the UK, selling and buying of livestock often takes place through livestock markets. Previous work suggests that these markets played a substantial role during the 2001 FMD outbreak [10] . As animals from different farms are kept in close proximity, there is a risk of disease transmission between batches of animals resulting in spread of infection to multiple farms. Moreover, it is known that movements from markets cover a large geographical area [37] . Therefore, we investigate the potential role of markets in disease transmission between farms.

This study will be highly informative for countries where livestock movement data are not routinely available. The outputs of this work will provide guidance to livestock industries around the world regarding both the quantity of data required to predict spread of disease and how to target data collection should it not be possible to record all livestock movements.

In this paper, we use data from the 2010 CTS database for Great Britain, provided by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) via the Animal and Plant Health Agency. If multiple animals were moved on the same day from one farm to another, this was treated as one movement; markets were initially not explicitly included. Slaughterhouses were considered as sinks, and therefore movements to slaughterhouses were ignored even when going through a livestock market. In total, there were 70 243 farms and 327 markets in our dataset, with 856 454 movements in total. A total of 635 016 movements passed through markets, with 47 692 farms using cattle markets at least once during 2010.

Four methods of sampling from this database are implemented and compared here. A directed weighted-static adjacency matrix A [38] was constructed for each set of sampled data, in which nodes represent farms and edges represent (directed) cattle movements. An edge a ij is defined to be non-zero if cattle are moved from farm i to farm j during the year. The weight of the edge represents the frequency of movements from farm i to farm j in 2010 (i.e. the total number of days on which movements occurred divided by 365).

For random movement sampling (RMS), we list the recorded movements and randomly sample from this list. The depleted rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc. R. Soc. B 282: 20150205 network is then built from the remaining movements and the resultant network is rescaled such that the total weight of the rebuilt network is equal to that of the original network,

: This method explicitly depends on knowledge of the total weight of the network.

In the node sampling schemes, a 'sampled' node has all its edges sampled. A node is said to be 'captured' if it is connected to a sampled node but it has not been sampled itself. For all of these schemes, we assume that the total number of nodes N in the network is known. We sample a set S of N S nodes and capture N C nodes, the N S sampled nodes plus their connected non-sampled neighbours. This method will therefore preserve the degree of the initially sampled nodes N S , but for the remaining nodes that are captured, only the edges that link them to the N S nodes will be recorded.

We consider three methods of node sampling in this paper. In the first method, we use random node sampling (RNS) such that all movements from a certain percentage of nodes are selected. A more advanced form of node sampling is SBS [36] . In this method, an initial set of nodes are sampled at random. At the next stage, the nodes captured by the initial sampled nodes are in turn sampled. This process can continue until all nodes have been sampled. In this paper, we consider second-order SBS, such that an initial set of nodes are sampled and the nodes that this set of nodes are connected to are also sampled.

The final node sampling scheme considered is targeted node sampling (TNS). In TNS, we sample specific nodes based on certain criteria. In this case, we chose the weighted-degree of the node. All nodes having a weighted-degree of at least x are sampled and their neighbours are captured (electronic supplementary material, figure S1). A graphical depiction of the three node sampling network schemes is shown in the electronic supplementary material, figure S2 .

We first considered rescaling the network formed by the node sampling methods in a similar way to that for the RMS method. We used the average weighted-degree of the sampled nodes kw sampled l ¼ 1=N S P i[S P j (a ij þ a ji ) to estimate the total weight of the original networkW original ¼ kw sampled lN=2, and rescale the network as in equation (2.1) but using the estimate for the total weight of the original network. However, as shown in electronic supplementary material, figure S6 , these scaled networks result in significant overpredictions of epidemic size, particularly when small percentages of the nodes are sampled. For the remainder of this paper, we therefore use the unscaled versions of the node sampling methods.

The properties of the underlying network may have a significant effect on epidemic dynamics [39] . We therefore consider how network properties change as fewer data are used by the various sampling schemes. We first consider the number of strongly connected components of the network. A subset of nodes forms a strongly connected component if each of the nodes can connect to each other node by following a path which preserves edge direction. If the largest of these components is of the same order as the complete network it is known as the giant strongly connected component (GSCC) and gives a lower bound to the maximum size of an outbreak on the network if the disease is perfectly transmissible [33] . In addition, we explore the impact of the sampling schemes upon the mean and standard deviation of the weighted w and unweighted k degree of nodes in the GSCC. Finally, we investigate the tendency for similar nodes to connect to each other through degree assortativity [40, 41] . These statistics are averaged over 1000 realizations of the network for each sampling method. The diameter of the GSCC was also measured but, owing to extensive computational time, this was only calculated for a single realization of the network. The diameter of a network is the length of the longest shortest path across the network [40] . As well as the network statistics mentioned previously, we also explore the number of nodes and edges captured by the various sampling schemes as the percentage of sampled data varies.

A stochastic susceptible -infectious -recovered (SIR) model was used to investigate epidemic behaviour on the livestock network. The probability of farm i becoming infected is defined as

where I i ¼ 1 if farm i is infected and zero otherwise, and b is the transmission rate. Infected farms recover after a period T and cannot be reinfected. We aim to investigate spread of relatively 'fast-moving' diseases in the absence of movement restrictions such as FMD. We make the assumption that transmission of infection to a farm results in all animals on that farm moving into the infectious class. Given this assumption, the risk of infection between any pair of nodes in the movement network is based upon the number of movements between them rather than the number of animals moved. In order to investigate the impact of epidemiological parameters upon model predictions, we explore a range of values for the transmission parameter and the infectious period, such that b ¼ 1, 2, 5, 10 and T ¼ 7, 14, 21, 28 days.

After reconstructing the movement network, epidemics were seeded randomly in Cumbria, Aberdeenshire or Devon. These three counties have a high number of cattle farms and livestock movements, and therefore epidemics starting in these counties are more likely to produce a high number of cases than in other parts of the UK. Cumbria and Devon were also two major hotspots of infection during the UK FMD outbreak in 2001 [3] . A random source farm in each county was infected initially for each simulation, and we investigated the predicted final epidemic size, duration, peak size and the model prediction of the geographical spread of disease.

A thousand networks were created for each sampling scheme. Of these, 100 were randomly selected for simulations. Statistics are averaged over 1000 simulations that had a final epidemic size of at least 10 farms. Pseudo-code for the SIR process is included in electronic supplementary material, algorithm 1.

Markets may play a key role in amplification of disease transmission [37] . The CTS explicitly states whether a movement went through a market and, if so, which market was used. This allows us to construct networks that include markets as nodes. The above-listed sampling schemes can all be applied to this situation. There is significant uncertainty regarding the level of contact of animals from different batches (farms) on a market, and therefore the risk of transmission between animals during their stay on the market. For this reason, we investigate the effect of two extreme assumptions of transmission within a market (electronic supplementary material, figure S3 ). In the first scenario, we assume no within-market transmission, such that infection is only transmitted between the source and the destination farm. We assume complete segregation between herds being strictly enforced (this would be equivalent to having no markets in the network). In the second scenario, we assume no segregation and no biosecurity at rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc. R. Soc. B 282: 20150205 a market, such that all batches that move through a market mix with one another homogeneously. In this case, we use the CTS data to determine which batches of cattle move through a market. When an infected batch moves to a market, that market becomes infected and we then assume that infection can be transmitted to all possible destination farms (as determined based on the destinations of all batches that move from the market) with an equal probability. A graphic depicting how the network is altered by the inclusion of markets is shown in the electronic supplementary material, figure S3 , and pseudo-code for the updated epidemic process is shown in the electronic supplementary material, algorithm 2.

In the UK, livestock has to be removed 4 h after the last market sale and consequently does not stay overnight at a livestock market [42] . Therefore, we assumed that cattle are moved on and off a market on the same day, and that an infectious market becomes susceptible again the following day. If this assumption were to be relaxed, the model could be altered by giving markets a longer infectious period.

Simulations are carried out in the same way as detailed in §2d with the one exception that we only run outbreaks for the length of one infectious period. The increased transmissibility from the inclusion of markets results in substantially larger epidemics, and therefore one infectious cycle is sufficient to analyse the effects of the different sampling methods.

As the percentage of nodes sampled decreases, the number of movements and nodes captured is observed to decrease for all sampling methods (figure 1). As the network fragments, the size of the GSCC decreases while the number of strongly connected components increases. Both the TNS and SBS sampling schemes outperform the RNS scheme in preserving robustness across all measured statistics as the percentage of nodes sampled decreases (figure 1). Within the giant component, the mean degree and degree standard deviation remain robust with approximately 15-20% of the data for both TNS and SBS.

The complete network has assortativity coefficients close to zero, meaning there is not a tendency for similar nodes to connect to or avoid each other. This holds true within the GSCC for all node sampling schemes (electronic supplementary material, figure S4 ). Similar behaviour is observed for the mean local clustering coefficient, which is small and does not change appreciably. The network diameter is 24-TNS and SBS preserve this relatively small diameter well within the GSCC, but for small sample sizes the diameter increases under the RNS scheme. Plots for assortativity, clustering and diameter are shown in electronic supplementary material, figure S4. 

In order to explore the epidemiological effects of the various sampling methods, we compare each method with simulations run on the full network. The robustness of a sampling method is determined by whether the mean simulation for a method using a certain percentage of data lies within the 95% CIs of the mean of simulations run in the full network. We focus on key epidemiological quantities such as final size, peak size and epidemic duration. While it is informative to explore the effect of partial knowledge upon epidemic duration, for rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc. R. Soc. B 282: 20150205 many diseases livestock movement bans will be implemented as soon as cases are reported. We therefore also look at predictions of the epidemic size after 6 and 12 weeks using the different sampling methods. We denote the threshold at which a scheme fails to be robust as S min , the minimum sampling threshold. Initially, we set b ¼ 1 and T ¼ 21 days. Sensitivity to these parameter values is explored below (electronic supplementary material, figures S13-S16).

For outbreaks seeded in Cumbria and simulated on the full dataset, we obtain a final mean epidemic size of 185 farms, with a mean duration of 22 weeks and a mean peak size of 45 farms (figure 2; electronic supplementary material, figure S8 ). The mean epidemic sizes after 6 and 12 weeks were 23 and 64 farms, respectively. For all node sampling methods without rescaling, the epidemic size is under-predicted as the percentage of nodes sampled decreases (figure 2). After six weeks, S min ¼ 3% for the TNS method, 20% for the SBS method and 80% for the RNS method. After 12 weeks, the percentage of nodes that must be sampled increases to 9%, 30% and 90% for the TNS, SBS and RNS methods, respectively (figure 2b). In order for these methods to accurately predict the full epidemic, 14%, 40% and 90% of the nodes must be sampled for the TNS, SBS and RNS methods, respectively (figure 2c). For the RMS method, S min ¼ 30% for 6 weeks, 50% for 12 weeks and 80% for the whole epidemic. Contour plots for epidemic size predictions for outbreaks seeded in Cumbria for each week of the outbreak (from week 1 to the end of the epidemic) are shown in electronic supplementary material, figures S8-S11. All methods provide accurate predictions of the size of the epidemic in the first few weeks. However, for longer durations, the TNS and the SBS methods provide the most robust predictions of epidemic size over time. Similar behaviour is observed for model predictions of epidemic duration and epidemic peak size (electronic supplementary material, figures S8-S11b,c)-the TNS method is able to accurately capture these characteristics when only 15% of the nodes are sampled, compared with 30%, 80% and 90% for the SBS, RMS and RNS methods, respectively.

The TNS method is consistently found to provide most accurate predictions of epidemic size, regardless of the county of disease introduction and disease parameters. In Devon, only 3% of the nodes require sampling for the TNS method to predict epidemic sizes at 6 weeks, compared with 10%, 20% and 80% for the SBS, RMS and RNS methods, respectively, with similar effects seen at 12 weeks and for the full epidemic (electronic supplementary material, figure S17). Similar behaviour is observed in Aberdeenshire (electronic supplementary material, figure S19) . The values for S min for the full epidemic for all sampling methods for epidemics seeded in the three counties are summarized in electronic supplementary material, table S1.

As the transmission rate of the disease increases, epidemic sizes increase and a higher percentage of nodes are required for all sampling methods to make accurate predictions. For example when b ¼ 2, 25% of the nodes must be sampled using the TNS method and 50% for the SBS method to predict the overall epidemic size for outbreaks seeded in Cumbria, whereas for the RNS method almost all nodes must be sampled to capture epidemic behaviour (electronic supplementary material, figure S13). As the infectious period of the disease increases, a higher percentage of nodes needs to be sampled, but the effect of this is less pronounced than a variation in the transmission rate (electronic supplementary material, figures S14 and S15). For diseases with a very high transmission rate, a much higher percentage of nodes must be sampled for all methods, even when the infectious period is short (electronic supplementary material, figure S16). When we include within-market transmission into our model, we observe significantly larger epidemic sizes, with the mean epidemic size after one infectious period when b ¼ 1 and T ¼ 21 being 2266 farms for outbreaks seeded in Cumbria. The TNS and SBS methods under-predict epidemic sizes when less than 35% and 50% respectively of the nodes are sampled (electronic supplementary material, figure S7 ). In contrast to the scenario where markets do not amplify transmission, the RMS method predicts epidemic sizes accurately even when only a very small number (approx. 20%) of movements are sampled. This suggests that, if a significant level of transmission is thought to occur within markets, then either TNS or RMS would be the preferred strategies if only limited resources were available. Similar results are observed for outbreaks seeded in Devon and Aberdeenshire.

It is important to consider not only the size of the simulated epidemics, but also how well the model captures the spatial spread of infection when partially sampled networks are used. When epidemics are seeded in Cumbria, almost all infected movements occur within Cumbria itself and to neighbouring counties ( figure 3 ). An average of 8.9 farms become infected in Cumbria after 12 weeks, with 13.9 in North Yorkshire and 4.2, 4.0, 4.0 and 8.0 in Durham, Lancashire, Dumfries and Galloway, and Aberdeen, respectively. All other counties have epidemic sizes of fewer than two farms when the epidemic is seeded in Cumbria.

Using S min for each of the sampling methods, we find that SBS captures the main epidemic hotspots well, but slightly overestimates epidemic sizes in these hotspots. RMS also performs well, but slightly underestimates epidemic sizes. The TNS method proves an accurate predictor of epidemic sizes in all the most infected counties, with 8.7 and 13.7 farms being infected on average after 12 weeks in Cumbria and North Yorkshire respectively ( figure 3) .

When markets are included the pattern of spatial spread is found to be similar to that without markets (electronic supplementary material, figure S12). The three most highly infected counties on the full network are Cumbria, North Yorkshire and Aberdeenshire, with mean epidemic sizes of 210, 258 and 238, respectively. When markets are included, we observe much larger epidemics in Devon, Somerset and northeast Wales. We also observe that each of the three sampling methods compares well with the original network at the S min threshold. Similar results are observed when outbreaks are seeded in Aberdeenshire and Devon-transmission within markets results in outbreaks with a much larger spatial extent than outbreaks in which markets do not play a role in transmission (electronic supplementary material, figures S21-S24).

In order for models to be used to predict the potential for disease spread in livestock, there is reliance upon accurate data regarding farm locations and movements of livestock between farms. Significant work has been done in the UK to predict the potential for disease spread through the livestock network [12, 17, 18] owing to the existence of the CTS and the animal movement licence scheme. In many other countries around the world, the lack of such databases means that it is impossible to develop a model that uses precise movement data, and an alternative approach must be used. In such countries, it may be impossible to ever record all movement data either owing to the sheer size of the industry (in countries such as the USA) or owing to the cost associated with implementing an animal licence scheme. However, a more limited data collection scheme may be possible, whereby movements are recorded for a subset of the livestock movement network.

A simple way to collect a subset of livestock movement data would be to randomly sample all movements from a given set of random farms (i.e. using the RNS method). This method proved ineffective at reproducing the mean epidemics seen on the complete network. An alternative strategy to collect movement data would be to randomly sample movements from any farm (i.e. the RMS method). In a practical sense, this would be a much more difficult strategy to implement, requiring individual farmers to keep a record of livestock moving from their farm a given percentage of the time. This method is found to be more effective than the RNS method, particularly in the case when within-market transmission occurs. In that case, only 10-20% of movements are required in order to accurately predict epidemic sizes. For lower percentages, the model predicts smaller epidemics than observed using the true network data, and in that case suggested intervention strategies may not be sufficient to control outbreaks. It may, however, be possible to make accurate predictions with a lower percentage of movement data when incorporating a Bayesian kernel approach to scale up a partially observed network [43] . An alternative approach may be to adopt targeted movement sampling where movements would be recorded based on some criterion. For example, particularly frequent movements between pairs of nodes could be recorded, or shipments involving a large number of animals. Both these options were investigated, but neither proved to be particularly successful at reconstructing an accurate realization of the original network.

If only limited resources are available for data collection, it may be more efficient to record movements only from the most highly connected farms (the TNS method) or to use SBS (the SBS method). The TNS method proves significantly more effective than both the RMS and RNS methods when markets do not contribute to transmission-less than 20% of all farms would need to be surveyed in order to predict epidemic sizes to within 90% confidence in the UK for outbreaks seeded in Cumbria, Devon and Aberdeenshire. The model also gives a very good approximation of the spatial spread of the disease, the size of the epidemic peak and the epidemic duration. When markets contribute towards disease amplification, the TNS method requires that around 30% of all nodes would need to be surveyed in order to accurately predict epidemic sizes. The SBS method is found to perform less effectively than the TNS method, as this strategy rapidly identifies the most highly connected nodes that are likely to contribute most significantly to disease transmission. However, the SBS method may be more practical to implement as it does not require prior knowledge of the relative connectivity of the farms in the network.

The TNS and SBS methods have worked favourably in the livestock network described here. While one must take care when making inference from a subnetwork to the full network [28] , it would be of great interest to the broader study of disease spread on partially observed networks to test these strategies further on livestock networks such as those available in other European countries [44] [45] [46] . The results of this work provide evidence of the viability of using partially sampled data to predict disease spread in livestock [21] and humans [23] [24] [25] [26] , and will inform data collection strategies in situations where complete knowledge of the network is impossible (e.g. wildlife movements [47, 48] ).

The role played by markets in disease transmission may have a significant effect upon the predictability of the sampling methods. When markets do not contribute to disease transmission, only a very small percentage of nodes needs to be sampled using the TNS method. However, when we make the assumption that all batches on a market are well mixed, a much larger proportion of the nodes must be sampled. We also find that in this case, the RMS method requires sampling of a much smaller percentage of movements than the nonmarket scenario. This is unsurprising-markets represent very highly connected nodes in the network, and therefore when they are explicitly included in the model, an RMS approach will preferentially sample movements to and from these highly connected nodes. The model currently assumes that livestock do not stay overnight on markets, in line with Defra policy, and hence any infectious markets would become susceptible the following day. Should this not be the case, the role of markets in disease transmission may be slightly altered. Therefore, our results suggest that a more thorough, disease-specific analysis of the precise role of markets in disease transmission would be required in the future in order to determine context-specific optimal sampling strategies. However, our sensitivity analysis shows that TNS is the preferred sampling strategy for all studied transmission rates and infectious periods.

The model presented in this paper uses a weighted static network to simulate the risk of transmission between livestock farms. Weighted static networks are regularly used in livestock disease models, and previous work indicates that they provide good prediction of mean epidemic sizes, though may potentially underestimate variability when compared with results on dynamic networks [38] . The advantage with a weighted static network approach is that it is possible to determine the epidemic impact independent of time of year. However, there is clear seasonality observed in the cattle movement network [49] , and it is therefore possible that a weighted static network could result in an under-or over-prediction of epidemic size. Our sensitivity analysis suggests that the preferred sampling strategies are robust, although the proportion of nodes that need to be sampled may vary dependent upon time of year. Future studies will focus upon constructing rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc. R. Soc. B 282: 20150205 a dynamic network, and testing network sampling schemes and temporal sampling schemes (whereby sampling is targeted based on time of year) on their ability to predict epidemic behaviour.

The results indicate that for a fast-spreading disease such as FMD, sampling a small proportion of the network is sufficient. This relies on the assumption that infected movements result in all livestock on the destination farm becoming rapidly infected. This is not the case for all livestock diseases. For example, animals infected with bTB can remain asymptomatic carriers for several months [13] before becoming infectious. The model framework described here would not be appropriate for a disease of this nature, and further work will focus upon the development of optimal sampling strategies for slow-spreading diseases such as bTB, where it may be crucial to track movements of individual cattle.

Our results suggest that for countries with similar farming practices, it may not be necessary to collect data on all livestock farms, but only those that contribute most significantly to the livestock trade. Of course, this creates something of a conundrum-in order to sample the most highly connected nodes, and thus accurately represent epidemic risk on an unknown network, one needs to know which farms have the most movements. One solution to this would be for all farmers to be required to record the number of movements they make in a given year. These summary statistics could then be used to determine which farms should be sampled for the following year. In the UK, at least, analysis of the movement network for multiple years suggests that those farms that have a high number of movements in a given year are more likely to have a high number of movements in the following year. This method may therefore be used in countries where livestock movement data are not currently available in order to inform epidemic models and predict the potential for disease spread owing to animal movements in the early stages of a disease outbreak.

Tick-Borne Flaviviruses and the Type I Interferon Response

Flaviviruses are globally distributed pathogens causing millions of human infections every year. Flaviviruses are arthropod-borne viruses and are mainly transmitted by either ticks or mosquitoes. Mosquito-borne flaviviruses and their interactions with the innate immune response have been well-studied and reviewed extensively, thus this review will discuss tick-borne flaviviruses and their interactions with the host innate immune response.

Tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFV), Flaviviridae family, includes many pathogens causing severe human disease, ranging from mild fever to encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever. There are more than 70 viruses in the genus flavivirus, and they are transmitted by arthropods such as mosquitoes (dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) and ticks (tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Langat virus (LGTV), Kyasanur forest disease virus (KFDV), Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV), Powassan virus (POWV), and Louping-ill virus (LIV)) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Among the TBFVs, TBEV, POWV, and LIV are encephalitic, whereas OHFV and KFDV are hemorrhagic viruses.

There are general features that distinguish TBFV from mosquito-borne. One such feature is that tick-borne viruses tend to persist in certain stable foci whereas mosquito-borne viruses may suddenly emerge and they can rapidly spread to new areas and continents causing large epidemics [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Mosquito-borne flaviviruses are transmitted horizontally from mosquito to vertebrate to mosquito, and for some viruses, humans act as the amplifying host [12] [13] [14] . Mosquitoes have a short life compared to ticks, as it can take several years for a tick to develop from egg to adult [15] . Ticks also only take one blood meal at each of their life stages, larvae, nymph, and adult, this means that tick-borne viruses need to be maintained in infected ticks during a very long time [16] . Thus, replication in ticks needs to be lower compared to mosquitoes, which have higher viral turnover and a faster generation cycle, this also contributes to the high mutation rate in mosquito-borne flaviviruses, and relative stable genomes of TBFVs [17, 18] . Infection of tick-borne flaviviruses usually cause a short viremia in humans and larger vertebrates. This route of transmission has been described as less important in tick-borne flavivirus infection [19] , instead TBEV has been shown to be transmitted by viremic rodents and among co-feeding ticks without viremia [20] . Humans act as dead-end hosts since they do not produce high enough viremia to transmit the virus to new ticks.

According to phylogenetic differences, TBEV has been divided into three different subtypes, European, Siberian, and Far Eastern. The European subtype is mainly transmitted by Ixodes ricinus, whereas the Siberian and Far Eastern subtypes are primarily transmitted by Ixodes persulcatus [21, 22] . TBEV is found in central, eastern, and northern Europe and Asia ( Figure 1 ) and correlates with the presence of infected ticks. Ixodes ricinus is found throughout Europe, whereas Ixodes persulcatus is found in Eastern Europe in the west, and China and Japan in the east [23] .

TBEV is considered one of the most important arboviruses in central and eastern European countries and in Russia, with about 13,000 estimated human cases annually [24] . In fact, over the last decade there has been an approximately 300% increase in the number of TBE cases in Europe [25] , and TBEV is currently spreading into new regions in France, Sweden, Norway, and Italy [26] [27] [28] [29] . This increase is thought to be due to growth in population and spread of ticks, which is promoted by factors including climate change, social and political change, and changes in the land use [30, 31] . The increased expansion in Europe also poses an increased risk for the population engaged in outdoor activities.

TBEV is a zoonotic disease and the natural cycle of TBEV is dependent and maintained in a complex cycle involving ticks as the vector and reservoir of the virus and small rodents as hosts for ticks [32] . Humans are not part of the natural transmission cycle of TBEV and are the incidental host when infected by a bite from an infected tick [33] . Transmission through consumption of unpasteurized milk has also been reported for TBEV [34, 35] , as well as transmission via solid organ transplant [36] .

During the tick bite, the virus is inoculated into the skin of the vertebrate host. The initial replication is believed to occur locally in the dendritic cells. This is followed by infection of the draining lymph nodes, resulting in the primary viremia and subsequent infection of the peripheral tissues, where further replication maintains the viremia for several days [37] [38] [39] [40] . The disease course of TBEV is biphasic; the initial phase is characterized by flu-like symptoms and is followed by a second phase involving CNS infection, with meningitis, encephalitis, or meningoencephalitis [41] [42] [43] . The mortality rate of TBEV varies from 1 to 20% depending on the subtype, in which the European TBEV subtype has shown lower mortality rates compared to the Siberian and Far Eastern [23, 40, 44] . Among the patients that experience neuroinvasive TBEV infection, approximately 25-40% of the survivors suffer from long lasting neurological sequelae [45, 46] . No antivirals are available for treatment of TBEV infection but there is an effective vaccine [25, 47] . LGTV, which is closely related to TBEV, is found in south east Asia and Russia [17] . LGTV has not been associated with human disease under natural infections although it shares 84% sequence identity with TBEV [17] . Because of its avirulence in humans and close similarity to TBEV, LGTV is often used as a model virus for TBEV under biosafety level-2 conditions.

POWV is found in Russia and North America, and is the only TBFV present in America ( Figure 1 ) [48] . It is transmitted by Ixodes scapularis, Ixodes cookei, and several other Ixodes tick species, to small and medium size mammals, whereas humans are accidental dead-end hosts. Milk-borne POWV transmission might also be possible since POWV virus has been found to be secreted in milk under experimental settings [49] .

Although not much is known about POWV pathogenesis, recent studies in mice have found that tick saliva was important to enhance POWV transmission and the outcome of disease [50] . Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that POWV infects macrophages and fibroblasts in the skin, shortly after the tick bite, also, other unidentified cells were shown to be infected [51] . Interestingly, macrophages were found to be the primary target for POWV in the spleen [52] , and in the CNS, which is the main target site for POWV infection, neurons have been shown to be the primary target for POWV in mice and humans [52, 53] .

During the last 10 years there has been an increase of POWV in the USA with approximately 100 reported cases [54, 55] . The recent rise in incidence could be due to increased surveillance and diagnosis of POWV, or it may represent a true emergence of the disease in endemic areas, or both [55] . The incubation period ranges from 1 week to 1 month. The symptoms of POWV infection may include fever, headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, seizures, and memory loss with a case fatality rate of 10% [54] . Approximately half of the survivors experience permanent neurological symptoms, such as recurrent headaches, muscle wasting, and memory problems (https://www.CDC.gov). There are no antiviral treatments or vaccines available against POWV.

LIV is mainly distributed in the UK and Ireland, but it has also been detected in sheep in Norway and on the Bornholm island in Denmark ( Figure 1 ). LIV is most commonly known as pathogen of sheep and red grouse although humans can also get infected [17, 56] . Animals develop a febrile disease, which can progress to fatal encephalitis [57] . Like TBEV, the vector of LIV is the tick species Ixodes ricinus [57] . Ticks transmit the virus to animals, however, natural exposure to humans is rare [33] . Instead humans that are exposed to infected animals such as veterinarians, farmers, butchers, and abattoir workers, as well as laboratory scientists have acquired LIV infection [58] [59] [60] [61] . In between the years of 1934 and 1991, 31 human cases of LIV was described [62] . In humans, LIV causes a disease that closely resembles TBEV, with initial flu-like symptoms which can progress to severe neurological disease. Distinct but closely related viruses are also found in Spain (Spanish sheep encephalomyelitis virus), Turkey (Turkish sheep encephalitis virus), and Greece (Greek goat encephalitis virus) [33] .

OHFV distribution is restricted to western Siberia ( Figure 1 ) [17] . The main vector of OHFV is the meadow tick, Dermacentor reticulatus, which can also transmit the virus to humans. However, humans are mainly infected after contact with infected muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) which are very sensitive to the infection and often succumb to the infection [63] . Muskrats develop high viremia which can last for several weeks. Human infection occurs through contact with urine, feces, and blood [63] . Secretion of OHFV in unpasteurized goat milk has been reported but no milk-borne outbreaks have been observed [63] . The exact number of annual cases are uncertain because of misdiagnoses and unreported cases, but 165 cases were reported between 1988 and 1997 [63] . OHFV may cause a biphasic disease; the initial phase is characterized by high fever, bleeding from the nose, mouth, and uterus. Thirty to fifty percent of the cases experience a second phase characterized by high fever and reappearance of the symptoms from the initial phase. Case fatality rates range from 0.5 to 2.5% [63] . No antiviral treatments are available against OHFV, instead treatment is focused on supportive care to minimize hemorrhage and other complications [17] .

KFDV is only found in India (Figure 1 ), although a similar genetic variant, Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV) has been detected in Saudi Arabia [17, 47] . KFDV is mainly transmitted by ticks belonging to the genus Hemaphysalis but other tick genera have also been shown to be able to transmit KFDV [64, 65] . During hemorrhagic KFDV infection, the initial phase is similar to TBEV infection with fever and flu-like symptoms, but it may also include bleeding from the nose, mouth or gastrointestinal tract [65, 66] . The second phase, which is experienced by 1-20% of the cases, includes neurological symptoms such as headache, mental disturbance, and tremor, however, no evidence of meninges or encephalitis have been found [65] . There are about 400-500 reported annual cases of KFDV [47] , with case fatality rates ranging from 3 to 10% [17, 65] . In 1990 a KFDV vaccine was developed, although it provided some protection, due to low efficacy, the number of cases still increased from 1999 to 2012 [67] [68] [69] . Treatment of KFDV is limited to supportive care [47] .

TBFVs are enveloped viruses around 50 nm in diameter. The envelope carries two surface proteins, the envelope (E) protein and the membrane (M) protein. The latter is derived from a precursor protein, prM. The nucleocapsid (NC) lies inside the viral envelope and consists of multiple copies of capsid (C) protein and the viral genome. The TBFV genomes are single stranded, positive-sense RNA of approximately 11,000 nucleotides. It has a 5 -cap with a single open reading frame (ORF). The ORF is flanked by 5 and 3 untranslated regions (UTRs). The viral protein is encoded by the ORF as a single polyprotein, which is co-and post-translationally cleaved by cellular and viral proteases into individual viral proteins (three structural and seven non-structural). The polyprotein is arranged in the order 5 -C-prM-E-NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5-3 [70, 71] .

The first step of virus replication starts when the virus binds to its receptor and is taken up into the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis. The attachment is mediated by viral E protein and entry receptor on the host cell. The entry receptor for TBFVs has not been identified, but attachment to heparan sulphate and glycosaminoglycan, which are present in abundance on many cell types of both vertebrates and ticks, is predicted to play a role during binding and entry [72] . Once the virus has entered the cell, it is transported to endosomes, where the acidic environment of these vesicles leads to reorganization and conformational change of the E protein, resulting in the fusion of the viral and endosomal membrane and the release of the viral capsid into the cytoplasm [73] [74] [75] . The viral RNA (vRNA) also functions as mRNA, associating with ribosomes to produce the polyprotein. The transmembrane domain of the viral protein is recognized as a signal peptide and recruits the vRNA/ribosomes/nascent polypeptide complex to the ER membrane, where it is co-translationally translocated into the ER membrane [76, 77] . The nascent polypeptide is then processed by the cellular and viral proteases into structural and non-structural (NS) viral proteins. Some of the viral proteins such as NS2B, NS4A, and NS4B integrate and alter the membrane of the ER to form a membrane vesicular structure, with a small pore connecting the interior of the vesicle to the cytoplasm [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] . These vesicles are the site for the formation of replication complexes (RC) and RNA replication [80, 82, 83] . Following RNA replication, genomic RNA is proposed to exit the vesicle through the vesicular pore and is packaged by C proteins into the NC on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane [82, 84, 85] . During the process of budding of NC from the cytoplasm into the ER, it acquires the lipid envelope along with E and prM proteins, which are associated with the ER membrane. The mechanism that ensures efficient incorporation of NC into the ER membrane with the E and prM protein is poorly understood. Following budding into the ER lumen, the immature virions are transported through the cellular secretory pathways in a COPI and COPII dependent manner [86] to the extracellular medium. The immature virion has heterodimers of E and prM that completely cover the lipid bilayer to form a spiky proteinaceous coat. During the transport through the Golgi, the E protein is glycosylated [87] . The acidic environment of the Golgi induces conformational changes in the E and prM proteins, which exposes a cleavage site on prM. Cleavage of prM by the cellular protease furin results in the formation of a mature virion [88, 89] . Mature virions are then released by exocytosis, which completes the viral life cycle [90] [91] [92] (Figure 2 ). 

In arthropods, such as mosquitos and ticks, RNA interferences (RNAi) are the most important antiviral defense and tick cells have been shown to mount RNAi responses against LGTV and TBEV [93] . Proteins involved in the RNAi mediated response such as Argonaute 30 (Ago30), Ago 16 and Dicer (Dcr) 90 were subsequently identified as inhibitors of LGTV [93] . Furthermore RNA-seq and mass spectrometric analysis revealed that when challenged by TBEV infection, tick cells upregulated genes involved in immunity and metabolism, whereas genes involved in cellular stress were downregulated [94] . Using gene silencing approaches, this study confirmed the antiviral effect of Ago 30 and Dcr 90 in tick cells. Furthermore, novel antiviral genes such as complement factor H, heat shock protein (HSP) 70 and 90 and trypsin was found to inhibit LGTV in tick cells [94] . Taken together, studies so far have identified activation and antiviral actions of the RNAi mediated response in tick cells as well as other inhibitory proteins such as HSP70, HSP90, and trypsin.

The innate immune response provides the first line of defense against viral infections. This defense includes physical and chemical barriers such as the skin and mucous membranes and the acidity of the stomach. They serve as an initial barrier that protects the host from infection. Once these barriers have been breached, the innate immune response relies on a set of germline-encoded receptors, known as pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize pathogen specific molecular patterns that are sensed as a danger signal by the host cell [95, 96] . Engagement of PRRs results in the activation of several defense mechanisms including, production of interferon (IFN), induction of phagocytosis, cytokines, chemokines, antimicrobial peptides, antiviral proteins, as well as activation of leukocytes and T-cells. Furthermore, the innate immune response harbors cellular components, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells [97] .

In 1957 Isaacs and Lindenmann discovered IFN as a secreted factor that interfered with viral replication [98] . In the early pioneer work on IFN in the fifties and sixties, TBEV served as a model system, and TBEV was shown to induce IFN after infection and was also sensitive to pretreatment of IFNs [80, [99] [100] [101] [102] . Pretreatment of IFN was also found to inhibit KFDV, OHFV, and POWV titers in A549 cells (adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells) [103] , thus IFN pretreatment induced broad spectrum inhibition of TBFVs. IFN has also been found to be strongly induced in the brains of POWV infected Peromyscus lecuopus, which are known as a natural host of the virus [104] . Similarly, IFN was found to be induced in sheep infected with LIV [105] , and IFN-stimulated genes were induced in brains of KFDV infected mice, indicating an activated IFN response [106] .

Three distinct classes of IFN, type I (IFN α and β), type II (IFNγ), and type III IFN (IFNλ) have been described. The expression of the IFNλ-receptors and IFNγ are restricted, but the type I IFNs can be expressed by most cell types and their receptor, the interferon-α/β receptor (IFNAR) is expressed on all nucleated cells [107] . There are 17 different type I IFNs in humans; these cytokines are produced by cells upon recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, which are foreign to the host cell [95, 108] , and mediates antiviral activity by autocrine and paracrine signaling through IFNAR [109, 110] . Signaling through IFNAR induces an antiviral state by the expression of hundreds of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) [111, 112] .

The host cell detects invading pathogens through PRRs, which recognize foreign molecular patterns that are generated during infection. The particular PRR involved in the recognition of the pathogen depends on the infecting virus [108] . In flavivirus infection, the most important PRRs are Toll-like receptor (TLR)3, TLR7, TLR8, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), and melanoma differentiation-associated protein-5 (MDA-5). TLR3 recognizes double stranded (ds) RNA, which is formed as an intermediate during flavivirus replication [113, 114] . TLR7 and 8, which are located in the endosomes, recognize single stranded (ss) RNAs, such as the genomic RNA of flaviviruses [95, [115] [116] [117] . RIG-I and MDA-5 recognize viral RNA in the cytoplasm of infected cells; RIG-I recognizes short dsRNA and 5 triphosphorylated and 5 diphosphorylated ssRNA, whereas MDA-5 recognizes long dsRNA [118] [119] [120] .

Upon recognition, the different PRR will recruit distinct adaptor molecules. TLR3 recruits TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF) [121] , TLR7 and 8 recruit myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (Myd88) [122] , whereas the RIG-I-like helicases, RIG-I and MDA-5, recruit interferon-beta promoter stimulator-1 (IPS-1) (also known as mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), virus-induced signaling adapter (VISA) and CARD adapter-inducing IFN-beta (Cardif)) [123] [124] [125] [126] . Ligation of PRRs and downstream recruitment of the adapter molecules result in the activation of transcription factors NF-κB and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3 and IRF7, which translocate to the nucleus and induces the expression and subsequent secretion of type I IFN [127] .

Although the innate antiviral response has been well-studied in mosquito-borne flavivirus infection, the responses to TBFVs are less investigated, and most studies have used TBEV which therefore will be the main focus of the remainder of this review.

In TBEV infection, IFNβ induction has been shown to correlate with amount of intracellular viral RNA, and the IPS-1 pathway has been shown to protect mice from lethal LGTV infection and prolong survival after TBEV infection [80, 128] . Absence of IPS-1 resulted in a lower systemic IFNα response, which correlated with higher viral replication in the peripheral tissues [128] . Furthermore, IPS-1 was shown to be of particular importance for the IFN production locally within the brain, where IPS-1 −/− mice had lower induction of IFNβ within the olfactory bulb despite higher viral burdens [128] . Furthermore, IFNβ induction was shown to be completely dependent on IPS-1 and IRF3 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and viral recognition through the IPS-1-pathway was shown to be dependent on RIG-I and not MDA-5 in human osteosarcoma cells (U2OS) [80, 83] . Interestingly, RIG-I has been shown to co-localize with stress granules (SG) during TBEV infection [129] . SG contains ribonucleoprotein aggregates with translationally stalled mRNAs, 40S ribosomes, and several RNA-binding proteins. SG function to prevent the generation of defective proteins [130] . SG are induced during TBEV infection and SG components TIA-1/TIAR was found to bind viral RNA and inhibit viral translation [131] .

Little is known about the role of the TLR7/8-Myd88 pathway in tick-borne flavivirus infection; however, TLR7 was shown to suppress LGTV replication within neurons of the brain although it did not affect pathogenesis [132] . What we are aware of; no animal experiments have shown any significance of the TLR3-TRIF pathway in tick-borne flavivirus infection. However, several studies have looked at the prevalence of polymorphisms in the TLR3 gene in TBE patients [133] [134] [135] [136] . In particular, one polymorphism has been investigated the T allele in rs3775291. This polymorphism has been shown to reduce TLR3 signaling by about 30% [137] . Although the data regarding TLR3 is somewhat conflicting, Grygorczuk et al. hypothesized that a functional TLR3 facilitates the onset of neurological disease [135] by supporting the penetration through the blood brain barrier, but has a protective effect during the established CNS infection [134] . The differences between studies might also be connected to the different subtypes of the TBEV strain and the genetic background of the studied populations [134] .

Taken together, studies so far have demonstrated the importance of the RIG-I-like-IPS-1 pathway in tick-borne flavivirus infection, whereas the role of the TLR pathways remains unclear.

After secretion, type I IFN signals in an autocrine and paracrine manner by binding to the heterodimeric IFNAR, which consists of two subunits, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 [138] . These subunits are associated with Janus activated kinases (JAK) localized in the cytoplasm; IFNAR1 interacts with tyrosine kinase-2 (Tyk2), whereas IFNAR2 interacts with JAK1. Ligation of IFNAR results in activation of Tyk2 and JAK1, which subsequently phosphorylate signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-1 and STAT-2. Phosphorylated STAT-1 and STAT-2 then form a heterodimer, which associates with IRF9 to form IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF3) that binds to the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) in the promoter of many ISGs to enhance the transcription of several hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes [110, 139, 140] . Together, these ISGs act to coordinate an antiviral response that is able to inhibit almost any step in the viral life cycle [140] .

The IFN response in vivo in mice is very important to protect mice from lethal infection with LGTV. Mice lacking IFNAR all succumbed within 6 days of infection, whereas 80% of WT mice (6-8-week-old) survived the infection. Interestingly, all IFNβ −/− mice survived the infection, demonstrating that the IFNαs can compensate for loss of IFNβ in LGTV infection. Furthermore, IFNAR was shown to be a critical determinant of LGTV tropism as LGTV RNA was found in all organs in the absence of IFNAR, whereas in WT, only low viral burdens can be detected in the olfactory bulb [99, 128, 141] . Using transgenic mice, it was further shown that the IFN response was needed both in the peripheral tissue, as well as locally in the CNS, in order to clear LGTV infection [99, 100] .

Within the CNS, LGTV mainly infected neurons [99, 128] , which is also the case in lethal TBEV infection of humans [142] . Although neurons remain the main target cell of TBEV, astrogliosis have been shown in post mortem human brains [142, 143] . In vitro studies on primary cortical astrocytes show a fast up regulation and secretion of IFN after TBEV infection, which is able to protect neighboring astrocytes and neurons from infection already 6 and 3 h post infection, respectively [100] . Astrocytes have been shown to be resistant to TBEV-induced cytopathic effects [144, 145] , and it was later shown that IFNAR expression protected the astrocytes from the virus-induced cytopathic effects [100] . Pretreatment of cells with IFNs strongly inhibits growth of most TBFVs in cell culture [100, 103, [146] [147] [148] [149] and this is due to the upregulation and concerted actions of several hundreds of ISGs. Only a few ISGs have been identified to play a role in TBEV and LGTV infection [86, 141, 147, 149, 150] . One of them, the 2 -5 -oligoadenylate synthetase (2 -5 -OAS) (OAS) is activated by double-stranded RNA, leading to the OAS protein polymerization into 2 -5 -linked oligoadenylates (2-5As) [151, 152] . These 2-5As activate RNase L, resulting in the degradation of viral RNA [153] . Several polymorphisms in the OAS genes have been shown to correlate with severe forms of TBE in patients [154] . Also, the murine isoform Oas1b, which is often lacking in inbred mice strains, confers strain dependent resistance against neurovirulence from far eastern TBEV [155] . Two other ISGs which have been shown to be antivirally active against TBEV are virus inhibitory protein endoplasmic reticulum associated interferon inducible (viperin) and tripartite motif-79α (TRIM79α).

The TRIM proteins are a family of proteins able to mediate antiviral activity against many different viruses [156] . The rodent specific TRIM79α was identified to interact with LGTV NS5 in a yeast two-hybrid screen. TRIM79α expression inhibited viral infection of LGTV and TBEV by mediating lysosomal dependent degradation of NS5. Interestingly this mechanism was quite specific to tick-borne flaviviruses as the mosquito borne WNV was not inhibited by TRIM79α nor did TRIM79α interact with NS5 of WNV [147] .

Viperin is highly conserved in evolution and was first identified as an IFN-inducible protein with antiviral activity against human cytomegalovirus in 2001 [157] . Over the last 17 years, viperin has gained lot of attention and was shown to exhibit broad antiviral activity [158] . Viperin is also known as one of the most highly upregulated genes after viral infection [146, 159] . Within the family of flaviviridae, viperin has been shown to inhibit several members, such as WNV [160] , DENV [161] , ZIKV [162] , hepatitis C virus [163] , and TBEV [86, 141, 149, 150] . Viperin is an iron sulphur protein with three domains; a N-terminus amphipathic alpha-helix which mediates the intracellular localization to the ER, a S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) radical domain [158, 164, 165] homologous to a family of proteins that use SAM as a cofactor [166] , and a highly conserved C-terminal domain, important for iron sulphur (Fe/S) maturation [149, 167] . Although viperin is able to inhibit several different viruses, the mechanism of action, the important motif in viperin and the step of viral life cycle inhibited differs for different viruses [158] . Viperin interacts with many viral and host factors for its antiviral function. TBEV replication is strongly inhibited by viperin, our research shows that viperin has no effect on the binding or entry of TBEV. However, viperin targets genome replication, packaging, and release of TBEV (Figure 3 ) [86, 149, 150] . Viperin specifically targets the plus-sense RNA synthesis with no significant effect on the negative-sense RNA of TBEV during genomic replication [149] . Viperin's Fe/S maturation is dependent on Ciao1 [149, 167] . The Fe/S cluster and a functional SAM domain of viperin is essential to inhibit the synthesis of the plus-sense RNA of TBEV [149] . However, the target for the radical SAM activity important for the antiviral activity of TBEV is currently unknown. The structure of viperin was recently characterized [168] , and based on similarities to other radical SAM enzymes, several different hypothesis have been put forward regarding the substrate of viperin and its antiviral activity [168] [169] [170] . However, none of these have shown importance in the context of mammalian viral infection. Although the exact mode of action against TBEV is not well understood, recent data indicates that viperin interacts with several viral proteins; both structural prM and E and non-structural NS2A, NS2B, and NS3. These interactions lead to a viperin-NS3 dependent degradation of viral proteins. The degradation of TBEV NS3 was shown to be proteasome dependent [150] (Figure 3) . Interestingly, IFN treatment induces an increase of TBEV capsid particles and this effect was found to be dependent on viperin. Viperin mediated this effect by interacting, via its N-terminus, with the cellular protein Golgi Brefeldin A resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1) [86] . GBF1 is a key protein in the cellular secretory pathway and essential in the life cycle of many RNA viruses, which utilize vesicular trafficking in their replication cycle and assembly process [171] [172] [173] [174] (Figure 3 ). Viperin targets the NS3 protein for proteasomal degradation which inhibits the synthesis of + strand RNA. Furthermore, NS3 interacts with E, NS2A, and NS2B and these proteins are degraded by viperin in a NS3-dependent manner. Viperin also interferes with particle assembly by inducing secretion of C particles in a COPII-dependent manner, independent of COPI. Viperin mediates this effect by interacting and sequestering GBF1. Red arrow = secretory pathway, blue arrow = "?" vesicular transport via unknown pathway.

Although viperin has been demonstrated to be antiviral active against many different viruses in vitro, few studies have investigated viperin's role in vivo. In TBFV infection, viperin was shown to control LGTV dissemination and replication in the brain after intraperitoneal administration, and viperin promoted survival after intracranial infection [141] . Interestingly, viperin has been shown to be expressed in the brain at the basal state [128] , with high basal expression in primary astrocytes [100, 141] . Viperin's role within the brain during neurotropic LGTV infection was further mapped to certain brain regions, as viperin inhibited viral replication in the olfactory bulb and cerebrum, but not in the cerebellum or brainstem. This correlates very well with TBEV infection since viperin strongly inhibited TBEV replication in primary neurons and astrocytes from the cerebrum, but not in granular cell neurons isolated from the cerebellum. Interestingly, cortical neurons were completely dependent on viperin for IFN-mediated inhibition of TBEV, whereas in astrocytes, in which the IFN-mediated antiviral activities are strongly dependent on viperin, other ISGs could partly compensate for loss of viperin [141] .

Taken together, viperin has been shown to be an ISG that strongly inhibits tick-borne flaviviruses in vivo and in vitro. This strong antiviral effect on TBEV is mediated by targeting the virus at multiple steps of the life cycle. Interestingly, viperin targeting the synthesis of plus-sense RNA is dependent on the SAM domain or the C-terminal domain, while the N-terminal domain of viperin is responsible for interfering with virus assembly and release.

In order to establish an infection, a pathogen needs to overcome or evade the innate immune response. To breach the very first line of defense, the skin-TBFVs use the tick to deliver the virus through the skin via tick saliva. Furthermore, tick saliva contains immunomodulatory compounds that enhance viral transmission and dissemination [175, 176] . Although there are several mechanisms in which mosquito-borne flaviviruses actively suppress the induction of type I IFN, no such mechanism has been identified in tick-borne flaviviruses so far [177] . Instead, TBEV, like other flaviviruses, utilizes a passive evasion mechanism in which the virus hides its dsRNA intermediates in vesicular structures inside the ER membranes, and thus delaying the recognition by the cytosolic RIG-I like receptors and subsequent IRF3 phosphorylation and IFN induction ( Figure 4A ) [80, 81, 83] .

The most conserved inhibition of the type I IFN system within the Flaviviridae family is the antagonism of IFNAR signaling carried out by NS5; this mechanism is conserved between several mosquito and tick-borne flaviviruses [148, [177] [178] [179] [180] [181] . In LGTV infection, NS5 was shown to inhibit the JAK-STAT pathway and NS5 was shown to interact with the IFNAR receptor [148] . Similarly, it was shown that NS5 of TBEV interacts with scribble (hScrib) which mediates NS5 localization to the plasma membrane and this interaction enables NS5 to inhibit type I and type II IFN mediated JAK-STAT signaling [178] . Knockdown of hScrib altered NS5 cellular localization and reversed the inhibition of the JAK-STAT signaling [178] . Further studies revealed that NS5 of TBEV inhibited the cell surface expression of IFNAR1 by binding to prolidase (PEPD) [182] . PEPD is a peptidase that is needed for IFNAR1 maturation and subsequent cell surface expression. NS5 binding of PEPD prevented maturation of complex N-linked oligosaccharides on IFNAR1, which in turn disrupted its surface expression ( Figure 4B ) [179, 182] . In KFDV infection, IFN treatment failed to reduce viral titers when added after infection, this effect was also found to be mediated by the NS5 proteins antagonism [180, 183] .

During TBFV infection, a subgenomic noncoding RNA is formed, called subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) [93, 184, 185] . It is produced as a product of incomplete degradation of genomic viral RNA by cellular 5 -3 exoribonuclease XRN1 [184] . The ability to produce sfRNA in WNV was shown to be needed for efficient viral growth in vitro and for pathogenicity in mice [184] . Interestingly, DENV sfRNA was found to bind to TRIM25 to inhibit RIG-I-induced type I interferon expression in Huh-7 cells [186] . Furthermore, DENV and WNV sfRNA was found to suppress the RNAi response in both mammalian and insect cells [187] . Similarly, in TBEV infection, sfRNA has been demonstrated to inhibit the antiviral RNAi response in tick cells [93] . PEPD is needed for maturation and subsequent transport of IFNAR1 to the plasma membrane. IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 heterodimer on plasma membrane can be activated by IFNα/β which leads to the signaling cascade and phosphorylation and translocation of STAT1/2-IRF9 into the nucleus and upregulation of ISGs. Right panel: NS5 interferes with IFN signaling. NS5 protein interacts with PEPD thus preventing IFNAR1 plasma membrane localization (red T). NS5 also prevents STAT1 phosphorylation (red T). Arrows indicate protein transport.

Even though recent studies have shed light on the role of innate immunity during tick-borne flavivirus infection, much remains unknown. For example, the role of the TLR-TRIF and TLR-MyD88 pathway in pathogenesis and viral recognition. Furthermore, most studies were performed using LGTV and TBEV, and although they are closely related to POWV, LIV, KFDV, and OHFV, their interactions with the innate immune response might differ. Although IFN has been shown to strongly control viral tropism and pathogenesis of tick-borne flaviviruses, few antiviral ISGs have been identified. Viperin has been shown to be the most important ISG in cortical neurons, however, other ISGs that target TBEV expressed in astrocytes and granular cell neurons are yet to be identified and very little is known about the early response against the hemorrhagic TBFVs. We also know very little about how the innate immune response regulates the neuroinvasion of neurotropic TBFV, and the specific interactions between the tick vector and the different viruses. 

Gene Expression Networks in the Murine Pulmonary Myocardium Provide Insight into the Pathobiology of Atrial Fibrillation

The pulmonary myocardium is a muscular coat surrounding the pulmonary and caval veins. Although its definitive physiological function is unknown, it may have a pathological role as the source of ectopic beats initiating atrial fibrillation. How the pulmonary myocardium gains pacemaker function is not clearly defined, although recent evidence indicates that changed transcriptional gene expression networks are at fault. The gene expression profile of this distinct cell type in situ was examined to investigate underlying molecular events that might contribute to atrial fibrillation. Via systems genetics, a whole-lung transcriptome data set from the BXD recombinant inbred mouse resource was analyzed, uncovering a pulmonary cardiomyocyte gene network of 24 transcripts, coordinately regulated by chromosome 1 and 2 loci. Promoter enrichment analysis and interrogation of publicly available ChIP-seq data suggested that transcription of this gene network may be regulated by the concerted activity of NKX2-5, serum response factor, myocyte enhancer factor 2, and also, at a post-transcriptional level, by RNA binding protein motif 20. Gene ontology terms indicate that this gene network overlaps with molecular markers of the stressed heart. Therefore, we propose that perturbed regulation of this gene network might lead to altered calcium handling, myocyte growth, and contractile force contributing to the aberrant electrophysiological properties observed in atrial fibrillation. We reveal novel molecular interactions and pathways representing possible therapeutic targets for atrial fibrillation. In addition, we highlight the utility of recombinant inbred mouse resources in detecting and characterizing gene expression networks of relatively small populations of cells that have a pathological significance. KEYWORDS pulmonary myocardium eQTL atrial fibrillation gene network

In mammals, the pulmonary myocardium forms an atriovenous junction where the atrial myocardium extends into the vena cavae and pulmonary veins, forming a sleeve of myocardial tissue around the veins (Nathan and Eliakim 1966) . This myocardial sleeve is thought to maintain venous pressure and prevent blood reflux from the atrium during contraction (Nathan and Eliakim 1966) . Interestingly, autonomous electrical activity (Brunton and Fayrer 1876) and ectopic beats originating from the pulmonary myocardium (Chen et al. 1999 ) are implicated in atrial fibrillation. This is important because it has been estimated that atrial fibrillation affects .33 million people globally (Chugh et al. 2014) . Further, atrial fibrillation is associated with stroke, heart failure, significant morbidity, and increased mortality, leading to an estimated annual cost of $6.65 billion in the United States in 2005 (Reynolds and Essebag 2012). A number of studies have attempted to characterize and define the involvement of the pulmonary myocardium in atrial fibrillation (Chen et al.

cells are difficult to analyze in situ and have not been extensively studied in the endogenous context.

Analyses of the prevalence, length, and thickness of myocardial extensions has resulted in conflicting reports as to whether various parameters do (Hassink et al. 2003; Kholová and Kautzner 2003) or do not (Kholová and Kautzner 2004; Saito et al. 2000) correlate with atrial fibrillation. However, mutations in genes encoding the transcription factors Nkx2-5 (Huang et al. 2013; Xie et al. 2013) , Pitx2c (Qiu et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2014) , and GATA6 ) are all associated with atrial fibrillation; these genes are known to be required for cardiovascular development. These data suggest that perturbation of the transcriptional program associated with cardiac muscle (but not necessarily disrupting morphology) may underlie the association of the pulmonary myocardium with atrial fibrillation. Consistent with this, both PITX2C and NKX2-5 are required to direct and maintain the identity of the pulmonary myocardium (Mommersteeg et al. 2007) . Lost or reduced expression of NKX2-5 causes pulmonary myocardium cells to adopt a pacemaker-like phenotype similar to cells of the sinus horn myocardium, without altering cellular morphology (Mommersteeg et al. 2007; Ye et al. 2015) . This implies that healthy pulmonary myocardium could gain pacemaker function from which an ectopic beat might originate via a shift in the gene expression program away from that of working myocardium and toward a pacemaker program. Thus, molecular analysis of pulmonary myocardium cells in vivo is warranted and could provide a powerful tool for understanding the pathobiology of atrial fibrillation and identifying novel therapeutic targets. This led us to investigate gene regulatory mechanisms that might drive the expression of cardiac genes in this tissue.

In this study, we used a systems-genetics approach to conduct complex trait analysis and uncover gene networks in the pulmonary myocardium in situ (Chesler et al. 2005; Sieberts and Schadt 2007) . Systems-genetics approaches use genetic reference populations such as the BXD resource, a set of recombinant inbred mice which are the progeny of an intercross between the two parental mouse strains C57BL/6J and DBA/2J (Andreux et al. 2012; Peirce et al. 2004) . Recombinant inbred strains like the BXD and the Collaborative Cross (Ram et al. 2014; Threadgill et al. 2011 ) are especially suited for systems-genetics studies because each strain is effectively immortal (Andreux et al. 2012) . They provide a powerful test bed for linking genetic loci to variation, including mapping loci controlling gene expression levels. Such loci are termed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) (Chesler et al. 2005) . Importantly, analyses of eQTL provide a means for detecting specific regulators of a gene of interest as well as identification of networks of coregulated transcripts (Andreux et al. 2012; Hall et al. 2014) .

We have analyzed a publicly available BXD steady-state, whole-lung transcriptome data set generated from 51 BXD strains (Alberts et al. 2011) to interrogate the molecular phenotype of the pulmonary myocardium. Based on the assumption that genes with highly correlated expression in a tissue are likely to act in a common network or biological process, Alberts et al. (2011) previously identified gene networks associated with specific B-and T-cell populations from this same whole-lung data set. We reasoned that we could use a similar approach with the lung data set to identify and characterize pulmonary myocardium cells using the cardiac troponin I type 3 (Tnni3) gene (previously shown to be expressed in pulmonary myocardium) (Millino et al. 2000) by investigating highly correlated transcripts associated with cardiac muscle. This yielded 24 transcripts significantly correlated with the expression of Tnni3, which form the basis of a pulmonary myocardium gene network.

Analysis of public data sets The GeneNetwork suite of online programs, incorporating WebQTL (Chesler et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2003) , was used to analyze the publicly available BXD lung transcriptome data set (GN160) (www.genenetwork. org/webqtl/main.py) generated by Alberts et al. (2011) . Genome-wide association analyses were performed using gene expression microarray values measured on a log 2 scale. Correlation analysis was performed with Pearson's correlation, and outliers were removed. For interval mapping, likelihood ratio statistic (LRS) scores were plotted on the y-axis vs. chromosomal location on the x-axis (autosomes and X chromosome). An LRS score .17 was significant and an LRS score .10 was suggestive at a genome-wide P value of ,0.05 using 5000 permutations. LRS scores were computed using Haley-Knott regression (Haley and Knott 1992) . The genomic intervals analyzed were selected based on the location at which the eQTL peak crossed the suggested or significant LRS threshold. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to merge multiple gene expression traits into a single, synthetic trait that represented a cellspecific gene expression signature.

First-pass assessment of gene function was obtained from the GeneCards database (www.genecards.org) (Safran et al. 2010 ) and a tissue expression profile was analyzed using the Fantom5 database (http://fantom. gsc.riken.jp/zenbu/) (Forrest et al. 2014; Severin et al. 2014) . The top 100 transcripts (mapping to 78 unique genes) that correlated with the pulmonary myocardium PCA trait were submitted for enrichment analyses and gene ontology (GO) using the WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit (WebGestalt) . This resource incorporates information from different public databases including the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), WikiPathways, and human phenotype ontology. We also used the oPOSSUM-3 Webbased tool (Kwon et al. 2012) to identify overrepresentation of transcription factor binding sites and integrated ChIP-seq data from two previously published data sets (Dupays et al. 2015; He et al. 2011) .

Mouse experiments were approved by the University of Western Australia's Animal Ethics Committee. Four $8-wk-old male BALB/c mice were killed with an overdose of pentobarbitone (160 mg/kg via intraperitoneal injection) and fixed by cardiac perfusion with heparinized phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (15 IU/ml; heparin) followed by fixative (2% paraformaldehyde with 0.2% picric acid in PBS, pH 7.4). Heart and lungs were excised and postfixed for 48 hr at 4°in the same fixative. Tissue was washed, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin wax. Five-micrometerthick sections through lungs or ventricular myocardium (control) were cut and mounted onto Superfrost Plus microscope slides (Sigma-Aldrich).

The distribution of TNNI3 in BALB/c lung tissue was detected with a mouse monoclonal IgG 2a antibody (Abcam, clone 4C2). Briefly, sections were dewaxed, rehydrated, and subjected to 20 min of heatinduced epitope retrieval (HIER) (pressure cooker) in Tris buffered saline (TBS)/EDTA buffer, pH 9.0 (Vector Laboratories). After 15 min cooling at room temperature, sections were washed in TBS (pH 7.4) and incubated in anti-TNNI3 primary antibody or mouse IgG isotype control (2 mg/ml in 3% fish skin gelatin in TBS) overnight at 4°. Sections were then washed in TBS for 1 hr before incubating in Mouse on Mouse Polymer (Abcam) for 30 min, washed in TBS, and incubated with diaminobenzidine (0.4 mg/ml, 3 min). Sections were counterstained with Mayers hematoxylin, blued with Scotts Tap Water Substitute, washed and dehydrated through graded alcohols to xylene, then coverslipped with Depex mounting medium. Cardiac a-actin (ACTC1) was detected with a mouse monoclonal IgG 1 antibody (Simga-Aldrich, clone Ac1-20.4.2), or mouse isotype control at 5 mg/ml, with the same protocol as above but with HIER in citrate buffer with pH 6.0 (Vector Laboratories). The presence of smooth muscle a-actin (ACTA2) was detected in a similar fashion, using mouse monoclonal IgG 2a antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, clone 1A4) at 9 mg/ml, and detection as above, but without HIER. Tissue was permeablized with 1% Triton X-100 for 15 min prior to the application of the primary antibody. Digital images were acquired on an Aperio ScanScope XT digital slide scanner (Leica Technologies). Images are typically of the left lobe and right middle lobe of four mice.

All data used for this project are publicly available and accessible online (GN accession no. GN160).

Tnni3 can be used to identify a pulmonary myocardium gene network Since the expression of TNNI3 has previously been used as a marker for pulmonary myocardium (Millino et al. 2000; Mommersteeg et al. 2007; Ye et al. 2015) , we reasoned that genes with expression that correlated with Tnni3 expression (trait ID 1422536_at, mean expression 11.552) Figure 1 Identification of a pulmonary myocardium gene network. The top 100 transcripts that correlated with Tnni3 in the BXD whole-lung transcriptome data set were used to generate a network graph. This resulted in a network of 24 transcripts with a Pearson correlation .0.8. (A) These 24 transcripts were subsequently regraphed to interrogate relationships at Pearson correlation values between 0.7 and 1.0 (red lines) and between 0.5 and 0.7 (orange lines). (B) The functional relationships of the 21 proteins translated from these 24 transcripts were also identified. All proteins except DOC2G and MYBPHL had known roles in cardiac function including structural sarcomeric proteins, regulation of sarcomere assembly, ion transport, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, and hormone signaling.

in the whole-lung data set would also be expressed in the pulmonary myocardium. We performed sample correlation in the BXD data set and returned the top 100 significantly correlated transcripts (Supplemental Material, Table S1 in File S2; P , 0.0005). This set of 100 transcripts was enriched for genes known to be associated with cardiac muscle function, including structural proteins (actin and myosin), ion transporters (ryanodine receptors, calcium, and potassium transporters), and transcription factors (Hand2 and Nkx2-5). To define genes within this list that were likely to act in a concerted manner in the pulmonary myocardium, we generated a network graph and found 24 transcripts that were significantly associated at a Pearson correlation .0.8. These 24 transcripts were subsequently regraphed with lower stringency to visualize potential relationships between them ( Figure 1A ). Three transcripts (Tnnt2, Pln, and Kcnj3) were detected by two separate probes and thus the 24 transcripts corresponded to only 21 unique genes. All 21 genes have previously been reported to be expressed in cardiac muscle (Chopra and Knollmann 2013; Ding et al. 2010; Fukuda and Mikoshiba 2000; Greulich et al. 2011; Guo et al. 2013; Hennessey et al. 2013; Holmegard et al. 2010; Huh et al. 2012; Marx et al. 2000; Reiser et al. 2001; Sequeira et al. 2015; Shaikh et al. 2016; Stobdan et al. 2015; Takeda et al. 2003; Warren et al. 2012; Yamashita et al. 2003; Zhou and Wu 2014) ( Figure 1B and Table 1 ); all were highly significantly correlated with Tnni3 (P , 3.02e 28 ). These genes can be loosely clustered into functional categories including structural sarcomeric proteins, regulation of sarcomere assembly, ion transport, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, and hormone signaling (Table 1) .

To ensure that the muscle-related transcripts that we had identified were indeed associated with the pulmonary myocardium and not the smooth muscle present in small arteries and surrounding the bronchus, we performed correlation analysis using Acta2. The top 100 transcripts correlated with Acta2 were enriched for smooth muscle-associated genes [including gamma-actin 2 (Actg2), leiomodin (Lmod2), transgelin (Tagln), and calponin 1 (Cnn1)], and did not significantly overlap with Tnni3-correlated transcripts (Table S2 in File S2).

Modulates the interaction between actin and myosin to regulate power output (Sequeira et al. 2015 In sum, the identity of the Tnni3-correlated genes themselves, and their distinct expression compared to smooth muscle-associated genes, strongly supports that we have identified a network of genes expressed in the pulmonary myocardium.

The pulmonary myocardium gene network is coregulated from loci on Chr1 and Chr2 We next investigated whether transcripts within the pulmonary myocardium gene network were coregulated. Pair-wise comparisons were performed using a matrix function. All probe pairs within this set of 24 transcripts were positively correlated ( Figure S1 in File S1). All pairs had a Pearson correlation .0.5 with the exception of Myl4 and Doc2G (0.486), and Myl4 and Rbm20 (0.495). Further, heat-map analysis of eQTL for all 24 transcripts highlighted prominent regions of shared covariance on Chr1 and 2 with possible minor regions on Chr3, Chr4, Chr13, and Chr17 ( Figure 2A ). This suggested that expression levels of multiple transcripts in this gene network were coordinately regulated by a shared set of cis and trans eQTL.

To identify the genomic intervals harboring genes that mediated variable expression, we performed genome-wide interval mapping and marker regression analyses for each transcript. The expression level of all transcripts varied by greater than twofold between BXD strains ( Table  2) . All transcripts except one (Sln, sarcolipin) had either a suggestive (LRS .10.4) or significant (LRS .17) eQTL that mapped to the hotspot regions on Chr1 and Chr2 identified in the cluster map (Table  2) . One transcript, Myh6 (myosin heavy chain 6, Chr14), varied by 2.62-fold between the highest and lowest expressing BXD strains (Figure 2B) , such that a significant trans eQTL could be mapped to Chr1: 33 6 1 Mb ( Figure 2C ). Of the remaining transcripts, 11 also had a suggestive eQTL overlapping the Chr1: 33 6 1 Mb region (Table 2) . Two additional transcripts had significant eQTL mapping to Chr1 (Doc2g, Chr19; Trnd, Chr10) but these did not overlap and were not replicated in more than one other transcript (Table 2) . Two transcripts, Kcnj3 and Tnni3 (Chr2 and Chr7, respectively), had overlapping significant eQTL on Chr2. For example, Tnni3 expression varied by 2.35fold between strains ( Figure 2D ) and a trans eQTL was mapped to Chr2: 68.8 6 0.4 Mb ( Figure 2E ). Of the remaining transcripts, 12 also had a suggestive eQTL overlapping the Chr2: 68.8 6 0.4 Mb region (Table 2) . A second eQTL peak on Chr2: 77.5 6 1 Mb also reached significance for one gene (Mybpc3, Chr2) and was a suggestive eQTL for seven additional transcripts (Table 2 ). Using the Tnni3 eQTL plot as an example, this Chr2: 77.5 6 1 Mb region had a suggestive LRS ( Figure  2F ). Since three significant eQTL intervals (Chr1: 33 6 1 Mb, Chr2: 68.8 6 0.4 Mb, and Chr2: 77.5 6 1 Mb) were mapped with suggestive LRS in multiple pulmonary myocardium transcripts, the genes within these regions were interrogated to identify putative upstream regulatory genes.

Rab23, Zfp451, Nostrin, Lrp2, and Ttn are candidate regulators of the pulmonary myocardium gene network The genes within the peak linkage regions were subsequently analyzed for known biological functions (GeneCards) (Safran et al. 2010 ) and expression in lung tissue [Fantom5 (Forrest et al. 2014; Severin et al. 2014) ; Table 3 ]. The Chr1: 33 6 1 Mb interval contained nine genes, with five of these (Prim2, Rab23, Bag2, Zfp451, and Dst) expressed in adult lung (Table 3) . Both Rab23 and Zfp451 have known functions that could implicate them in regulating gene expression of the pulmonary myocardium network. RAB23, a GTPase of the RAB family involved in vesicular trafficking, also exerts downstream transcriptional effects by antagonizing the action of the transcription factor GLI1 (Sun et al. 2012) . However, the function, localization, and mechanisms of action of RAB23 are still largely undefined. On the other hand, ZFP451 (zinc finger protein 451) is a promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body-associated transcriptional coregulator, and modulates transcription by regulating protein subnuclear localization (Karvonen et al. 2008) .

The Chr2: 68.8 6 0.4 Mb interval contained nine genes, three of which were expressed at appreciable levels in adult lung (Lass6, Nostrin, and Lrp2) but only two had known roles in gene regulation (Nostrin) or cell signaling (Lrp2) ( Table 3) . Nostrin has been shown to be required for vascular development and angiogenesis by acting as a molecular conduit for fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1)-mediated induction of Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1) activity (Kovacevic et al. 2012) . Interestingly, Nostrin has been shown in both mice (Kim et al. 2005 ) and humans (Wiesenthal et al. 2009 ) to bind to and negatively regulate transcription of its own promoter via a centrally located bZIP DNA binding motif (Bae et al. 2014) .

However, transcriptional targets apart from Nostrin itself have not yet been found. LRP2 (low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2) is a critical component of the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway (Christ et al. 2012) . There is some evidence that LRP2 can shed its intracellular domain, which then shuttles to the nucleus where it may interact with as-yet-unidentified transcription factors (Li et al. 2008 ). However, a role for LRP2 has not yet been identified in either heart or lung. The Chr2: 77.5 6 1 Mb region contained six genes, only two of which were expressed in adult lung (Ttn and Ccdc141; Table 3 ). Of these, titin (Ttn) was a likely candidate modifier based on its role as a key integrator of myocyte signaling pathways (Linke 2008; Miller et al. 2004) . Therefore, Rab23, Zfp451, Nostrin, Lrp2, and Ttn were analyzed further.

The transcription factors NKX2-5, SRF, MEF2A, TEAD1, and NR2F1 potentially cooperate to specify and/or maintain pulmonary myocardium identity Since NKX2-5 has previously been shown to be important for the maintenance of pulmonary myocardium cell identity, we investigated the possibility that genes within the pulmonary myocardium, and the candidate upstream regulators, might be direct targets of NKX2-5. To this end, we interrogated previously published NKX2-5 ChIP-seq data derived from two sources. He et al. (2011) used a doxycycline-inducible dual adenovirus system to express biotinylated NKX2-5 in the HL1 cardiomyocyte cell line, while Dupays et al. (2015) examined endogenous NKX2-5 binding in mouse hearts at embryonic day 11.5.

Of the 21 genes in our gene network, NKX2-5 binding sites were detected within 10 kb of seven genes (Rbm20, Corin, Myl7, Tnnt2, Ryr2, Fgf12, and Myh7) in the He et al. data set, two genes (Mybpc3 and Trdn) in the Dupays et al. data set, and three genes (Tbx20, Mybphl, and Atp2a2) in both data sets (Dupays et al. 2015; He et al. 2011) (Table  4) . Collectively, this indicates that at least 50% of the genes in the pulmonary myocardium gene network are bound by NKX2-5 in heart tissue at some point during development. We also examined NKX2-5 enrichment at our candidate pulmonary myocardium control loci on Chr1 and Chr2 and found NKX2-5 enrichment at Rab23, Zfp451, and Nostrin in the He et al. data set. Although tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms may differ between the heart and the pulmonary myocardium, this is strong evidence to support the theory that NKX2-5 could directly regulate expression of the pulmonary myocardium gene network.

To further define transcriptional programs that might specify pulmonary myocardium identity, we performed transcription factor binding site enrichment analysis. We used the oPOSSUM-3 Web-based tool (Kwon et al. 2012) to identify overrepresented, conserved transcription factor binding sites in our set of 21 pulmonary myocardium genes and five candidate modifier genes. The pulmonary myocardium gene network was enriched in binding site sequences for SRF (serum response n 

and Dupays et al. (2015) data sets, we also investigated their enrichment in the genomic regions proximal to our genes of interest. Either one or both factors were enriched in 17 out of 21 genes (Table 4) . Therefore, these transcription factors could form part of a regulatory network that directs or maintains the identity of the pulmonary myocardium.

We subsequently investigated the expression of Nkx2-5, Srf, Mef2a, Tead1, and Nr2f1 in the lung using the Fantom5 mouse promoterome database (data not shown). At the transcript level, the expression of all factors except Nkx2-5 could be detected in the lung (lung, adult: CNhs10474 ctss). The absence of Nkx2-5 expression in adult lung is an apparent paradox since this factor has previously been shown to be required for pulmonary myocardium identity (Millino et al. 2000; Mommersteeg et al. 2007 ). However, whether the lung sections sampled in the Fantom5 project actually contain pulmonary myocardium cannot be determined. In contrast, Nkx2-5 low-level expression in the BXD lung data set could be detected with a mean of 7.798 log 2 units [background is generally considered to be ,7 log 2 units (Geisert et al. 2009) ]. Further, Nkx2-5 expression in the lung data set was significantly positively correlated with almost all the members of the pulmonary myocardium gene network (Table 4 ).

The pulmonary myocardium gene network and coexpressed genes are associated with cardiac phenotypes overlapping those of the stressed heart A limitation to single trait/transcript analysis is that it does not allow for combinatorial interactions with additional genetic loci, because each trait is individually regressed against every marker, i.e., only one locus is considered per trait (Michaelson et al. 2009 ). Therefore, all n 24 pulmonary myocardium gene network transcripts were merged into a single trait using PCA. A network of 100 probes that correlated (r . 0.553, P , 2.40e 205 ) with the synthetic PCA trait was identified.

Of the 100 probes, 76 had unique Entrez Gene IDs (Table S3 in File S2). These genes were considered to be part of a pulmonary myocardium gene coexpression network. This extended gene network contained a number of transcription factors (Tbx5, Hand2, Fhl2, and Gata4) and ion/calcium handling genes (Ank2, Cacna2d2, Scn5a, Kcnd2, Kcnj5, Myoz2, Casq2, Csrp3, and Gja3) of interest in the context of atrial fibrillation. We used this pulmonary myocardium gene coexpression network to investigate enriched GO terms, signaling pathways, and human phenotypes related to the coexpression of these genes in the lung using WebGestalt . The pulmonary myocardium gene coexpression network was significantly enriched with GO terms involving biological processes related to both striated and cardiac muscle function and development (Table 5) . Enriched molecular functions included cytoskeletal protein binding and cation transmembrane transporter activity (Table 5) , and enriched cellular components included contractile fiber and sarcomeric genes (Table 5) . Collectively, these data support our approach for identifying genes that are likely to be expressed in the pulmonary myocardium, as our coexpressed genes are indeed enriched for cardiac muscle function.

Interrogation of related signaling pathways with the KEGG pathway tool revealed enrichment for "dilated cardiomyopathy," "cardiac muscle contraction," "hypertrophic cardiomyopathy," and "calcium signaling pathway" genes (Table 5) . Similarly, analyses with the WikiPathway tool demonstrated enrichment for "striated muscle contraction" and "calcium regulation in the cardiac cell" (Table 5 ). In agreement with the GO and pathway results, the pulmonary myocardium gene coexpression network was enriched with higher order muscle phenotypes such as "abnormal cardiac muscle contractility," "abnormal cardiac tissue morphology," and "abnormal heart size" (Figure 3 ). Enrichment for pathways related to both abnormal contractility and calcium signaling/regulation led us to investigate the ion channels and regulatory proteins expressed in the extended gene network.

The expression of calcium handling networks in the pulmonary myocardium are dysregulated in atrial fibrillation We chose to investigate the potential for genes involved in ion transport and calcium handling to be dysregulated in atrial fibrillation. We selected 16 genes which are known to be involved in regulation of ion transport, almost all of which are also known susceptibility genes for arrhythmia (Table 6) Wang et al. 1995) , and analyzed their expression in a publicly available mRNA microarray data set generated by Deshmukh et al. (2015) . This study used RNA extracted from left atrial appendage tissue obtained from cardiac surgery patients who were divided into three categories: those with atrial fibrillation who either were or were not in sinus rhythm at the time tissue samples were collected, and those with no history of atrial fibrillation. The patient cohorts represent susceptibility to atrial fibrillation and persistent atrial fibrillation, respectively, when compared to control samples with no history of atrial fibrillation (Deshmukh et al. 2015) . We compared our genes of interest (Table 6 ) to expression changes in this data set to determine if genes in our network are likely to be n Table 4 ChIP-seq enrichment of Nkx2-5, Srf, and Mef2a in genomic regions proximal to genes within the pulmonary myocardium gene network and candidate upstream regulators dysregulated in atrial fibrillation. Of these 16 genes, four were significantly downregulated (Cacna2d2, 0.5-fold; Kcnj5, 0.7-fold; Myoz2, 0.7fold; and Sln, 0.7-fold) and three were significantly upregulated (Atp2a2, 1.6-fold; Csrp3, 1.8-fold; and Gja3, 1.6-fold) in the persistent atrial fibrillation cohort compared to either the susceptibility or the control cohorts (Table 6) .

We also compared our original gene network, putative upstream regulators, and transcription factors from the extended gene network with the Deshmukh et al. data set and found three genes were upregulated (Myh7, 1.8-fold; Ttn, 1.8-fold; and Fhl2, fourfold) and five genes were downregulated (Rbm20, 0.6-fold; Tnnt2, 0.6-fold; Fndc5, 0.7-fold; Mybphl, 0.5-fold; and Tbx5, 0.7-fold) in the persistent atrial fibrillation cohort compared to either the susceptibility or the control cohorts (Deshmukh et al. 2015) .

The dysregulation of these genes in atrial tissue of patients with persistent atrial fibrillation, especially Ttn which we propose acts upstream of many of the genes in our network, highlights the need for similar gene expression studies to be performed with pulmonary myocardium tissue.

Gene network analysis effectively identifies markers expressed in the pulmonary myocardium from wholelung transcriptome data To confirm that our analyses have, in fact, identified genes expressed in the pulmonary myocardium, lung tissue samples were analyzed from four BALB/c mice using immunohistochemistry to detect the cellular localization of TNNI3 and ACTC1. ACTC1 was selected as its transcript was highly expressed in the lung data set (12.422 units) and was part of n our pulmonary myocardium gene coexpression network (Table S3 in File S2). Further, Actc1 has previously been shown to be a direct target of NKX2-5 (Chen et al. 1996) . To differentiate between the pulmonary myocardium and typical smooth muscle, we also examined the localization of ACTA2. Cardiac ventricular tissue was used as a positive control for cardiomyocyte (TNNI3 and ACTC1) and smooth muscle (ACTA2) immunostaining ( Figure S2 in File S1). Distinct cell-type localization of TNNI3 and ACTA2 was observed in lung samples from four BALB/c mice (Figure 4 ; representative image from one mouse shown). A thin muscle coat staining positively for ACTA2 was situated beneath the columnar epithelium ( Figure 4A , black filled arrow) typical of bronchi and bronchioles in BALB/c mice (Rockx et al. 2007) . Consistent with previous reports describing the pulmonary vein myocardium (Kracklauer et al. 2013; Mueller-Hoecker et al. 2008 ), a thick muscle coat positively staining for TNNI3 was situated beneath a monolayer of endothelium lining the vein lumen (Mueller-Hoecker et al. 2008) ( Figure 4B , white filled arrow). This myocardial layer also stained positively for ACTC1 ( Figure 4C , white filled arrow), and contained visible striations ( Figure 4C , insert with Ã ) previously reported to be evident in pulmonary vein myocardium (Kracklauer et al. 2013; Mueller-Hoecker et al. 2008) . Weak staining of ACTC1 but not TNNI3 was detected in bronchial smooth muscle cells (Figure 4 , B and C, black filled arrow). No positive staining was detected with an isotype control antibody ( Figure 4D ).

Numerous studies now indicate that polymorphisms in genes encoding the cardiac transcription factors NKX2-5 and PITX2C increase susceptibility to atrial fibrillation (Huang et al. 2013; Qiu et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2014; Xie et al. 2013) , suggesting the potential involvement of disrupted gene networks in this disorder. Both factors are required for development of the pulmonary myocardium (Mommersteeg et al. 2007; Ye et al. 2015) , which is also thought to have a pathological role in atrial fibrillation (Chen et al. 1999) . A large body of literature has also been amassed to show that variants in genes regulating calcium handling lead to arrhythmia (Table 6 ). However, how the pulmonary myocardium gains pacemaker activity in atrial fibrillation patients is still unknown. Further, the underlying molecular identity of the pulmonary myocardium, including which ion channels and transcription factors are expressed in this tissue, has not been described in detail. We have used a systems-genetics approach to examine a large network of coexpressed genes simultaneously without prior knowledge of their identity, and have attempted to shed light on the relationships between transcriptional regulation, ion/calcium handling, contractile phenotypes, and the gene networks involved. By correlating variation in gene expression and known BXD genotypes in a genome-wide eQTL analysis we identified three regulatory loci associated with the expression of a cardiac gene network in the pulmonary myocardium.

The best candidate gene in the Chr2: 68.8 6 0.4 Mb interval was Nostrin which is expressed in endothelial cells, heart, and highly n Table 6 The pulmonary myocardium gene coexpression network contains genes involved in ion transport that are associated with arrhythmia and dysregulated in atrial vascularized tissues including the lung (Zimmermann et al. 2002) , and has clear potential as a regulatory molecule. A primary function of NOSTRIN is to modulate the activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) by sequestering eNOS away from the plasma membrane (Zimmermann et al. 2002) . In turn, this prevents the calcium-mediated release of nitric oxide (NO) (Zimmermann et al. 2002) , a potent modifier of cardiac function, including regulation of contractility (Massion et al. 2003; Petroff et al. 2001) . Alternative splicing of Nostrin produces a truncated isoform (NOSTRIN-b) which is primarily localized to the nucleus (Wiesenthal et al. 2009 ) and represses transcription from its own promoter (Kim et al. 2005; Wiesenthal et al. 2009 ). Therefore NOSTRIN-b could also influence transcription of other genes within the pulmonary myocardium gene network. A model can be envisaged where NOSTRIN-b alters expression of RBM20 (the linkage peak for the Rbm20 eQTL contains Nostrin), leading to altered splicing of Nostrin (as well as other key myocyte genes), to provide feedback from stretch-induced NO release and result in altered contractile properties. Interestingly, RBM20 has been shown to directly influence alternative splicing of Zfp451 and Ttn (Guo et al. 2013) , both of which were identified as candidate upstream regulators in the other two eQTL peaks identified in this study. The eQTL interval located at Chr1: 33 6 1 Mb contained two possible candidates for regulating expression of the pulmonary myocardium gene network: Rab23 and Zfp451. Since a defined relationship exists between ZFP451 and cardiac function, we suggest that ZFP451 is the better candidate. ZFP451 has been shown to bind directly to SMAD3/4 which prevents recruitment of p300 to target promoters and results in the downregulation of transforming growth factor-b (TGFb) target genes in A549 lung epithelial cells (Feng et al. 2014) . This is relevant since transgenic mice expressing a constitutively active form of TGFb 1 were shown to develop atrial but not ventricular fibrosis and had increased susceptibility to atrial fibrillation (Nakajima et al. 2000; Verheule et al. 2004) . Upregulation of TGFb 1 is also known to induce myocardial hypertrophy (Parker et al. 1990 ) and is evident in animal models of heart failure (Dobaczewski et al. 2011 ). However, therapies which block TGFb would be expected to have adverse effects due to the pleiotropic nature of TGFb signaling (Dobaczewski et al. 2011) . In future studies, it will be important to determine if ZFP451 expression in the pulmonary myocardium and heart of atrial fibrillation patients is altered in parallel with increased TGFb expression; if so, this transcription factor might be a viable therapeutic target.

A likely candidate underlying the Chr2: 77.5 6 1 Mb eQTL is the Ttn gene, encoding TTN, a giant muscle structural protein which acts as a myofibrillar backbone attached to the Z-disk, the thin filament, the thick filament, and the M-band (Linke 2008) . TTN regulates the passive stretch of cardiomyocytes via the I-band region of the protein which is comprised of sequential Ig, PEVK, and N2B domains (Linke 2008) . In the heart, alternative splicing of Ttn results in a shorter ventricular isoform (N2B) and a longer atrial isoform (N2BA) . These two isoforms are coexpressed at different ratios during development as a mechanism for fine-tuning the passive stiffness of the cardiomyocyte . TTN acts as a signaling hub from which direct and indirect interactions with multiple proteins can lead to diverse cellular responses, including changes in gene expression (Linke 2008) .

The pulmonary myocardium gene coexpression network (Table S3 in File S2) contains a number of genes coding for TTN-interacting proteins, including cardiac myosin-binding protein C (Mybpc3; one of the original 24 transcripts), a-actinin (Actn2), obscurin (Obscn), Actc1, cardiac ankyrin protein [Ankrd1; also known as cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (CARP)], myomesin (Myom2), and four and a half LIM domains 2 (Fhl2). Of these TTN-interacting proteins, FHL2 interacts with the N2B domain (present in both isoforms), while CARP interacts with the N2A domain (present only in the longer N2BA isoform) (Linke 2008) . Both FHL2 and CARP have been shown to act as transcription factors in response to specific stimuli. For example, CARP is upregulated at the myofibril and in the nucleus in response to stretch (Miller et al. 2003) , while FHL2 is upregulated in response to RhoA signaling (Philippar et al. 2004 ). FHL2 has also been shown to interact with SRF to antagonize expression of smooth muscle genes in differentiating embryonic stem cells (Philippar et al. 2004) . Similarly, CARP overexpression in murine neonatal cardiomyocytes represses expression of Anf, Actc1, Acta1, bMHC, ventricular myosin light chain 2 (Myl2), and cardiac troponin C (Tnnc) (Mikhailov and Torrado Figure 5 A model for pulmonary myocardium gene regulation in response to hemodynamic stress. Based on our gene network analysis we propose that hemodynamic changes trigger mechanosensory (stretch-stress) signaling from the sarcomere via TTN, and initiate NO signaling cascades which are transmitted to the myocyte nucleus via NOSTRIN. These signals initiate dynamic regulation of gene expression to enable finetuning of the contractile properties of the pulmonary myocardium. Gene expression changes may also be regulated at the post-transcriptional level by RBM20 which could feedback to regulate Nostrin, Ttn, and Zfp451. Collectively, these effects are predicted to result in altered contractile properties, ion handling, and hormonal signaling in the pulmonary myocardium to direct an effective response to the initial hemodynamic cue. 2008); genes which are associated with our pulmonary myocardium gene network. We therefore propose a model whereby mechanosensing by TTN could lead to altered gene expression of the pulmonary myocardium gene network via FHL2 or CARP ( Figure 5 ), which might exert opposing transcriptional effects depending on the TTN isoform expressed (as CARP signaling would only be activated by the N2BA isoform). Interestingly, Fhl2 had one of the highest fold-changes in expression in the left atria of patients with atrial fibrillation compared to healthy controls (Deshmukh et al. 2015) , supporting a role for dysregulated TTN signaling in the pathobiology of atrial fibrillation.

Our eQTL analysis indicates that one of the genes potentially regulated by TTN is Rbm20, which in turn regulates Ttn isoform expression. RBM20 mediates alternative splicing of Ttn, resulting in increased expression of the shorter N2B isoform (increased stiffness) at the expense of the longer N2BA isoform (Beraldi et al. 2014; Guo et al. 2013; Wyles et al. 2016) . RBM20 is also involved in alternative splicing of Mef2a, Znf451, and Trdn (Beraldi et al. 2014; Guo et al. 2013) , and is associated with altered expression of Nkx2-5, Myl4, Myl7, Tnnt2, Mybpc3, and Actc1 (Beraldi et al. 2014) . These changes in gene expression could be due to alternative splicing of MEF2A, which is likely to regulate the pulmonary myocardium gene network (Table 4 ). In knockout/-down studies, loss of RBM20 is associated with altered splicing and expression levels of .200 genes, and the authors conclude that RBM20 underpins structural and functional development of cardiomyocytes (Beraldi et al. 2014) . RBM20 is also likely to be an important regulator of the pulmonary myocardium molecular phenotype, is associated with NKX2-5 expression, and could be an important therapeutic target in atrial fibrillation.

As a whole, our data imply that regulatory polymorphisms which alter expression levels of upstream regulators of this gene network (such as Nkx2-5, Mef2a, SRF, Nostrin, Znf451, and Ttn) might predispose to atrial fibrillation. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that expression of Ttn, one of our candidate upstream regulators, is increased in atrial fibrillation patients with persistent disease (Deshmukh et al. 2015 ) and a recent GWAS that has for the first time identified the TTN locus as a susceptibility locus for atrial fibrillation in humans (Christophersen et al. 2017) . Further, genes within our gene network that are regulated by the Chr2 eQTL containing Ttn are also dysregulated in atrial fibrillation (Rbm20, Atp2a2, Fndc5, and Mybphl) (Deshmukh et al. 2015) and dysregulation of transcription factors and ion/calcium handling genes could drive the switch from working myocardium to the pacemaker phenotype observed in the pulmonary myocardium in atrial fibrillation.

Of particular interest in our gene network is the expression of Cacna2d2 which codes for the a-2/d subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel complex, a subunit that is highly and predominantly expressed in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes (Marionneau et al. 2005) . This gene is expressed at low levels in our gene network but is regulated from a suggestive eQTL on Chr1: 33 (one of the three loci from which our gene network is coregulated). Since expression of this subunit is associated with nodal tissues, upregulation of Cacna2d2, subsequent to dysregulation of our gene network, could predispose to gain of pacemaker activity. In support of this, Cacna2d2 expression is reported to be highly sensitive to dosage of the transcription factor TBX5 (Mori et al. 2006) , another gene in our extended gene network. TBX5 is an essential factor for development of the cardiac conduction system including the atrioventricular bundle and bundle branches (Arnolds et al. 2012; Mori et al. 2006; Moskowitz et al. 2004 ). TBX5 has also been shown to interact and cooperate with both NKX2-5 (Hiroi et al. 2001; Puskaric et al. 2010 ) and GATA4 (Munshi et al. 2009 ) (also in our gene network) to drive commitment to a nodal cell phenotype (Stefanovic et al. 2014 ). Since NKX2-5 is known to suppress the nodal phenotype (Ye et al. 2015) , a fine balance between TBX5 interactions with NKX2-5 vs. GATA4 may underlie the maintenance of the working myocardium in the pulmonary myocardium.

Taken together, a model is proposed whereby hemodynamic stress triggers mechanosensory (stretch-stress) signaling from the sarcomere and initiates NO signaling cascades from the adjacent pulmonary epithelia, which are transmitted back to the pulmonary myocardium myocyte nuclei ( Figure 5 ). This leads to dynamic regulation of gene expression, enabling fine-tuning of the contractile properties of the pulmonary myocardium, such as the rate and force of contraction, as well as influencing blood volume, ion transport, and hormone signaling. Our findings indicate that genetic variability at these loci can modify levels of gene expression in the pulmonary myocardium, and could modify venous return to the left atrium as well as pathological features such as hypertrophy, fibrosis, and initiation of ectopic beats. Hence the genes/loci identified in this study could be linked to atrial fibrillation in humans triggered by pulmonary events. Indeed, these loci regulate genes that in humans are known to be associated with various heart diseases (dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmia) and are therefore viable candidates for involvement in the pathobiology of atrial fibrillation. 

T he first case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Republic of Korea was confirmed in May 2015 after a traveller returned from the Middle East. 1 There were 186 cases, including 38 deaths, within two months. 1 The potential of a single MERS-confirmed patient to result in such a large MERS outbreak constitutes a serious global health concern. 2 During this MERS outbreak, massive public health containment measures were enacted at various levels; these included epidemiological investigations, isolation of suspected and confirmed cases, contact tracing and home quarantine of contacts. Local public health centre (LPHC) and emergency medical services (EMS) personnel responded to the outbreak by conducting initial interviews with suspected cases, transporting patients and specimens and managing contacts. Responders in contact with patients used different levels of personal protective equipment (PPE). Full-protection PPE includes a gown, N95 respirator, gloves and goggles. As the transmissibility of MERS is unclear, 3 it is possible that responders were infected by being exposed to MERS patients.

We conducted a cross-sectional study in January 2016 to assess whether LPHC and EMS workers were infected and to determine their degree of exposure. The participants had contact with MERS-confirmed patients or their specimens during the outbreak and volunteered to participate in this study. The survey, which was a face-to-face interview, examined subjects' general characteristics, professional responsibilities, contact history, symptoms after exposure and use of PPE.

Contact was defined as meeting at least one of the following four criteria: 4 being within 2m of a confirmed patient, staying in the same space as a confirmed patient for over 5 minutes, contact with a patient's respiratory or digestive secretions and contact with specimens from confirmed patients before the sample was packaged. Contact within the same space was graded into four levels according to distance of contact and wearing of PPE. Without full PPE protection: Grade 1 was defined as contact within 2m, and Grade 2 was defined as contact at over 2m. With full PPE protection: Grade 3 was defined as contact within 2m, and Grade 4 was defined as contact at over 2m.

Serum collected from all participants was screened for the presence of MERS-CoV IgG using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). One sample with borderline results and five samples with negative ELISA results were retested using indirect immunofluorescence The PRNT was performed as previously described. 5 The number of plaques per well were counted; reductions in plaque counts of 50% (PRNT50) and 90% (PRNT90) were calculated using the Spearman-Kärber formula. 5

Thirty-four workers participated in the study ( Table 1) : 31 from 11 LPHCs and three from two EMS units. Twenty (58.8%) responders were male; their mean age was 44 (34-56.7) years. Twenty-five participants (73.5%) occupied health-related positions: 11 (32.4%) general health-care staff, 6 (17.6%) nurses, 4 (11.8%) doctors, 3 (8.8%) paramedics and 1 medical laboratory technologist (2.6%). Nine participants (26.5%) were non-health-related workers: 5 (14.7%) technicians, 2 (5.9%) administrators, 1 (2.9%) agricultural worker and 1 (2.9%) unknown.

Based on the highest risk contact for each participant, seven (20.6%) of the responders were classified as Grade 1; they were partially protected with at least gloves and an N95 respirator ( Table 1 ). They contacted asymptomatic or symptomatic patients, and symptomatic patients wore surgical masks. After MERS-CoV had been confirmed in a patient, all staff were fully protected when in contact with the patient. The closest contact occurred when touching and holding patients during transport. One responder wearing full PPE had a mild fever (37.5 °C) after contact with a symptomatic patient who was later confirmed as infected. Since the response system had not expanded in the early days of the outbreak, she was not tested but was isolated with self-monitoring.

Serum samples were obtained from all 34 participants at an average of 7.3 months (range: 6.7-8.1 months) after exposure. On ELISA, there were 33 (97.1%) negative results and one borderline result. The results of six samples, including one with borderline ELISA results, were negative in the IIFT and PRNT.

In our study, we could not find evidence of MERS infection in the public health providers after direct contact with confirmed patients. This may be because there was a lower risk of transmission when participants optimal use of PPE to prevent MERS infection. 8 Moreover, since the participants did not contact any spreaders except one participant who contacted a patient that caused two secondary infections, the risk of transmission from the contacted patients was likely low.

This study had several limitations. First, the survey was conducted 7.3 months after the MERS outbreak, making recall bias possible. Second, it is possible that we missed some mild or asymptomatic cases. Furthermore, because the serological tests were performed several months post-exposure, pre-existing MERS antibodies may have decreased or disappeared in the interval, potentially leading to underestimation. While asymptomatic MERS infection had been detected using RT-PCR testing at the time of outbreak, 9 a Saudi Arabian study showed the longevity of MERS-CoV antibodies in MERS patients varied in the severity of illness. For example, antibodies in severely infected patients persisted after 18 months, but milder and subclinical cases detected no antibodies even early on in the disease. 10 Third, the number of participants was relatively small and may not be representative or generalizable. Despite these limitations, this study suggests that the risk of MERS transmission to public health professionals responding to MERS outside the hospital setting (i.e. patients' homes) was low, particularly for those who wore some level of PPE such as masks and gloves. Further study is needed to prospectively survey public health responders including symptomatic or asymptomatic cases to conduct genetic test and serologic test during an outbreak.

In conclusion, the public health providers in our study did not have evidence of MERS transmission after direct contact with confirmed patients when PPE was used properly.

Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the institutional review board of Seoul National University Hospital in Seoul (IRB No. C-1512-049-727).

Astrovirus VA1 identified by next-generation sequencing in a nasopharyngeal specimen of a febrile Tanzanian child with acute respiratory disease of unknown etiology

Over the past decade, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become a useful tool to identify novel or emerging infectious agents. 1 Although NGS is not yet used as a routine diagnostic tool, it is increasingly used as a second line of investigation for select clinical cases, particularly when routine molecular and serological assays fail to identify a causative pathogen. We developed a NGS-based pipeline (ezVIR) to process NGS data for the identification of viruses in humans 2 with the aim of identifying divergent or unexpected viruses in biological specimens of subjects with unexplained clinical syndromes. 2, 3 We used ezVIR to analyze 30 nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected in a previous study that examined the causes of fever in Tanzanian children 4 who were suffering from respiratory symptoms of any type but for whom an infectious agent was not detected (except colonizing bacteria in the nasopharynx) despite extensive investigations, including viral, bacterial and parasitic molecular and serological assays. 4 The specimens were pooled in groups of five and assessed according to the specific RNA and DNA library preparation protocols as previously described 2 for NGS analysis (paired-end sequencing using the 100-bp protocol with indexing on a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Unexpectedly, an astrovirus VA1 was identified in pool 1 (Figure 1 ; Supplementary  Table S1 ).

Each specimen in pool 1 (patients T32, T794, T359, T560 and T524) was analyzed individually using the astrovirus VA1-specific real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the capsid region (forward primer 5′-CCA TCA GCA GTT ACY GGG TCT GT-3′; reverse primer 5′-CGT GGC TCC AGG TGA YTG T-3′; probe 5′-FAM-TTT CCG CAT ATC CC-MGB_NFQ-3′) under the following cycling conditions: 50°C for 30 min; 95°C for 15 min; 45 cycles of 15 s at 94°C and 1 min at 55°C. Patient T359 was confirmed positive for astrovirus VA1 (Ct value = 29.6; Figure 1 ). The initial T359 nasopharyngeal specimen was reanalyzed individually by NGS. NGS data were analyzed with ezVIR and completed by performing a de novo analysis. As shown in the ezVIR phase 2 report, 91.5% coverage of the astrovirus VA1 genome was obtained (305 mapped reads), with a maximum coverage depth of 11-fold. Phylogenetic analysis of the capsid fragment consensus sequence (1077 nucleotides long) obtained from de novo assembly 5 shows the closest nucleotide homology (97.8%; Figure 1 ) with the novel human astrovirus (HAstV) VA1/HMO-C-UK1 sequence (KM358468, corresponding to nucleotides 5137 − 6213). The presence of a parainfluenza virus type 4 (PIV-4) was also detected in the ezVIR phase 2 report, with lower signals for both parameters (174 mapped reads, 38.5% genome coverage, maximum coverage depth of sevenfold). However, using the FTD Respiratory pathogens 21 commercial assay (Fast-track Diagnostics, Sliema, Malta), the PIV-4 genome was not detected in the specimen, suggesting a viral load below the limit of detection of this assay (the limit of positivity was Ct values ⩽ 37). By contrast, in agreement with the ezVIR phase 2 report for pool 1 (Figure 1) , patients T32 and T794 were confirmed positive for PIV-2 (Ct value = 21.6) and PIV-4 (Ct value = 31), respectively, by specific real-time RT-PCR. This finding suggests that the PIV-4-negative result in patient T359 reflects a very low viral load rather than potential mismatches between the assay target and the viral genome sequences of some PIV-4 circulating in this specific area during the study. For this reason, PIV-4 is considered unlikely to be responsible for the respiratory symptoms in this patient. Furthermore, an intrinsic consequence of highly sensitive NGS technology is the increased detection of interspecimen contamination. Therefore, the presence of several thousands of PIV-4 mapped reads in pool 1 and pools 4, 5 and 6 allows the possibility of potential contamination from neighboring PIV-4-positive samples.

Patient T359 was a 13-month-old girl brought to the Amana District Hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in June 2008 for fever (39.3°C), runny nose and cough for the past three days. She had no other symptoms, in particular no diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting or rash. Except for the elevated temperature, the patient's vital signs were normal (the respiratory rate was 35 breaths/min), there was no sign of severe sepsis or respiratory distress, and the detailed physical examination did not reveal any abnormality. The caregivers responded negatively to questions about the presence of acute disease in contact persons or chronic disease in the child. The leukocyte count (leukocytes 33 × 10 9 /L with a neutrophilic predominance), C-reactive protein (139.1 mg/mL) and procalcitonin levels (5.772 µg/L) were elevated. Other blood tests were within the normal range (hemoglobin 9.7 g/dL, alanine transaminase 43 U/L, hematocrit 29.1% and platelets 453 × 10 9 /L). The urine dipstick was positive for leukocytes, and thus the patient was treated with cotrimoxazole, but the urine culture was sterile. As mentioned, no viral, bacterial or parasitic agent was evidenced after a broad range of investigations, including blood culture. In particular, virological screening included the following specific real-time RT-PCR assays: influenza A and B; respiratory syncytial virus; metapneumovirus; PIV types 1 and 3; rhinovirus; enterovirus; coronavirus (HKU1, NL63, 229E and OC43); bocavirus; adenovirus; human herpesvirus 6; parvovirus B19; dengue; chikungunya; West Nile and Rift Valley viruses. She was also screened for antigen detection of adenovirus and rotavirus, and serological assays targeting IgM for Epstein − Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis A and E, mumps and measles were performed. The clinical diagnosis retained was a tracheobronchitis of unknown etiology.

Astrovirus VA1 belongs to the novel Mamastrovirus 9 species (Astroviridae family) and was first identified in 2009 in human stools during an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis. [6] [7] [8] Its prevalence in stools ranges from 0.2% to 1.6% in diarrheic and non-diarrheic subjects worldwide. [8] [9] [10] Furthermore, astrovirus VA1 has been identified in brain biopsies of immunocompromised patients with central nervous system disease, 9, [11] [12] [13] but it has never been documented in respiratory specimens until now. Current molecular diagnostic assays used in most routine laboratories target only the classical HAstV 1-8 serotypes, which belong to the Mamastrovirus 1 species; yet, astrovirus VA1 cannot be diagnosed because it shares only a 46% nucleotide sequence identity with the full genome of HAstV-1. This is particularly unfortunate, as a recent investigation of healthy adult blood donors in the United States showed that 65% of the samples were seropositive. 14 In terms of public health relevance, there is increasing evidence that astrovirus VA1 and other novel HAstVs recently described worldwide (i.e., astrovirus VA1-5 and MLB1-3 15 ) may be of importance in routine diagnostics, particularly in immunocompromised patients. To our knowledge, our finding is the first documented case of an astrovirus VA1 in the respiratory tract, and it justifies considering the potential association of recently identified new human astroviruses, such as astrovirus VA1, with 

Background: Young children with persistent wheezing pose a diagnostic and therapeutical challenge to the pediatrician. We aimed to evaluate bacterial bronchial infection as a possible reason for non response to conventional asthma therapy, and to identify and characterise the predominant pathogens involved.

Methods: We retrospectively analysed microbiological and cytological findings in a selected population of young wheezers with symptoms unresponsive to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy, who underwent flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Procedural measures were taken to limit contamination risk and quantitative bacterial culture of BAL fluid (significance cut-off ≥ 10 4 colony-forming units/ml) was used. Modern microbiological methods were used for detection of a wide panel of pathogens and for characterisation of the bacterial isolates.

Results: 33 children aged between 4 and 38 months, without structural anomalies of the conductive airways were evaluated. Significant bacterial BAL cultures were found in 48,5 % of patients. Haemophilus influenzae was isolated in 30,3 %, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 12,1 % and Moraxella catarrhalis in 12,1 %. All H. influenzae isolates were non-encapsulated strains and definitely distinguished from non-haemolytic H. haemolyticus. Respiratory viruses were detected in 21,9 % of cases with mixed bacterial-viral infection in 12,1 %. Cytology revealed a marked neutrophilic inflammation.

Conclusions: Bacterial infection of the bronchial tree is common in persistent preschool wheezers and provides a possible explanation for non response to ICS therapy. Non-typeable H. influenzae seems to be the predominant pathogen involved, followed by S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis.

Recurrent and/or persistent wheezing in young children is a major reason for use of pediatric healthcare resources [1, 2] . Despite the high morbidity of persistent infantile wheezing, there are only few comprehensive studies in this domain, resulting in poor knowledge of the pathophysiology and a lack of efficacy data of therapeutical interventions [3] . Although 3 pediatric asthma phenotypes have been described, in daily practice preschool wheezers remain a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the pediatrician [4, 5] .

Current asthma guidelines, recommend a trial with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in these children, based on the established pathophysiology of eosinophilic inflammation and the proven efficacy in asthma in adults [2, 6, 7] .

From clinical experience and scientific reports, it is apparent that preschool wheezers are a heterogeneous group of which only part will benefit from the use of ICS [8] [9] [10] . Several authors recommend an extensive work-up in ICS non-responders, including gastrooesophageal reflux and allergy testing, sweat chloride test and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (FOB + BAL) to evaluate for underlying structural anomalies, comorbidities, underlying genetic disorders and an infectious etiology [2, 5, 6, 9, 10] .

In this report, we describe the findings of FOB + BAL, in a selected group of young persistent wheezers without underlying structural anomalies. We focus on the microbiological findings and discuss the possible pathophysiology of bronchial bacterial infection.

Children with physician diagnosed, persistent wheezing unresponsive to ICS therapy, who underwent FOB + BAL between January 2005 and December 2007 were included. As a tertiary referral centre, we are referred children for further evaluation and treatment of persistent wheezing despite ICS treatment and anti-reflux therapy in those with demonstrated GERD. Our initial assessment includes a detailed history of disease, symptoms, signs and treatment adherence, a check for the appropriateness of treatment administration and dosage, and a thorough physical examination. In children without any apparent explanation for persistent wheezing, a work-up, including FOB + BAL is conducted. In these cases, FOB + BAL is always performed under stable condition, outside episodes of acute infection or exacerbation of respiratory symptoms.

Children with symptoms other than wheezing, such as chronic wet cough, recurrent bronchitis and stridor, being the main reason for FOB + BAL were excluded. Children with respiratory tract anomalies including malacia of the conductive airways, or with known underlying chronic conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, immune deficiency, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital heart diseases and neuromuscular disorders were also excluded.

When available, results of allergy and reflux testing, data on anti-reflux therapy prior to FOB + BAL, familial history of allergy and asthma, a history of exposure to tobacco smoke, and the response to antibiotic treatment were recorded. Children with positive skin prick tests and/or elevated specific immunoglobulin E in blood were considered allergic. GERD was assessed by a positive 24 hour-oesophageal pH measurement, interpreted according to gastroenterological criteria [11] .

Flexible fibroscopic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage:

FOB and BAL-sampling were performed according to European Respiratory Society recommendations, as previously described [12, 13] . BAL-samples were divided into 2 aliquots, which were immediately sent to the Microbiology lab and the Hematology lab.

Upon arrival in the lab, BAL-samples were processed for smear, bacterial culture, viral culture, and for the detection of influenzavirus A and B; parainfluenzavirus types 1, 2, 3; RSV; human metapneumovirus subtypes A and B; coronaviruses 229E and OC43, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae using an in-house multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (mPCR)-protocol, as described previously [13] . The performance of this test was assessed by regular participation in the external quality programme organised by QCMD (West of Scotland Science Park Glasgow G20 0XA Scotland, UK).

Gram staining of smear and bacterial BAL-culture were performed according to standard methods [14, 15] . 70 μL of BAL-fluid was centrifugated on a cytospin slide and Gram stained. Samples were considered representative of the lower airways, if >40 % of instilled volume was recovered and if < 1 % of nucleated cells are squamous epithelial cells on smear. Undiluted and 1 μL of a 1/1000 dilution of BAL-fluid were inoculated on blood agar supplemented with X and V factors incubated at 35°C in 5 % CO 2 , MacConkey agar and mannitol salt agar incubated at 35°C in air. Growth was assessed after 24 h, and after 48 h in case of no growth at 24 h. Results were reported in semi-quantitative terms, with a growth of potential pathogens of ≥10 4 cfu/ml considered significant.

All H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae isolates were sent to the respective Belgian reference lab for capsular typing as described elsewhere [13] .

All NTHi isolates were discriminated from nonhaemolytic Haemophilus haemolyticus (non-haemolytic H. haemolyticus) using molecular techniques [13] .

Cytology BAL-fluid was transported to the laboratory in a siliconized container on ice. The fluid was filtered through nylon gauze. After staining with brilliant cresyl blue, total nuclear cell counts were performed in a Bürker counting chamber under light microscopy at a magnification of 250x. A cell suspension of 2.10 6 cells/ μl was made in phosphate-buffered saline with 1 % bovine serum albumin (PBS-BSA). Cytocentrifuge preparations were made and stained by May-Grünwald Giemsa. Two hundred cells were examined for differential cell counts.

Given that the median percentage of neutrophils in BAL-fluid of healthy children is 0.9-3.5 %, we chose to base our definition for neutrophilic inflammation in BAL-fluid on presence of >10 % neutrophils in the cytological differentiation, as previously done by Saito et al. [10, 12] .

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS IBM Statistics version 19 software. Mann-Withney Test was used for equality of medians, with a 2-tailed p-value < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Multiple comparisons were handled by the Holm's method.

In all cases FOB + BAL was medically indicated. Full parental consent was obtained orally after explanation of the procedure, its benefits and its risks.

Retrospective chart analysis was approved by the ethical committee of the Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel (UZ Brussel).

Thirty-three children, 12 girls and 21 boys with a median age of 10 months (range 4-38 m), were assessed because of unexplained persistent wheezing despite ICS therapy. Administrated ICS dosages ranged from 100-500 mcg fluticasone daily or equivalent, with a variable treatment duration of 1-10 months. Table 1 summarises the characteristics of the study population with respect to allergy and reflux testing results, and familial and environmental risk factors for asthma. Only 7 of 13 (53.8 %) children suffering from gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), were treated for GERD prior to FOB + BAL.

None of the children were treated with antibiotics in the 7 days prior to FOB + BAL.

The FOB + BAL procedure was well tolerated in all children.

Significant bacterial cultures were found in 16 of 33 (48.5 %) children (Table 2) . No significant differences in the number of positive BAL-cultures were seen in children with or without GERD.

Aerobic bacteria were isolated as sole pathogen in 11 of 33 (33.3 %) cases. Mixed bacterial-viral infection and mixed bacterial-atypical infection were found in 4 of 33 (12.1 %) and in 1 of 33 (3.0 %) cases, respectively ( Table 2) .

Considering only significant bacterial BAL-cultures, Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae), isolated from 10 of 33 (30.3 %) children, was the predominant bacteria found, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) and Moraxella catarrhalis (M. catarrhalis) ( Table 2 ). Bacterial co-infection was found in 5 of 33 (15.2 %) cases, including H. influenzae in 4 of these; twice with S. pneumoniae, once with M. catarrhalis and once with both S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis, and 1 co-infection with Staphylococcus aureus and Serratia marcescens ( Table 2) .

Respiratory viruses were detected in 7 of 32 (21.9 %) cases, with predominance of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) ( Table 2 ). In 3 of 32 (9.4 %) cases the respiratory virus was the sole pathogen detected ( Table 2) . Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected in 1 of 19 cases, in a mixed infection with H. influenzae (Table 2) .

Capsular typing of H. influenzae isolates revealed that all 10 isolates were non-encapsulated strains (NTHi). All 10 NTHi strains were evaluated for misidentification of non-haemolytic H. haemolyticus, and all were proven true NTHi. Nine of ten (90 %) NTHI isolates were β-lactamase negative and susceptible to ampicillin (MIC ≤ 1μg/ml) and cefuroxime (MIC ≤ 1μg/ml) [16] . The latter isolate was β-lactamase positive, with a MIC = 2μg/ml for amoxicillin-clavulanate and MIC = 3μg/ml for cefuroxime. The 4 S. pneumoniae isolates were fully susceptible to penicillin and belonged to serogroups; ST 6, ST 9, ST 11 and ST 19.

Susceptibility based antibiotic treatment in patients with a significant BAL-culture is routine in our centre. In general, antibiotics are administered orally for 10 days (daily dose: 50-75 mg/kg for amoxicillin or amoxicillinclavulanate). 7 Of 16 (43,8 %) patients responded well to treatment, in 3 of 16 (18,8 %) no change in symptoms was noted, and data were missing for 6 patients. In 4 of 7 (57,1 %) responders however, symptoms relapsed within 2-3 weeks after completion of the antibiotic treatment. In one of these patients, FOB + BAL was repeated 70 days after the initial procedure. NTHi (>10 5 colony forming units (cfu)/ml) that was present as sole pathogen in the first BAL fluid was cultured again together with S. pneumoniae (>10 5 cfu/ml).

The Total cell count (TCC) in BAL-fluid was high (median: 1055.5/mm 3 , IQR: 544.5/mm 3 -2099.75/mm 3 ) and differential cytology revealed a neutrophilic inflammation in 24 of 28 (85.7 %) patients.

Patients with a positive bacterial BAL-culture, had a significantly higher TTC (median 1893.5/mm 3 , IQR 829.7/mm 3 -3479.5/mm 3 versus 787.0/mm 3 , IQR 283.5/ mm 3 -1439.5/mm 3 ; p = 0.023) compared to patients with a negative BAL-culture. Cytology of BAL-fluid differed significantly between patients with NTHi isolated from BAL and patients with a negative BAL-culture (Table 3 ).

In contrast to viral infections, which are known to be associated with wheezing in young children, bacterial infections have long been considered of no importance in asthma and wheezing, and antibiotic therapy is not recommended in current asthma treatment guidelines [17] [18] [19] [20] . However, several studies suggest that bacteria might play a role in wheezing in young children [9, 10, 17, 19, 20] . Moreover, it is increasingly appreciated that the human body is home to an extended microbiome, with asthmatic children harbouring different bacteria and a less diverse mix compared to healthy children [21] . Characterisation of the predominant bacteria in wheezing children is essential to understand the pathophysiology of persistent wheezing.

Recently, tracheobronchomalacia has been shown to be highly associated with bronchial inflammation and bacterial infection in children with persistent respiratory symptoms [22] . Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether bacterial infection is simply a consequence of impaired mucociliary clearance or whether it is an independent inflammatory stimulus in persistent wheezers.

We hypothesized that bacterial infection might indeed be an independent inflammatory stimulus in persistent preschool wheezers, and chose to study a selected group of patients without structural anomalies of the conductive airways.

In our study, we found that bronchial bacterial infection is common in persistent preschool wheezers without apparent reasons for impaired mucociliary clearance, and that H .influenzae was the predominant aerobic pathogen isolated, followed by S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis. We also found frequent bacterial co-infection involving these 3 pathogens. Our findings corroborate observations of other authors, who also described the predominance of this bacterial triad in children with persistent or recurrent wheezing [9, 10, 19, 20, 23, 24] .

The frequent upper respiratory tract colonisation with these aerobic bacteria in children, may provide difficulties to discriminate between contamination and true bronchial infection [25] . However, we consider our results to reflect true bronchial infection, as we applied procedural methods, which were shown to limit strongly the risk for contamination [13, 20, 26, 27] . In particular, we chose to use a cut-off of ≥10 4 cfu/ml for bacterial BAL-culture, although in adults a cut-off of ≥10 3 cfu/ml has demonstrated to be discriminative [28, 29] . The applied cut-off was also used previously by others, studying children with chronic bronchitis [30] . Moreover, although FOB + BAL were only performed once in the majority of patients, our results probably reflect chronic bronchial infection as all our samples were collected during stable clinical state.

The presence of a significant increased neutrophilic inflammation in BAL-fluid of those patients in which NTHi was cultured, as compared to patients with a negative BAL-culture, supports the hypothesis that bacterial infection is indeed an inflammatory stimulus in children with persistent wheezing [24] .

H. influenzae was the predominant aerobic bacterial pathogen, isolated in 30.3 % of our patients. Although previously other authors have had similar results, isolated strains of H. influenzae were never further characterised [9, 10, 20, 23] . To our knowledge this is the first report that associates bronchial infection with nontypeable H. influenzae (NTHi) in young persistant wheezers. Identification of NTHi as the predominant pathogen further supports our hypothesis that persistent wheezers present an underlying inflammation induced by chronic bacterial infection. Chronic NTHI infection, resulting from the ability of NTHI to persist in the lower airways through several escape mechanisms from the host immune responses, has previously been reported by others [31] [32] [33] . Moreover, in the lower airways of patients with chronic obstructive lung disease, NTHI has been demonstrated to be a major inflammatory stimulus [31, 34] .

The poor response of symptoms to an in-vitro susceptibility guided, adequately dosed antibiotic treatment that we found, is similar to poor response findings in 2 other disease entities involving H. influenzae as a predominant pathogen in children; recurrent and unresponsive otitis media and protracted bacterial bronchitis [35] [36] [37] [38] . In the middle ear, biofilm formation has been demonstrated to be one of the major mechanisms for persistence and provides an explanation for unresponsiveness to antibiotic therapy [39, 40] . Moreover, biofilm formation and intracellular infection are well established mechanisms of NTHi for persistence in the lower airways [31] [32] [33] . Although our study does not provide evidence of biofilm formation in the lower airways of young unresponsive wheezers, our findings of poor response to and frequent relapse after a short course of antibiotic treatment are suggestive for involvement of biofilm. Biofilm formation should be addressed in future studies, because its presence may have consequences for treatment.

The strength of our study is the exhaustive microbiological evaluation with use of semi-quantitative BALcultures, multiplex-PCR (mPCR) for viral and atypical agents, and thorough characterisation of the isolated H. influenzae strains. However, we may have missed some cases of viral infection because human rhinovirus was not included in the applied PCR-protocol.

The major weakness of our study is its retrospective character and the absence of an age-matched control group. However, reports, from prospective conducted studies without profound characterisation of the isolates, describing association between wheezing and bacterial infection support our findings [10, 19, 22] . The absence of a control group is considered a minor weakness, as previous publications have demonstrated the limited risk for contamination of BAL when technical precautions are taken [13, 20, 26, 27] . Moreover, performance of FOB + BAL is considered unethical in healthy children [10, 12] .

Another limitation is the small patient cohort. Due to the multiple exclusion criteria applied, the patients included in the analysis represented only 1,2 % of children seen in our clinic because of persistent respiratory symptoms. Nevertheless, analysis of this highly selected population without structural causes of impaired mucus clearance, enabled us to evaluate the association between bacterial bronchial infection, neutrophilic inflammation and symptoms resistant to ICS therapy.

In preschool children with persistent wheezing unresponsive to adequate inhaled asthma treatment, bacterial infection is frequent, with NTHi, S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis being the main pathogens involved. These microbiological findings and the presence of a pronounced neutrophilic inflammation in BAL-fluid, sampled in patients not presenting an acute exacerbation episode, favours the hypothesis that chronic bacterial infection is an ongoing inflammatory stimulus providing a possible explanation for persistent wheezing despite ICS therapy in these young patients. These elements suggest that the use of antibiotic treatment, although not currently recommended, should be considered in selected young children presenting with chronic wheezing. However, as these patients are indistinguishable without the use of invasive procedures, and biofilm formation and other escape mechanisms may decrease the bactericidal efficacy of antibiotic treatment, additional research is necessary before specific treatment recommendations can be provided. Future research should focus on population characteristics, determination of risk factors for acquisition of bacterial bronchial infection, pathogenicity mechanisms of chronic bronchial infection and possible prevention and treatment strategies.

Comparative phyloinformatics of virus genes at micro and macro levels in a distributed computing environment

Preparedness for a possible global pandemic caused by viruses such as the highly pathogenic influenza A subtype H5N1 has become a global priority. In particular, it is critical to monitor the appearance of any new emerging subtypes. Comparative phyloinformatics can be used to monitor, analyze, and possibly predict the evolution of viruses. However, in order to utilize the full functionality of available analysis packages for largescale phyloinformatics studies, a team of computer scientists, biostatisticians and virologists is needed -a requirement which cannot be fulfilled in many cases. Furthermore, the time complexities of many algorithms involved leads to prohibitive runtimes on sequential computer platforms. This has so far hindered the use of comparative phyloinformatics as a commonly applied tool in this area.

In this paper the graphical-oriented workflow design system called Quascade and its efficient usage for comparative phyloinformatics are presented. In particular, we focus on how this task can be effectively performed in a distributed computing environment. As a proof of concept, the designed workflows are used for the phylogenetic analysis of neuraminidase of H5N1 isolates (micro level) and influenza viruses (macro level). The results of this paper are hence twofold. Firstly, this paper demonstrates the usefulness of a graphical user interface system to design and execute complex distributed workflows for large-scale phyloinformatics studies of virus genes. Secondly, the analysis of neuraminidase on different levels of complexity provides valuable insights of this virus's tendency for geographical based clustering in the phylogenetic tree and also shows the importance of glycan sites in its molecular evolution.

The current study demonstrates the efficiency and utility of workflow systems providing a biologist friendly approach to complex biological dataset analysis using high performance computing. In particular, the utility of the platform Quascade for deploying distributed and parallelized versions of a variety of computationally intensive phylogenetic algorithms has been shown. Secondly, the analysis of the utilized H5N1 neuraminidase datasets at macro and micro levels has clearly indicated a pattern of spatial clustering of the H5N1 viral isolates based on geographical distribution rather than temporal or host range based clustering.

Recent occurrences of pandemics like the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Avian Influenza clearly underscore the threat and seriousness of global diseases. The steadily growing globalization makes it difficult to contain pandemics to a certain region. Therefore, pandemic control is of highest importance to human health. Unfortunately, the segmented nature of the genome of influenza viruses is very conducive for genetic shifts and their rapid spread across various genera augments genetic drift. For example, the human influenza pandemics in 1957 and 1968 were suggested to have been caused by reassorted influenza viruses [1] . Moreover, the H5N1 outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997 has convincingly demonstrated the ability of an avian virus to make the transition from birds to humans directly without going through a perceived "permissible host". In particular, the H5N1 virus is believed to have acquired the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 H5N1 and A/teal/ Hong Kong/W312/97 H6N1, while the internal genes were received from A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 H2N2 or A/teal/Hong Kong/W312/97 H6N1, respectively [2] , [3] . Even though this particular strain was eliminated by culling millions of chicken, its ancestors remains circulating in aquatic birds. This paper proposes a new approach to pandemic control by constantly monitoring molecular evolution at both macro level (within the group of viruses) and micro level (within the group of strains) using comparative phyloinformatics. This can facilitate prediction of how these viruses are evolving in terms of spatial, temporal, and host dimensions, and therefore, allows for faster responses to new outbreaks as well as their diagnosis. However, corresponding phylogenetic tree construction algorithms suffer from long runtimes due to their high degrees of computational complexity as well as the large datasets involved. Therefore, it is necessary to develop informatics based solutions that use suitable algorithms and take advantage of distributed computing technologies to make such studies feasible in a reasonable amount of time. Furthermore, these solutions need to be integrated in a framework for pandemic control that is biologist-friendly. As a result, effective vaccines and antivirals can be designed more easily and within a shorter response time, since specific local strains can be targeted directly.

In this paper it is demonstrated how such a system can be developed using a new distributed workflow design system called Quascade. As a proof of concept, results for an actual systematic phyloinformatics analysis of neuraminidase (NA) genes of H5N1 isolates and influenza viruses are presented. Various phylogenetic algorithms; i.e. UPGMA, Neighbor-Joining, Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Mr. Bayes [4] [5] [6] [7] , are compared with respect to their efficiency and accuracy in deriving biologically meaningful results. In particular, the presented study illustrates how these algorithms can be integrated in a unique user-friendly workflow in order to enhance the efficiency of a comparative phyloinformatic analysis.

The selection of the receptor destroyer NA for this study is motivated by its following properties. NA belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase family of proteins and catalyzes the cleavage of sialic acid residues from viral and cellular glycoproteins. Its most important function is to remove the terminal sialic acids from HA in order to enable the virus budding. Moreover, it helps the virus spreading through the system by additionally removing sialic acids from cell surfaces. In particular, since variations in the NA gene can lead to the evolution of more potent strains, studying the molecular evolution of this gene using the latest algorithms and computing power is essential.

Several isolated studies have been conducted since the H5N1 outbreak in late 2003 to monitor the molecular evolution at gene and genome level [8] , [9] . All these studies involve a phylogenetic analysis at one level or the other. However, no systematic efforts have been undertaken so far to evaluate the suitability of the used phylogenetic algorithms in yielding biologically meaningful results for the analysis of HA and NA gene products of H5N1 viruses in particular and influenza viruses in general.

We have used the new Quascade system to implement distributed workflows for comparative phyloinformatics using different algorithms. Figures 1, 2 , and 3 show these workflows for distance-based algorithms, maximum parsimony algorithms and maximum likelihood algorithms, respectively. The workflows use ClustalW [10] to compute multiple sequence alignments and different phylogenetic algorithms from the PHYLIP package [4] .

The most compute-intensive parts of each workflow (i.e. ProtDist in Figure 1 , ProtPars in Figure 2 , and ProtML in Figure 3 ) are executed in a distributed computing environment by simply multiplexing the data and using several instances of the respective programs. Figures 4 and 5 show execution times of the workflows for varying numbers of processors and sequences. In summary it can be seen that the system can achieve linear speedups.

We have used the designed workflows for the phyloinformatics analysis of NA in different populations of H5N1 in particular and in influenza viruses in general. The reason for choosing a protein-based phyloinformatics approach instead of a gene-based approach is to gain a better understanding of the molecular evolution of the gene product that makes this deadly virus spreading across different hosts. To perform this study, three protein data sets have been collected as follows. 

A medium sized dataset has been obtained comprising 581 entries pertaining to H5N1 NA that were mined from the Uniprot database [11] . 4 . A macro dataset of 909 entries of NA from all Influenza A viruses has been obtained from Uniprot.

These three datasets are shown in the additional files 1, 2, and 3.

Phylograms obtained for the core group from the character based algorithms ProtPars [4] and ProtML [4] are shown in the additional files 4 and 5, while phylograms obtained from the two distance-based algorithms are shown in the additional files 6 and 7. The phylogram obtained by Mr. Bayes [7] is displayed in Figure 6 . P18269Sial, a trypanosoan sialdase and Q05JH9H9N2, a NA of the distantly related H9N2 virus have been used as members of an outlier group for the phyloinformatics analysis.

Our phyloinformatics analysis with the core set has revealed a clear pattern: spatial clustering of the strains based on the particular geographical region rather than temporal clustering based on time scale or according to host range. The obtained trees for the medium-size data set are shown in the additional files 8, 9, and 10. The algorithms ProtPars, NJ, and UPGMA were used. All these algorithms have been distributed using the above Quascade workflows and deployed on a cluster of PCs. The utilized cluster consists of 16 nodes comprising 32 CPUs. Its detailed specification and architecture are shown in Table  1 and Figure 7 , respectively. However, the algorithms ML and Mr. Bayes could not be run on the existing system with the medium dataset since it became apparent that these algorithms require further optimization in terms of distribution and/or more processing resources.

Finally, in order to provide a global perspective of the molecular evolution of H5N1_NA, the dataset of 909 sequences of Influenza A viruses rather than H5N1 alone has been utilized. The objective of this macro level analysis is to signify the fact that this approach may lead to the nearest neighbors of some of the lethal clades which may be kept under observation for further evolution. Again, the large dataset was analyzed using the three algorithms ProtPars, NJ and UPGMA. The results obtained are shown in the additional files 11, 12, and 13. As per the core and medium sized datasets, the macro dataset also conforms Distributed ML Workflow Distance-based Parsimony to the clustering of H5N1_NA along the spatial lines rather than temporal or host range lines.

Keeping the Thai clade isolates in focus while analyzing the large dataset, the results obtained with ProtPars agree with the trend obtained so far. All twelve core sequences are mapped to the Thai clade. Besides these twelve, ten more sequences were found in this clade, whereby eight of them are fragments. The remaining two are actually complete sequences from Thailand (chicken isolates). However, they were annotated as Neuramindase instead of Neuraminidase [12], [13] which explains why these two entries are missing in the core set. However, querying of Uniprot with "Influenza virus" and "NA" as query terms has returned these two entries which are clearly captured and validated in our phyloinformatics analysis. Zooming out of the Thai clade has shown the Vietnam clade as its nearest neighbor, followed further by the Indian clade with Vietnam strains as their neighbors. On the next higher level Indonesian, Malaysian and Chinese clades are indicated as neighbors. It would be interesting to further study the Indian clade and verify how closely the Indian strains and Vietnamese strains are related with respect to other genes and also at genome level. Such an analysis may lead to the identification of the origin for Bird Flu in India. Further analysis of the large dataset indicates H9N2 as the nearest clade to H5N1 and non-structural protein as nearest to NA within the H5N1_NA group. The overall tree includes isolates from H3N2 to H15N9. A detailed analysis of each clade and sub-clade within this tree and with reference to the other two trees could lead to an understanding of H5N1's molecular evolution at global level.

The core set includes samples isolated over a time frame from 1959 to 2006 and represents globally distributed localities from Thailand to Bavaria, Germany. All the phylograms have essentially yielded geographic based clustering rather than time based clustering. The seven distinct clades that were clearly demarcated are: Thailand clade I (Q2L700; Q2LDC8; Q2LDC0; Q6PUP7; Q307U7; Q45ZM8), Thailand clade II (Q5SDA6; Q307V5; Q6PUP6; Q5MD56), Thailand clade III (Q6B518; Q4PKD4), Indian clade (Q0PEF9; Q0PEG0) Scotland clade (Q0A2H3; Q710U6) Bavarian clade (A1EHP1; Workflow Scalability for large data sets A quick perusal of the results obtained with the three algorithms (ProtPars, NJ and UPGMA) has confirmed the pattern obtained from the core set. The strains of H5N1_NA cluster spatially rather than temporally or according to host. However, there are subtle differences amongst the outputs of the three algorithms with respect to their resolution. The clustering obtained using NJ seems to be better resolved than the other two in terms of branch length and sub-speciation. A detailed analysis of the Thai clade obtained by ProtPars also has revealed that all the sequences from the core set have been represented in this tree as well. The additional isolates are mostly fragments obtained through PCR amplification and uploaded to Uniprot. An interesting aspect of this clade is the finding that the entry Q5EP24 (Chicken isolate from Vietnam) is placed almost as an outlier in this group. It would be interesting to analyze the genealogies of Vietnam and Thailand clades and to verify whether there are any "bridging" isolates such as Q5EP24 that may play an important role in the spread of this deadly disease across the globe. We have analyzed our medium dataset to confirm the pattern we obtained with the core set. A detailed analysis of each geographic clade with respect to the "bridging" isolates such as Q5EP24 may reveal a global pattern of H5N1 spread.

Global preparedness for H5N1 pandemic has been declared as the top priority of global health agencies such as CDC. In view of the ever escalating threat of the virus mutating to a human lethal form, it has become essential to constantly monitor the molecular evolution of this virus utilizing the latest and best phylogenetic algorithms.

The current study was undertaken with two objectives: One is to demonstrate the utility of a biologist's friendly high performance computing workflow system in analyzing large and complex biological datasets by deploying compute intensive algorithms in their parallelized ver-sion. The second objective is to analyze H5N1_NA data, as a proof of concept, in such a workflow to understand the molecular evolution of this rapidly evolving virus.

We have demonstrated the utility of workflow systems by designing a pipeline that starts with data input by the biologist. Once the relevant data is uploaded into the workflow the remaining steps are all automated. In particular these steps comprise starting with multiple alignments of sequences to the distribution of the output to various algorithms, distributing the relevant outputs to different servers in a distributed environment which is grid compatible, and finally visualizing the output. Such a workflow system saves a significant amount of time and eliminates possible human errors in analyzing critical data.

In any phylogenetic analysis involving pathogenic viruses there are three clear possibilities of clustering behavior: spatial, temporal and host based. Our analysis of H5N1 NA data utilizing different phylogenetic algorithms have indicated a spatial clustering of this virus based on geographical distribution rather than temporal or host. Of course, single gene product analysis is insufficient to arrive at any biologically relevant conclusion and, hence, we propose to do multiple gene and genome level analysis as our future work. However, even for a single gene analysis the computing power required is formidable and we have used this approach as a proof of the concept that high performance computing is a must for any meaningful phyloinformatics study. Even with the limited amount of data, we have been able to find a clear pattern (geographical clustering) and the importance of glycon sites. However, further detailed studies in conjunction with other proteins such as HA, Polymerase etc., and also at gene and genome level, are required to draw firm conclusions. It is also true that interpretation becomes more difficult if the size of the trees becomes very large. In our experience, zooming onto a cluster of interest (e.g. Thailand and China clades) with relative ease and quickness, using the Quascade middleware is an attractive feature of our study. Furthermore, the comparison of different algorithms simultaneously with the same input file is another attractive attribute.

The exponential growth in the size of biological databases has established the need for high performance computing (HPC) in bioinformatics. Typically, an HPC setup operates in a cluster computing environment consisting of multiple computers that communicate over fast switches. For popular database scanning applications such as BLAST and HMMER the benefits of clusters are immediate and linear speedups can be easily achieved. However, the evolving challenges in life sciences cannot be all addressed by off-the-shelf bioinformatics applications. Life scientists need to analyze their data using novel approaches published in recent journals or based on their own hypotheses and assumptions. Quascade-MP2 has been developed to address this need. It is a visual prototyping tool created especially for data-driven, high performance scientific applications.

The complexity involved in using traditional technologies and tools often proves to be over-whelming and counterproductive. Most of these tools require an understanding of programming or scripting languages, such as Perl, Python, Java, and UNIX-scripts. Recent examples of such systems in bioinformatics include Biopipe [15] , BioWBI [16] , Taverna [17] , Wildfire [18] , KDE Biosciences [19] , gRNA [20] , Biowep [21] , and BioWMS [22] . Each deployment is therefore subject to its own code development and testing. Although programming languages offer sophisticated control over the intended procedure, the learning curve and overheads in terms of human resources are difficult to justify. Quascade has been developed with this problem in mind.

Quascade has been designed for research applications characterized by strict high performance requirements. It provides a graphical, drag-and-drop interface to allow users to design and execute ad-hoc workflows. Workflows are constructed by an end-user by inter-connecting functional blocks, called components. A component is a piece of independent and self-contained code performing a given functionality on its input and generates an output. Data paths among components can be specified by drawing lines between/among the output(s) and input(s) of different components, respectively. Thereby, various combinations of these components (such as one output to multiple inputs, multiple outputs to multiple inputs) can be used to create any workflow depicting the flow of both data and logic.

Individual components in a workflow may be designated to run on different computing servers in a cluster by simply specifying a corresponding condition in Quascade. This provides a straightforward approach of constructing workflows that execute in a high-performance environment. In turn, a component running on a given server may use several computing nodes to execute its program, thereby providing a two-tiered mechanism of distributed processing. As an example, Figure 8 shows a physical workflow and its graphical counterpart. The workflow consists of a sample generator component, which generates/collects data, an analyzer component which performs the actual processing, and a sample sink component which 'consumes' the processed data in terms of not forwarding the data further to another component. While the genera-tor and sink components can be connected to external entities, i.e. physical devices, the analyzer component may be a simple single-node program or a complex, parallel multi-node application. 

The user creates a workflow by selecting workflow components from a predefined list of deployed components on the cluster. Each component is configured to run on a particular cluster server or automatically assigned to a server if no explicit configuration is desired. At run-time Quascade performs a remote invocation to the selected servers and creates local instances of the used components. Hence, client-server communication takes place between a Quascade client and one or more instances of MP 2 servers forming the cluster. Complementary, server-server communication takes place between two or more servers or between a server and its compute nodes.

Two different types of communication can be differentiated: explicit and implicit. They distinguish between the workload distribution by a parallel component to multiple compute nodes and the communication between two of more servers exchanging data, respectively. Serverserver communication uses raw sockets to transfer data from one machine to the other. This solution provides a performance benefit over more sophisticated alternatives such as RMI or CORBA, but represents the lowest level of abstraction of the underlying network. As an answer to this trade-off, MP 2 overcomes the limitations of development complexity and inflexibility by providing an abstraction at the component level supported by a fixed number of network level operations. Thus, a developer has a high degree of flexibility regarding the operation of a component as long as the implementation adheres to the I/O scheme provided by the communication layer. Implicit communication refers to the communication that takes place between the output of one component and the input of another component, i.e. the selected data paths among components. The underlying transfer mechanism is provided by the middleware and comprises input buffers in order to enable asynchronous communication.

Input buffers are continuously polled by the corresponding component and processing continued once data is available. An adjustable buffer length according to load expectation helps to prevent overflows.

For example our workflow component for ClustalW shows all the options that the original ClustalW program presents to users. The options are presented in a parameter output panel and translated into command line string for calling the underlying ClustalW program upon execution of the workflow. After the completion of ClustalW, an output file is produced on the local hard disk at a specified location containing the aligned data set. This file name and its location is the input for the next component (e.g. Seqboot). The remaining components, e.g. Seqboot with its underlying PHYLIP operate in the same way.

For instance, Figure 9 shows a screenshot of the implemented sequential workflow for a distance based phylogenetic analysis.

The runtime of this workflow has been profiled on a single server for an input of 42 sequences and N = 100 replica. As can be seen form Figure 10 , the Protdist component clearly dominates the overall execution time and requires parallelization.

The Seqboot component is modified to break up its output file's data into several data sets, which are written to a buffered output port. Distribution of files is then implemented by using a demultiplexer (Demux) component and a result combining module (Concat). More technical details about the file distribution and concatenation as well as other workflow parameters can be found elsewhere [23] . The model, design and implementation used to distribute the distance-based workflow can also be applied to parallelize the parsimony and the ML based workflows. The usage of the model and design developed for the Protdist component has therefore been used for the Protpars and the ProtML components. The corresponding workflows are shown in Figure 1 , 2, and 3. Figure 9 Distance based Quascade workflow. Screenshot of sequential distance based phylogenetic analysis workflow in Quascade.

viruses Bat Research Networks and Viral Surveillance: Gaps and Opportunities in Western Asia

Bat research networks and viral surveillance are assumed to be at odds due to seemingly conflicting research priorities. Yet human threats that contribute to declines in bat populations globally also lead to increased transmission and spread of bat-associated viruses, which may pose a threat to global health and food security. In this review, we discuss the importance of and opportunities for multidisciplinary collaborations between bat research networks and infectious disease experts to tackle shared threats that jeopardize bat conservation as well as human and animal health. Moreover, we assess research effort on bats and bat-associated viruses globally, and demonstrate that Western Asia has limited published research and represents a gap for coordinated bat research. The lack of bat research in Western Asia severely limits our capacity to identify and mitigate region-specific threats to bat populations and detect interactions between bats and incidental hosts that promote virus spillover. We detail a regional initiative to establish the first bat research network in Western Asia (i.e., the Western Asia Bat Research Network, WAB-Net), with the aim of integrating ecological research on bats with virus surveillance to find "win-win" solutions that promote bat conservation and safeguard public and animal health across the region.

Bats are ecologically and taxonomically diverse mammals with over 1300 species distributed globally and serve as a model taxonomic group for ecological and evolutionary research [1] . Yet, population sizes are decreasing (22%) or unknown (57%) for a vast majority of bat species [2] , and there is limited capacity to manage and protect bat populations in much of the world [3, 4] . Bats are increasingly recognized as important reservoirs for zoonotic diseases, and as a result, research effort on bat-associated viruses and other pathogens has grown dramatically in recent years [5, 6] . Bats are reservoir hosts for several notable groups of viruses that pose significant threats to human and livestock health, including filoviruses [7] , paramyxoviruses [8] , and coronaviruses [9] . Given the importance of protecting human health and global economies, disease surveillance has been the focus of a large body of bat research over the past 15 years. While bat conservation and virus surveillance may appear at odds due to conflicting objectives and research priorities [10] [11] [12] [13] , these two endeavors can be complementary and synergistic, especially if properly linked early on through collaborative research networks. Adopting an ecologically-minded One Health approach to proactively identify bat-associated zoonoses and the specific human activities that contribute to increased spillover risk will also contribute to our understanding of the diversity and distribution of bat species in understudied regions. One Health is the concept that the health of humans, animals, and the environment are inextricably linked, and requires multidisciplinary research and collaboration when put into practice [14] . Inclusion of bat experts in initiatives to monitor bat-associated viruses will enhance our ability to derive and communicate meaningful information about potential risks to human and animal health but also inform intervention measures to reduce opportunities for virus spillover in degraded environments.

Zoonotic diseases are caused by infectious pathogens (e.g., virus, bacteria, fungi) that can be naturally transmitted between humans and other vertebrates, including wild and domestic animals. The number of emerging zoonoses and the geographic distribution of previously known zoonotic pathogens have increased in recent decades [15, 16] . More than half of all infectious diseases that affect human populations (60%) result from pathogens that are shared with animals, both wild and domestic, and 75% of emerging zoonotic diseases are attributed to pathogens with origins in wildlife reservoirs [16, 17] . Rapid modification of the environment and human encroachment promotes interactions between humans, domestic animals, and wildlife species, facilitating disease spillover and presenting a challenge to global health and food security in addition to wildlife conservation [18] . These shared drivers of disease emergence and biodiversity loss are increasingly recognized as warranting a coordinated approach to monitor, detect, and mitigate changes in ecological conditions that may result in increased disease risk [19] . The utility of integrated biodiversity monitoring and disease surveillance was recently highlighted by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity as a pathway to strengthen conservation relevance of One Health policies and research agendas [20] .

Bat research networks have increased in number, largely as collaborative efforts to combat regional threats that traverse country boundaries [21] . Yet a number of geographic regions lack coordinated bat research networks, most notably Western Asia [4] , a region of 20 countries extending from Turkey in the west, Georgia in the north, Yemen in the south, and Afghanistan and Pakistan in the east. Furthermore, most bat research networks are not integrated with the zoonotic disease or viral research communities. Given the potential of Western Asia as an emerging zoonotic disease hotspot [22] , and bat-associated zoonoses hotspot in particular [9, 23] , surveillance initiatives focused on bat-associated viruses in Western Asia are warranted. In this review, we discuss the importance of collaboration between bat research networks and virus surveillance initiatives to understand the role of human activities in the transmission and spread of bat-associated viruses. We conduct a literature review to assess research effort on bats and bat-associated viruses around the world, and demonstrate that Western Asia constitutes a research gap, lacking an established bat research network and has limited published research on bats and their associated viruses. Lastly, we outline a new regional initiative to establish the first bat research network in Western Asia (i.e., the Western Asia Bat Research Network, WAB-Net), with the unique aim of taking an integrated approach to untangle host-virus dynamics to find "win-win" solutions that promote bat conservation and safeguard public and animal health across the region.

Several published reviews and books have highlighted the role of bats as reservoirs for emerging viruses, and described factors that may make bats "special" as disease reservoirs [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Bat-associated viruses have contributed to thousands of human deaths and economic losses exceeding billions of dollars [18, 26] , notably Nipah and Hendra paramyxoviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and SARS-like coronaviruses, swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), and Ebola and

Bats provide vital ecological and economic services, most notably pollination of fruit crops, forest regeneration through seed dispersal, suppression of insect pests that damage crops and vector human diseases, and primary suppliers of nutrients (guano) in cave ecosystems [55] . Yet human pressures on bat populations are manifold, with rapid land conversion from urban encroachment and agricultural intensification contributing to rapid declines in bat populations globally [3] . Human pressures are magnified further by overexploitation through unregulated hunting for consumption, inclusion in medicinal remedies (e.g., asthma) [56] , sport [57] , and the souvenir trade [58] . In addition to these relatively widespread threats to bats, regional threats also exist that can lead to indirect killing of bats, or persecution and disturbance of roosting bats. In Western Asia, widespread application of pesticides to control crop pests, including spraying in caves and abandoned buildings occupied by bats [59, 60] , and agricultural intensification, which has led to the establishment of irrigation systems that deplete available water in this largely arid region [60] , have contributed to declines in regional bat populations. A more recent and unique threat to bats in Western Asia is the fraudulent scheme of selling "bat nests" on Facebook and other social media platforms, with sellers claiming the "nests" contain "red mercury" that has healing properties [61] . There are no documented cases of bats building nests [62] , yet the perceived notion that bats create such economically valuable structures has likely led to increased cave disturbance, potentially displacing or indirectly killing roosting bats [61] . This fraud is speculated to have originated in Iran but has quickly grown in popularity in Jordan [63] and Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Iraq [61] .

While bat conservation efforts and emerging disease surveillance have the potential to be contradictory when not well designed, they are actually aligned by shared human threats that lead to both bat extinction and zoonotic disease emergence. For example, hunting of bats for bushmeat, a major threat to Old World fruit bats [56, 64] , is a high risk activity that puts hunters and butchers in direct contact with blood and excreta and increases the risk of viral spillover from bats [65, 66] . Direct persecution of bats and attempts at population eradication (e.g., the recent culling of bats in Mauritius [67, 68] ) may have countereffects by actually increasing viral prevalence in the bat population [69] , and also increasing the opportunities for viral spillover through direct contact with bats during culling [12, 69, 70] . Similarly, the loss of bat habitat through land conversion for agricultural and livestock production and development, the primary threat to bats globally [3, 71] , is a major risk factor for zoonotic disease emergence [22] . Clearing of forested habitats, specifically for agricultural crops (e.g., fruit orchards), leads to the direct destruction of roosting and foraging sites, and therefore displaces bat populations. It also creates a direct interface between frugivorous bats and humans or livestock that can mediate viral species jumps (e.g., Old World fruit bats and Nipah virus in Malaysia and Bangladesh) [72] [73] [74] . Cave disturbance, such as resource extraction (guano or mineral mining), hunting, and ecotourism, is a major threat to bat populations [75] , especially for species less tolerant to human disturbance [76] , but can also lead to increased contact between bats and humans that may facilitate viral spillover. For example, 7 of 13 cases of Marburg virus spillover to humans have been linked to gold mining activities, and other isolated cases have been linked to ecotourism in caves occupied by Rousettus aegyptiacus [77] .

In response to shared conservation issues that threaten bat populations, bat research has expanded from predominantly short-term, independent projects to sustained collaborative networks that provide training in skills that strengthen bat conservation efforts, from taxonomy to ecology and educational outreach to policy formulation [21] . Numerous regional networks of bat research experts have been established around the world [4, 21] (Figure 1 ). There are a number of advantages that coordinated, regional bat research initiatives have over country-specific efforts, specifically the ability to take effective action on shared threats spanning geographical, temporal, and disciplinary scales [21] . Bats are highly mobile, and often have geographic distributions that extend across political boundaries. Without regional collaborations, conservation efforts in one country may be insufficient to counteract the threats towards a species elsewhere in its range [57] . In just the same way, viruses with mobile hosts can be easily spread across borders and require cooperation among a broad array of experts to ensure the reduced risk of spillover and spread [78] . Moreover, bats are long-lived and therefore require long-term studies that can withstand funding shortages and changes in government priorities and policies [21] . Finally, bats are ecologically and taxonomically diverse, and known reservoir hosts for a diverse range of viruses with zoonotic potential [34] . How, then, can zoonotic disease surveillance programs best leverage the expertise of bat ecologists and conservationists to more fully understand the basic ecology of host species? Furthermore, in return, how can bat experts learn from disease experts to understand the role of human threats in altering host-virus dynamics? [21] and network websites.

A regional network approach can enhance both bat conservation and zoonotic disease mitigation efforts. For instance, longitudinal studies of regional bat populations will aid in identifying shared threats to bats and human-mediated factors associated with increased disease emergence risk, both of which will likely change over time. Yet few bat research networks actively incorporate capacity building and hands-on-training in disease surveillance; however, the Red Latinoamericana para la Conservación de los Murciélagos (RELCOM) identifies emerging diseases as a conservation priority [79] and the Southeast Asian Bat Conservation Unit (SEABCRU) provides protocols on personal protective equipment and safety when conducting bat disease surveillance [80] . The Agreement on the Conservation of Populations of European Bats (EUROBATS) is the only regional bat network to convene a multidisciplinary workshop of public health officials, bat experts, and veterinarians to coordinate otherwise disjunct surveillance efforts for European bat lyssaviruses (EBLV) in several European countries [81] . This workshop laid the foundation for the Resolution on Bats and Rabies in Europe and development of standardized protocols for EBLV surveillance programs in all European countries. Taken together, collaboration is required among diverse experts, including bat conservationists, public health officials, and virologists, in order to build impactful One Health research agendas and formulate effective recommendations to mitigate shared regional threats to bat populations and human health.

Focusing on shared threats that lead to both bat population declines and disease emergence will allow for a common research agenda and can serve to bring together bat conservationists and infectious disease experts. While documenting viral diversity and prevalence in reservoir host populations is a critical first step, assessing ecological and environmental factors that may influence host-virus dynamics in bat populations and promote transmission to incidental hosts, such as humans or domestic animals, is vital for developing effective surveillance initiatives.

While documenting viral diversity and prevalence in reservoir host populations is a critical first step, assessing ecological and environmental factors that may influence host-virus dynamics in bat populations and promote transmission to incidental hosts, such as humans or domestic animals, is vital for developing effective surveillance initiatives. Host-virus dynamics are complex, and the emergence and spread of bat-associated viruses requires more than just the presence of a pathogen in a reservoir host but detailed knowledge of a host species' ecology, behavior, reproduction, genetics, and life history traits [18, 82] . Evidence suggests that many bat-associated viruses have a long history of co-evolution with their bat hosts [83] [84] [85] , further highlighting the importance of understanding both phylogenetic factors and environmental contact with other species to fully appreciate factors driving cross-species transmission [34, 86] . Outbreaks of bat-associated viruses are commonly attributed to atypical interactions between bats and other wildlife species, domestic animals, and humans resulting from human-driven land-use change and encroachment. Shared threats to public health and wildlife conservation transcend national borders, and minimizing such threats will require transboundary collaborations among diverse experts. One multidisciplinary consortium, the Bat One Health Research Network (BOHRN), is now addressing these important issues at a global scale by connecting bat experts and public health researchers to identify critical gaps in research [87] .

Monitoring ecological dynamics and interactions among bats and other wild and domestic animals coupled with behavioral and socio-economic studies of humans in shared ecosystems are hallmarks of a One Health approach [14] . Such approaches are necessary to proactively detect and minimize the emergence and impact of zoonotic diseases. To be effective, a One Health research agenda must synergize with individual experts in bat ecology, physiology, behavior, and genetics, as well as linking in with experts across veterinary and human health sciences. One approach to most efficiently leverage this collective expertise and quickly share knowledge across scientific disciplines is to tap into existing scientific networks. The multiple bat research networks of the world ( Figure 1 ) pose a unique resource and opportunity in this regard. However, these networks currently have differing levels of coordination, resources, and active participation, making this approach more difficult in some geographic areas. Creating a combined bat conservation and infectious disease research network de novo would allow for full integration of these two disciplines from the start by supporting efforts to conserve bat populations and their critical roosting and foraging habitats and helping to safeguard human health from bat-associated viruses. Western Asia is the only contiguous block of countries that currently lacks an organized network of bat researchers (Figure 1 ), representing a conservation void in terms of global bat conservation [4] and an opportunity to integrate initiatives to proactively monitor public health through virus surveillance.

Western Asia is a region recognized as a geopolitical entity but not always clearly defined across international agencies (e.g., UNESCO, WHO, OECD, UNIDO, IUCN). To delimit "Western Asia" for the purposes of this review, we include the following 20 countries: Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Georgia, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Israel, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. While Afghanistan and Pakistan are often considered part of "Central" or "South" Asia, we include both in this review as they serve as an important biogeographic gateway linking bats and (potentially) their associated pathogens with Asian countries to the east.

Research on bats in Western Asia is fragmented, both temporally and spatially. Past research efforts have focused largely on cataloging the bat diversity in a single country [88] [89] [90] [91] or adjacent countries in the region (i.e., Arabia [92] and Caucasus [93] ). These initial efforts contributed some of the first information about bat systematics, ecology, behavior, and geographic distributions in Western Asia. However, a recent resurgence in bat research is reshaping our understanding of the distribution of bats in the region, including new country records [94] [95] [96] [97] and updated species' distributions [98] [99] [100] [101] . The growing number of new distributional records, as well as taxonomic revisions [102, 103] and new species discoveries [96, 104] , published within the last decade points to a clear need for continued bat diversity assessments and field research throughout the region.

The conservation status and distribution of nearly 1300 bat species has been assessed by bat experts and are freely available on The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species website [2] . We compiled spatial data from the IUCN and identified 96 bat species from 10 families that are distributed in Western Asia (Table S1 ). Species richness is highly variable in the region ( Figure 2 ), with no bat species reported in Bahrain and up to 43 species reported in Iran (Table S1 ). Bat species diversity hotspots include the Mediterranean coast from Israel extending to Turkey, the Caucasus mountain region that includes Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan, and northeastern Pakistan ( Figure 2 ). Conversely, arid regions have the lowest species richness, including the vast majority of Saudi Arabia, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, and Iraq. While our map provides a good approximation of bat species richness in the region, using IUCN data alone may likely represent an underestimate as many species have not been reassessed since 2008. Several new distributional records have been published in the last decade, which expands the known geographic range for some species. In other cases, estimates of species richness are lower than depicted, e.g., at least one species (i.e., Myotis hajastanicus) has been shown to be a local variant of a widespread species rather than a distinct species [102] .

Emirates; YEM-Yemen. Shapefiles of species' ranges were extracted using the package raster [105] and converted to raster files using package fasterize [106] . Rasterized polygons of species' ranges were cropped to include only Western Asian countries based on ISO 3166 two-letter codes and mapped using packages maptools [107] and viridis [108] . All analyses were conducted in R version 3.4.3 [109] .

Western Asia represents a unique regional mixing pot of bat species from different zoogeographic regions, with a majority of species found in Western Asia also distributed in other regions of the world (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, Southeast Asia). Specifically, the 96 bat species native to Western Asia occupy 8 of the 12 (67%) geographic regions designated by IUCN, with over 90% of all species distributed in more than one region (Table S2) . For example, Pipistrellus tenuis is Emirates; YEM-Yemen. Shapefiles of species' ranges were extracted using the package raster [105] and converted to raster files using package fasterize [106] . Rasterized polygons of species' ranges were cropped to include only Western Asian countries based on ISO 3166 two-letter codes and mapped using packages maptools [107] and viridis [108] . All analyses were conducted in R version 3.4.3 [109] .

Western Asia represents a unique regional mixing pot of bat species from different zoogeographic regions, with a majority of species found in Western Asia also distributed in other regions of the world (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, Southeast Asia). Specifically, the 96 bat species native to Western Asia occupy 8 of the 12 (67%) geographic regions designated by IUCN, with over 90% of all species distributed in more than one region (Table S2) . For example, Pipistrellus tenuis is widely distributed from the Oceania region (oceanic islands in the Pacific Ocean) westwards into Pakistan and Afghanistan, where its range overlaps with a diversity of species from North Africa and Europe (e.g., Tadarida teniotis, Rousettus aegyptiacus, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Eptesicus bottae, and Myotis blythii). Within Western Asia, nearly a quarter of all bat species are widely distributed in more than half of the 20 countries that comprise the region, with Pipistrellus kuhlii recorded in all but two countries (i.e., Bahrain and Qatar) (Table S2) .

There remains much to be explored about the effects of overlapping species distributions on viral sharing in the region. Eidolon helvum, the second largest Old World fruit bat in Africa and potential reservoir host for ebolaviruses and other zoonotic pathogens [110] [111] [112] [113] , is widespread and panmictic across sub-Saharan Africa but occurs in small areas of Yemen and southwestern Saudi Arabia [40, 114, 115] . Other bat species found within the region have been linked with viruses of concern to human health in at least part of their geographic range. Rhinolophus hipposideros, a species whose range extends from the United Kingdom, east to China and south to Ethiopia (covering much of South, Central, and Western Asia) [116] , has been found to harbor SARS-like CoVs. In Slovenia, for example, nearly 40% of fecal samples collected from R. hipposideros tested positive for SARS-like CoVs, in particular the bat-associated SARS isolate Rp3/2004 [117] . There is also evidence that through cross-species viral sharing, R. hipposideros contributed to a recombinant CoV strain thought to have ancestral linkages to HCoV-NL63 [118] , a human-CoV that can account for up to 10% of respiratory infections annually [119] . Given the paucity of research on bat-associated viruses to date and the extensive species overlap from diverse biogeographic regions, Western Asia presents an untapped opportunity to further investigate the factors that determine cross-species viral transmission.

Several countries in Western Asia face a multitude of economic, political, and security challenges that can hinder wildlife research, and likely contribute to a lack of research effort across the region. To highlight the gap in research effort on bats and their associated viruses, including coronaviruses, in Western Asia we conducted a literature review of specific search terms by country in PubMed (see Figures 3, 5 and 6 ). PubMed is a freely available literature database containing nearly 30 million citations dating from 1948 to 2019, and is maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [120] . We extracted the number of publications per country indexed in PubMed using package rentrez [121] based on the following combinations of search terms: (1) ("bat" OR "bats" OR "Chiroptera" [All Fields]), (2) ("bat" OR "bats" OR "Chiroptera" [All Fields]) AND ("virus" OR "viruses" [All Fields]), and (3) ("bat" OR "bats" OR "Chiroptera" [All Fields]) AND ("coronavirus" OR "coronaviruses" [All Fields]) ( Table 1 ). Counts of publications that include specific search terms were mapped using packages rworldmap [122] and viridis [108] in R version 3.4.3 [109] .

Research effort on bats is heavily biased geographically, in particular the United States, countries of Western Europe, China, Japan, India, Australia, and Brazil had the greatest number of published bat-related studies indexed on PubMed (Figure 3 ). Not surprisingly, overall bat research per country was positively correlated with bat species richness (r = 0.45, p < 0.001) (Table S3) , however many areas of central Africa and Southeast Asia with high species richness had a very low overall number of publications on bats. Globally, nearly half of all countries had less than five bat-related publications indexed in PubMed (42%, see Table S4 ). Western Asia, together with much of Africa, had some of the lowest numbers of bat-related publications, with a few exceptions. While half of all Western Asian countries have 10 or fewer publications on bats, a few countries reported relatively high publication counts, specifically Turkey and Israel (110 and 533 publications, respectively).

Research effort on bats by country. The research effort was quantified as the number of publications indexed in PubMed that included the search terms ("bat" OR "bats" OR "Chiroptera") by country. Raw data provided in Table S4 .

Limited research effort has implications for assessing the conservation status of bat species in Western Asia and impedes our ability to identify imperiled species. A majority of bat species distributed in Western Asian countries are considered least concern (77%), and 9% of species lack sufficient information to even assess their conservation status (Figure 4a ). Yet, population trends for most bat species in Western Asia, including those classified as "least concern," are largely unknown or decreasing (Figure 4b) , and additional research is needed to assess and prioritize species for conservation.

As with publications on bats, research effort on bat-associated viruses is heavily skewed towards the United States, a country with a nationwide surveillance program for monitoring and reporting of Figure 3 .

As with publications on bats, research effort on bat-associated viruses is heavily skewed towards the United States, a country with a nationwide surveillance program for monitoring and reporting of rabies virus infections since 1938 [50] , followed by Australia, China, northern and central Europe, Japan, and Brazil ( Figure 5 ). Again, research effort was significantly correlated with bat species richness (r = 0.47, p < 0.001) although with high variance (Table S3 ). While Western Asia contains "hotspot" areas predicted to be high risk for emerging infectious zoonotic diseases [22] , there have been very few publications on bat-associated viruses in Western Asia ( Figure 5 , Table 1 ). Of the 20 countries comprising Western Asia, only two have more publications on bat-associated viruses than the global average of 20 publications/country, specifically Jordan and Saudi Arabia (21 and 29 publications indexed on PubMed, respectively). However, our analysis of published literature is likely a vast overestimation of the amount of true bat-associated virus research occurring in the region. Many publications identified in the keyword searches are review papers or experimental laboratory studies that reference bats as an origin host, or follow up studies from MERS-CoV investigations in other hosts (i.e., dromedary camels). The number of surveillance or discovery studies on bat-associated viruses in Western Asia is scant, with a study on hantaviruses in bats from Georgia [123] being one of the few non-CoV publications from the region. rabies virus infections since 1938 [50] , followed by Australia, China, northern and central Europe, Japan, and Brazil ( Figure 5 ).

Recent outbreaks of CoVs in humans and domestic animals elevates the viral family Coronaviridae to be of great concern as a likely source of new emerging infectious diseases, and a priority for future viral surveillance efforts. Based on our current understanding of CoV systematics, all human CoVs have evolutionary origins in wildlife reservoirs, with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and human-CoVs NL63 and 229E considered to have originated in bats [39, 124, 125] . Moreover, spillover of bat-associated CoVs has occurred into domestic animals, for example SADS-CoV has a 90% mortality rate in young piglets [33, 124] . On a global scale, reported CoV diversity mirrored species richness, suggesting regions with greater species richness will also have higher CoV diversity [9] . We found that research effort on bat-associated CoVs was significantly correlated with species richness across the 247 countries included in our analysis (r = 0.26, p = 0.001) (Table S3 ). However, research effort was greatly skewed towards the United States and China ( Figure 6) , with 71% of all other countries reporting no published research on bat-associated CoVs (Table S4) . Not surprising, China published the most studies on bat-associated CoVs, which is largely driven by targeted efforts to Figure 5 . Research effort on bat-associated viruses by country.

As expected, Saudi Arabia had the highest number of publications returned when searching for bat-associated CoV research in Western Asia (Table S4) , likely because bats are the presumed evolutionary source of the MERS-CoV, a virus that still infects a large number of people each year in the country due to the transmission from dromedary camels to humans [40, 43] . In the absence of many primary studies on CoVs in bats from the region, our PubMed searches would have also identified publications that mention bats in the abstracts and titles, e.g., of review papers [126] [127] [128] [129] . Bat-CoV characterization from Saudi Arabia [40] and Lebanon [130] are two of the notable studies that reported primary results from on-the-ground virus surveillance efforts. More than half of the countries in Western Asia had no published research on bat-associated CoVs (Table 1) , demonstrating a significant gap for a viral family that can cause severe morbidity in human and domestic animal populations.

Compared to countries with greater research effort on bats and bat-associated viruses (i.e., China, United States, Australia, and some European countries) (Figures 3, 5 and 6 ), Western Asia faces diverse systemic challenges that likely impede similar research in the region. Notably, ongoing armed conflict in several Western Asia countries, ranging from war in Afghanistan, Syria, and Yemen to political instability in Iraq and Lebanon to Islamist militancy in Pakistan [131] , threaten the safety of wildlife researchers and have deprioritized government investments in wildlife or zoonotic disease research. Tragically, these conflicts have also directly impacted wildlife researchers, including the murder of a prominent mammalogist (and bat researcher) in Syria for unknown reasons [132] , as well as the continued imprisonment of nine Iranian researchers on suspicion of espionage, a crime punishable by death, for using camera traps to monitor the critically endangered Asiatic cheetah [133] . On the other hand, socio-political turbulence in the region has driven an increase in international concern for global health security. Yet, despite investments by local and foreign governments to support biosafety and biosecurity programs in the region, there remains limited capacity and unequal access to critical infrastructure and resources to improve biosurveillance across Western Asia [134] . Furthermore, until very recently, this region was a low priority for wildlife research funding, and what funding was available for wildlife research was targeted to the conservation of more charismatic species (e.g., Arabian Oryx, Asiatic cheetah).

Threats to wildlife conservation and human and animal health transcend national borders and require transboundary collaborations among multidisciplinary experts to mitigate them. Regional scientific collaborations can strengthen diplomatic relationships, foster exchange of knowledge and resources among researchers, and inform regional policies to address shared threats. This is particularly important in regions identified as potential zoonotic disease hotspots that have largely been overlooked, such is the case for Western Asia. To fulfil this regional gap, EcoHealth Alliance (EHA), a global non-profit organization dedicated to protecting wildlife and public health, formed the Western Asia Bat Research Network (WAB-Net, "wah-bee-net") in collaboration with key regional stakeholders in Western Asia in 2018. The WAB-Net aims to promote collaborative research to improve regional capacity for One Health approaches to mitigate threats to bat populations that also facilitate viral spillover. Given the challenges and research opportunities identified for Western Asia above, there is a critical need to link bat research with public health initiatives in order to achieve "win-win" solutions for bat conservation and zoonotic disease prevention.

Currently bat research within Western Asia is restricted and fragmented, primarily driven by a small number of dedicated individual researchers based at academic, government, and nongovernmental institutions. These researchers are leading efforts to discover new species and address knowledge gaps in topics such as bat diversity, distribution, taxonomy, and conservation [93, 98, 102, [135] [136] [137] [138] [139] [140] . A few existing networks in the region are aligned with WAB-Net and will be included as part of this multinational One Health initiative. For example, the recently formed Bats of Eastern Europe, made up of bat experts from the Caucasus region, held their first international conference in October 2018 in Yerevan, Armenia [141] . Also, entities such as The Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network (EMPHNET) based in Jordan and the Pak One Health Alliance of Pakistan are conducting critical work to improve public health outcomes and disease surveillance [142] [143] [144] . Despite the value and successes of these few established efforts, most research within the region remains either monodisciplinary, or limited in its geographic scope. The WAB-Net aims to fill a critical need to facilitate interaction: (1) among bat researchers scattered throughout Western Asia, and (2) between bat conservationists and those conducting viral disease surveillance within the region. Networking of existing bat researchers into a regional network, together with collaborative efforts to improve disease surveillance initiatives for humans and domestic animals, will help promote One Health solutions to regional threats [14, 145] .

In order to encourage a multidisciplinary, collaborative approach that integrates bat conservation and disease surveillance, WAB-Net aims to: conduct on-the-ground research to bring together regional experts from a variety of disciplines (e.g., bat ecologists, conservationists, virologists, public health officials); strengthen scientific capacity via research exchanges, data sharing platforms, in-region laboratory testing, and annual workshops; and promote the development and leadership of local scientists and officials. Taken together, these activities represent a coordinated strategy to advance scientific knowledge and capacity around transboundary zoonotic disease emergence and bat conservation in Western Asia. Additionally, WAB-Net has formed an initial Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) to help guide and oversee the network, comprised of a group of global experts with backgrounds in bat ecology and conservation, virology and laboratory diagnostics, and wildlife disease ecology. The SAB was formed to review proposed scientific activities, provide expertise during annual data sharing and capacity building workshops, monitor the network's growth and communication, and help liaise with regional and global stakeholders.

Establishing a successful bat One Health research program in Western Asia will require hands-on, hypothesis-driven research projects that integrate applied bat ecology with disease surveillance. International collaborative research is most effective and relevant to policy makers when organized around specific hypotheses and validated with experimental data [146, 147] . Further, international research is most likely to be successful if the specific topics and hypotheses are identified by local (in-region) scientists and stakeholders. Toward this aim, WAB-Net is working with key personnel from throughout the region to develop a robust collaborative research program on bats and bat-associated CoVs. This multinational research program will use a combination of field, laboratory, and analytical methods to address outstanding questions surrounding drivers of host-virus dynamics.

The initial goals of the WAB-Net research program include: identify the link between host and viral diversity, and if host-specific traits predict viral strain diversity; characterize the influence of environmental degradation and bat-human interactions on viral prevalence in disturbed bat populations; compare and contrast the structure and composition of CoV communities across species distributions; and assess virus-host evolutionary relationships between bats and CoVs. While most studies on infectious disease ecology focus on the dynamics of a single host species and single pathogen, we acknowledge that more research is needed to address the complexities of multi host-pathogen dynamics [148] . Community ecology, with its emphasis on the composition of and interconnections between ecological communities, allows one to understand infectious disease dynamics in multi-pathogen, multi-host disease systems that occur across diverse scales (e.g., from within a single host, to between species, to between regions) [148] . Other topics of importance deserving further study in bat species of Western Asia include: effects of extreme weather (e.g., heat waves) on bat survival, including changes in the distribution of bat species (and associated pathogens) and changes in prey abundance or food resources that could alter reproductive patterns and disease transmission [149, 150] . For example, increased prevalence of Marburg virus (MARV) in Rousettus aegyptiacus colonies corresponded with defined periods of synchronized parturition (which resulted in an influx of immunologically-naive, juvenile bats), as well as an increased incidence of spillover into human populations [77] . If such virus-host associations exist in regional bat species, climatic changes may affect reproductive phenology in bats, and therefore the timing of peak viral spillover into human populations. A systems-wide, hypothesis-driven approach will allow for better identification of emerging disease risk factors, and more effective policy recommendations for reducing the disease transmission and spread [146, 148] .

As the founding organization of WAB-Net, EHA aims to serve as a "bridging actor" within the network, leveraging its connections with scientists and other stakeholders in the region and globally to link various actors and accelerate the transfer of knowledge between them, as per Kingston et al. [21] . By adopting the approach that "local problems require local solutions," WAB-Net will empower local scientists to take ownership of field and laboratory research activities and help shape the overall direction of research based on locally identified priorities [21, 151] . The central goals of WAB-Net are to provide support to existing organizations and scientists, strengthen scientific capacity building, and bring together groups in a strategic fashion, so as to ensure maximum effectiveness and resiliency of the network. While EHA is helping to initiate the network, ownership of the research network must ultimately be driven by the partner scientists and stakeholders from the region. In order to achieve long-term sustainability, WAB-Net will incorporate the following elements into its design: (1) in-service training programs, (2) data sharing platforms, (3) communication and networking opportunities, and (4) local leadership. We detail each of these elements of sustainability further below.

In-service training consists of hands-on opportunities for professional training and development to build specific scientific skill sets. One Health networks, in particular, often foster multidisciplinary research that relies on the transfer of knowledge and skills between its members and across disciplines for their success. In-service trainings, particularly through the sharing of best practices and standardized protocols and hands-on training, are meant to provide network members with an operational level of understanding on various subject matters, such that research activities can be replicated across both space and time. The WAB-Net currently consists of two programs designed to equip network members with a diverse set of skills. The first is "in-field trainings," where local scientists are trained by expert bat disease ecologists on how to properly don and remove personal protective equipment (PPE); safely capture, handle, and identify local bat species; and obtain non-lethal diagnostic samples (e.g., saliva, feces, blood, urine) for virus detection. The second is a "field-to-laboratory" research exchange, designed to expose local scientists to every aspect of a multidisciplinary research project (ranging from field collection to laboratory methods to statistical and phylogenetic analyses). This is especially helpful in providing researchers of a given discipline (e.g., bat ecology, virology, epidemiology) with a more complete view of what a cross-disciplinary research project entails. Together, these trainings will promote collaboration and creativity, and provide participants with the skills and perspectives needed to better approach interdisciplinary One Health research.

Research networks exist, in part, to facilitate the transfer of knowledge between members, so as to benefit the activities of individual members and the network as a whole [21, 151] . By establishing a common database and data collection standards, networks make it easier for their members to engage in collaborative projects and to leverage additional resources that may be useful in one's research. Members are encouraged to share data with others in the network but are also allowed the option to withhold certain information as deemed necessary. An important consideration, therefore, when creating a database is to develop data sharing agreements between network members. A good example of this is the EIDITH web-based database developed to collate and curate data for the USAID PREDICT project that operates in ≈30 countries around the world [152] . Such databases are only successful if network participants contribute in a trusting manner. Willingness to share data may be facilitated by individual or country-level security settings that enable restricted access to particular data or datasets, thereby alleviating national concerns about the sharing of potentially sensitive information.

To promote data sharing among its members, WAB-Net has initiated development of a database (wabnet.eha.io) that aims to serve as a multi-use One Health spatial database, storing ecological and viral data, and linking to other infectious disease, ecological, and biodiversity datasets.

Successful bat research networks rely on strong connections among members that are formed through trust, collaboration, and dialogue, and will weaken or cease to exist if any of these elements are missing [21] . Therefore, whether the aim of a network is to bolster relationships between already-connected members or foster new relationships with novel or unfamiliar actors, a network's structure and long-term sustainability are dependent on clear and consistent communication [21, 146] . Several ways to ensure such communication include: participating in scientific conferences, hosting regular workshops, and creating social media and other communication platforms that allow for direct dialogue and information sharing. Scientific conferences, whether domestic or international, act as centers of learning and networking. Individuals can discover new and exciting research paths, present on shared research, and identify new network members. Workshops bring together individuals from disparate fields and provide a space for networking, data sharing, and collaboration to effectively address research gaps within a network's scope. For example, Fair et al. [146] used a systems dynamic model to show that a single 2-week bat-borne surveillance workshop held in 2014 led to a massive interconnected network of scientific relationships and output, which included WAB-Net members. The WAB-Net currently organizes a collaborative workshop held in a different country in Western Asia each year, bringing together bat biologists, virologists, public health officials, and other relevant professionals. The first workshop was held in Tbilisi, Georgia, from 17-20 September 2018, and included 39 workshop participants from 14 countries, of which 21 participants were from 10 countries in Western Asia. Finally, websites and social media accounts can facilitate information sharing and discussion among research teams, and provide the public with information about the network, its members, and ongoing research plans [21, 151] . A dedicated WAB-Net website (www.wabnet.org) is in development to provide essential information to its members and the broader scientific community.

It is also important to point out that to achieve an optimal balance between bat conservation and disease surveillance, it is critical that research findings are reported in a manner that avoids fear-mongering statements and promotes the ecological and economic benefits of protecting local bat populations. If reporting is done improperly and in haste, consequences include the destruction of roosting sites or culling bat populations, which can undermine conservation efforts and can break down trust among network participants. Similarly, accurate and timely reporting of virus surveillance in bats should be coupled with scientifically-informed intervention recommendations to reduce bat-human interactions (e.g., placing bamboo skirts over date palm sap collection pots curtailed the spread of Nipah virus in Bangladesh [153] ). Successfully blending both conservation and public health messaging is difficult, but critical to preventing spillover into human populations and the subsequent retaliatory actions against bats [10, 12, 154] .

Supporting and promoting local scientists in assuming leadership positions and determining the direction of future research endeavors is critical for any successful regional network. Racey [81] discusses a history of foreign-led bat research efforts in non-Western countries, where in many instances, neither permission nor consultation was requested from local researchers. Regarding bat research in Western Asia, there are numerous ways in which foreign organizations can support existing regional institutions. In-country field training, outreach development (e.g., scientific communication), and workshops that promote networking and idea exchange between experts and early career scientists including students, would provide local researchers with the skills and resources necessary to expand on-going research efforts [4] . To this end, WAB-Net aims to support local institutions by: (1) supporting in-region scientists in research topics that they identify as high-priority, (2) assisting young professionals and early career scientists in developing multidisciplinary research skills, (3) conducting all screening of diagnostic samples in regional laboratories to strengthen regional surveillance capacity (currently including the Royal Scientific Society in Amman, Jordan and the R. Lugar Center for Public Health Research in Tbilisi, Georgia), (4) sharing standardized protocols that will be translated into local languages and distributed widely within the region, and (5) engaging with regional policymakers to effectively communicate the relevance of the network's research, and encourage future funding of related efforts.

In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of bats as reservoirs for zoonotic viruses that jeopardize public health and food security, yet are threatened by a multitude of human activities that alter host-virus dynamics. We highlight that Western Asia is a region with a diverse bat fauna comprising 96 species that overlap at the biogeographic crossroads of Asia, Oceania, Africa, and Europe. Through literature searches based on key terms in PubMed, we demonstrate that research on bats and bat-associated viruses is highly fragmented across the region, and severely limited in most countries. Challenges due to political instability and resource availability in some Western Asian countries has likely contributed to this limited research effort on bats and their viruses. We propose that collaborative scientific research-notably a regional bat research network, the Western Asia Bat Research Network (WAB-Net)-could have the ability to rise above such challenges when faced with a common goal and driven by strong network engagement with a mission toward sustainability. The WAB-Net will facilitate cross-border research cooperation to guard against threats posed by humans that jeopardize bat populations and promote zoonotic disease outbreaks, and will serve as a model for the development of additional research networks to study host-virus dynamics in other taxa native to Western Asia, in particular known reservoirs of zoonotic diseases (e.g., rodents in Iran [155] ). We strongly advocate a "bats for peace" mission for WAB-Net by promoting data sharing and a culture of meaningful transboundary scientific collaboration to develop a sustainable bat research network and serve as an instrument for the early detection of zoonotic disease threats in this politically volatile region.

Features and drivers for energy-related carbon emissions in mega city: The case of Guangzhou, China based on an extended LMDI model

Based on the apparent energy consumption data, a systematic and comprehensive city-level total carbon accounting approach was established and applied in Guangzhou, China. A newly extended LMDI method based on the Kaya identity was adopted to examine the main drivers for the carbon emissions increments both at the industrial sector and the residential sector. Research results are listed as follow: (1) Carbon emissions embodied in the imported electricity played a significant important role in emissions mitigation in Guangzhou.

(2) The influences and impacts of various driving factors on industrial and residential carbon emissions are different in the three different development periods, namely, the 10 th five-year plan period (2003)(2004)(2005), the 11 th five-year plan period (2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010), and the 12 th five-year plan period (2010-2013). The main reasons underlying these influencing mechanisms were different policy measures announced by the central and local government during the different fiveyear plan periods. (3) The affluence effect (g-effect) was the dominant positive effect in driving emissions increase, while the energy intensity effect of production (e-effect-Production), the economic structure effect (s-effect) and the carbon intensity effect of production (f-effect-Production) were the main contributing factors suppressing emissions growth at the industrial sector. (4) The affluence effect of urban (g-effect-AUI) was the most dominant positive driving factor on emissions increment, while the energy intensity effect of urban (e-effect-Urban) played the most important role in curbing emissions growth at the residential sector. , et al.

With anthropogenic releases of carbon emissions contributing toward climate change primarily characterized by global warming, many policymakers and scientific-researchers are seeking scales. Therefore, comprehensive inventory and specific boundary are the basis for city-level carbon emissions accounting, as well as local emission mitigation strategies [28] . The second strand of research focuses on the city-level driving factors and influencing mechanisms. Decomposition analysis (e. g. Index Decomposition Analysis (IDA) and Structural Decomposition Analysis (SDA)) and regression method (e. g. Stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology (STIRPAT) model) are the most commonly applied methods for the scientific evaluation and quantitative analysis of factors influencing city-level carbon emissions, especially the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method based on the IDA framework. As shown in Table 1 , the SDA method based on the IO technique applied in the city-level driving factors and influencing mechanisms research in China were mainly focused on the four municipalities (i. e. Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing), because of the available IO data base compiled by the Municipality Bureau of

Statistics. In other words, the IO data sources were lacking in other provincial capital cities and medium-sized cities in China. Consequently, the IDA methods were used more frequently than the SDA methods based on IO technique [59] [60] [61] [62] , owing to its applicability in which each model can be applied to any available data at any aggregation level in a period-wise or timeseries manner [63] [64] [65] , where the preferred one in the LMDI [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] . By means of LMDI method, Wang et al. [46] investigated the main driver for industrial carbon emissions in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei economic band from 1996 to 2010, and the results showed that economic output and energy intensity were both the most important influencing factors. Wang et al. [42] decomposed the influencing factors of residential carbon emissions in Beijing and found that the rising per capita GDP and the declining energy intensity contributed the most to emissions changes during 2000 to 2010. Similar results, conducted by Wang et al. [54] , can also be found in Suzhou city. Zhao et al. [49] decomposed the main drivers for industrial carbon emissions in Shanghai and found that industrial output, energy intensity, energy and industrial structure were major determinants for emissions changes. Shao et al. [50] adopted an extended LMDI method and investigated the techno-economic drivers for industrial carbon emissions in Shanghai, and the results showed that industrial output scale was mainly responsible for emission increments while industrial structure adjustment, R&D intensity, and energy intensity were most significant factors in mitigating emissions. Kang et al. [51] performed a multi-sectoral decomposition analysis of city-level greenhouse gas emissions in Tianjin from 2001 to 2009, including the agricultural, industrial, transportation, commercial and other sectors, and the results showed that economic growth was the most important driver for emissions increments while energy efficiency was primarily responsible for emissions reductions. Hopefully, previous studies about driving factors and influencing mechanisms of city-level carbon emissions performed on China's megacities such as Beijing, Shanghai etc., have made great contributions to the realization of regional low-carbon road map. But, the previous LMDI studies mainly focused on the economic growth effect, the energy intensity effect, the population size effect, and the technology progress effect influencing the change of carbon emissions. It fails to distinguish the effects of economic structure, population structure, and energy structure on the change of carbon emissions. In fact, the strongest factors that offset China's energy consumption and carbon emissions have shifted from efficiency gains to structural changes [74, 75] . Structural indicators combined with other traditional and emerging factors should also be deeply considered and investigated in China's regional energy and carbon researches, which may perform different influencing mechanism in different regions during different development stages. Compared with four municipalities, there were relatively few studies conducting on Guangzhou city, one of China's first-tier cities, with the considerable GDP scale and total energy consumption amount (Table 2) . Meanwhile, Guangzhou has the highest level of per capita GDP and per capita energy consumption than the four municipalities. Guangzhou is the provincial capital of Guangdong province, the most developed coastal region in the southeast of China (Fig 1) . In addition, Guangzhou city is an important manufacturing base in China as well as a pilot zone for low-carbon city announced by China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in 2012. Therefore, Guangzhou city may serve as a demonstration of how to realize the targets of low-carbon city development, thereby highlighting the importance and representativeness of studying its features and drivers for carbon emissions in detail.

The innovation and contribution of this study compared with other references mainly lies in the following two aspects. Firstly, city-level total carbon accounting approach based on the apparent energy consumption data from the comprehensive energy balance table was established. Secondly, driving factors including structural indicators, e. g. economic structure, energy structure, and population structure, were investigated systematically by adopting the newly extended LMDI method based on the Kaya identity and the IDA theory. It was aimed to provide theoretical references for making more targeted policies on energy saving and emission reduction in China's mega cities.

This study is organized as follows: after the introduction, section 2 presents the methodology of city-level carbon accounting in Guangzhou and the method to decompose the changes in carbon emissions during the whole research period. Section 3 addresses the case analysis and the main results of Guangzhou city. Finally, we conclude our study and provide some policy implications for low-carbon city development. 

City-level total carbon accounting As mentioned in Table 1 , urban emissions inventory is the key for city-level total carbon accounting. However, there are accounting discrepancies between the different types of methods [21] . Based on China's energy statistic and the reference approach of IPCC Guideline for National Greenhouse gas Emission Inventories, there are mainly three approach to account, i. e. primary energy consumption (e. g. coal, oil, natural gas, and renewables) [63] , final energy consumption (e. g. coal, oil, natural gas, renewables, and electricity/heating) [61, 62] , and total energy consumption from the "Energy Balance Table" including the aggregate summary of energy production, energy transformation and final consumption [76, 77] . Compared with the primary energy consumption accounting and the final energy consumption accounting, apparent energy consumption data [78, 79] from the comprehensive energy balance table was recommended for this study. As shown in the Table 3 , the comprehensive energy balance table is mainly based on three modules, namely, 1) total energy available for local consumption as a result of interprovincial and international energy trades, 2) input-output of energy conversion transformation for thermal power, heating, coking, petroleum refining, and gas production, 3) final consumption due to primary industry, secondary industry, tertiary industry, and residential consumption. Primary industry, namely, agriculture, mainly includes farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery. Secondary industry includes manufacturing industries and construction industry. Tertiary industry includes transportation, storage, post and telecommunication services, wholesale, retail trade and catering services, and other service sectors. Then, we calculated energy-related carbon emissions by energy types according to the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories based on the apparent energy consumption data from the comprehensive energy balance table, as follows the equation:

Greenhouse gas (GHG) in our case study is referred in particular to carbon emissions-that directly affect climate change, which didn't include other GHGs (i. e. CH 4 , N 2 O, etc.). Where the subscript i is the various fuels in this case study, t means the time in years. C t represents total carbon emissions in year t (in million tons, Mt). E i t represents the total energy consumption of fuel type i in year t (in million tons, Mt), and NCV i is the net caloric value of fuel i. CC i t is the carbon content of the fuel type i, and O i is the oxidation rate of fuel i. The conversion factors, net caloric value, oxygenation efficiency and carbon content of the various fuels are listed in Table 4 .

Data sources, consisting of the gross domestic product including agriculture, production, construction, and service, the population including rural population and urban population, the total energy consumption based on industrial and residential perspective, covering the period from 2003 to 2013, were all available. Economic, population and energy data were collected from the Guangdong Province Statistical Yearbook (2003-2014) and Guangzhou City Statistical Yearbook (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) . Economic data was measured by GDP in Chinese Yuan in time series. Energy data includes physical quantity of total energy consumption by fuel types measured by tons of standard coal equivalent (tce), which were compiled by the Guangdong Province Statistical Bureau and Guangzhou City Statistical Bureau.

As mentioned and reviewed in Table 1 , the LMDI methods based on the IDA theory, were used frequently to quantitatively analyze the drivers of carbon emissions at the city-level. The LMDI technique based on the IDA theory and an extended Kaya identity was conducted to uncover the main driving forces for energy-related carbon emissions in Guangzhou city. The Kaya identity [18, 64, 80, 81] expresses carbon emissions as a product of four underlying driving factors:

Where P represents the population, G represents the GDP, E represents the total energy consumption; G P represents the per-capita GDP, E G represents the energy consumption intensity, and C E represents the carbon intensity of energy. Then, the Kaya identity was extended as follow:

Where X n k¼1 C i (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) represents carbon emissions from agriculture (i = 1), production (i = 2), construction (i = 3), service (i = 4), urban resident (i = 5), and rural resident (i = 6). k (k = 1, 2, 3, . . .n) represents the various energy types in this case study, mainly including coal, coke, crude oil, gasoline, diesel oil, kerosene, fuel oil, LPG, natural gas, and electricity. E i (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) represents total energy consumption by different sectors. GDP i (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) represents gross domestic product by different industries. P urban and P rural represent the total population of urban and rural residents, respectively. TI urban and TI rural represent the total income of urban and rural residents, respectively. AI urban and AI rural represent the average income of urban and rural residents, respectively. Then, Eq (3) can be rewritten as follow:

Where p = P, represents the total population size, UR represents the level of urbanization. g ¼ GDP P , represents the per capita GDP. e i ¼ E i GDP i (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), represents the energy consumption intensity of agriculture, production, construction, service, urban resident, and rural resident, respectively.

, represents the energy carbon intensity of agriculture, production, construction, service, urban resident, and rural resident, respectively. s i ¼ GDP i GDP (i = 1, 2, 3, 4), represents the economic structure of agriculture, production, construction, and service, respectively.

Then, the changes of regional carbon emissions between two years can be decomposed as:

Following the preferred LMDI method proposed by Ang et al. [66, 82, 83] , the various effects of each factor can be quantificationally calculated as:

In the newly established LMDI method, the population effect (ΔC p-effect ), the affluence effect (ΔC g-effect ), the energy intensity effect (ΔC e-effect ), the economic structure effect (ΔC s-effect ), and the carbon intensity effect (ΔC f-effect ). In addition, social and economic factors such as urbanization (ΔC UR-effect ), family income in urban and rural households (ΔC AI-effect ) were analyzed to further explain the changes of carbon emissions at the city level.

Economic development in Guangzhou was described with GDP, which was converted into the 2003 constant prices (Fig 2) . 

According to the urban emissions inventory in Guangzhou and Eq (1), we calculated the energy-related carbon emissions from 2003 to 2013. Total energy-related carbon emissions mainly include two parts, namely, carbon emissions generated in the boundary from fossil fuel combustion and out of the boundary embodied in the imported electricity (Fig 3) . Carbon emissions embodied in the imported electricity need to be calculated by considering the total amount of imported electricity and the corresponding emissions factor of power generation The case of Guangzhou based on extended LMDI model [56] . As for China's power supply system, electricity is supplied by the main six regional grids five-year plan period, respectively.), which were issued by the central government and performed by the local government. But in fact, carbon emissions mitigation in the boundary mainly benefited from contributions of the imported electricity from the neighbors Guizhou and Yunnan provinces via the cross-province electricity trades. During the same period, carbon emissions embodied in the imported electricity dramatically increased 3.236 million tons in 2010 to 4.379 million tons in 2013. Rapidly increasing carbon emissions embodied in imported electricity indicated that there were large amounts of fossil energy were burned for power. Final products-thermal power was consumed in Guangzhou, while carbon emissions were discharged in its neighbor producers. If these carbon emissions embodied in the imported electricity were allocated to the final consumer, Guangzhou would have paid more efforts and implemented more strict mitigation measures to achieve its energy saving and emission reduction targets.

Aiming to have a better understanding of the complex various influencing factors for carbon emissions in Guangzhou city, we decomposed the total carbon emissions into two parts including the industrial sector and the residential sector.

Driving factors of carbon emissions in industrial sector in Guangzhou. Driving factors of carbon emissions in industrial sector were decomposed yearly first (Table 5 ). In order to have a better understanding of influencing factors in long time series, we divided the carbon emissions process into 3 periods (Fig 4) , according to the regional five-year plans for socioeconomic development, combined with a certain historical background.

During the 10 th five-year plan period (2003) (2004) (2005) , Guangzhou announced the overall objective in the 10 th five-year plan that it would take the lead in realizing socialist modernization and building the modernization central city over China. Guangzhou's industrial carbon emissions increased by 6.29 million tons mainly because the rapid economic development. The affluence effect (g-effect) was the dominant positive effect in driving carbon emissions increase, bringing in a 5.43 million tons increase, accounting for 86.34% of the total industrial carbon emissions changes, which was followed by the energy intensity effect of service (e-effect-Service), the carbon intensity effect of service (f-effect-Service), and the economic structure effect (s-effect). In order to achieve the basic standards of modernization (i. e. per capita GDP is more than 5000 U.S. dollar, and the third industry added value accounted for more than 50% of GDP etc.), Guangzhou paid more efforts to foster the three pillar industries (i. e. electronic information manufacturing industry, automobile industry, and petrochemical Table 5 

Period The case of Guangzhou based on extended LMDI model economic structure effect (s-effect). The adjustment of industrial structure in Guangzhou was mainly focused on upgrading the traditional advantage industries (i. e. iron and steel, shipbuilding, machinery and equipment, electricity, paper, and textile etc.) and fostering the new and high technology industries (i. e. Software, new material, new energy, and digital industry etc.), announced in the 11 th five-year plan for socioeconomic development in Guangzhou Driving factors of carbon emissions in residential sector in Guangzhou. Driving factors of carbon emissions in residential sector were decomposed yearly first (Table 6 ) and divided into 3 periods (Fig 5) . Although the residential carbon emissions in Guangzhou accounted for a relatively small proportion of the total carbon emissions, it exhibited a rapid growth trend during the whole research period along with the improvement of urbanization level. The total residential carbon emissions increased from 0.55 million tons in 2003 accounting for 3.61% of the total carbon emissions to 2.01 million tons accounting for 6.59% in 2013. Furthermore, the residential carbon emission increments were mainly generated by the urban residents, which increased from 0. The case of Guangzhou based on extended LMDI model was always two times of the average income of rural residents during the same period. The energy intensity effect of urban (e-effect-Urban) played the most important role in curbing carbon emissions growth, resulting in a 0.26 million tons decrease, accounting for 34.87% of the total residential carbon emissions changes in absolute value. During the 12 th five-year plan period (2010-2013), Guangzhou's residential carbon emissions increased by 0.51 million tons. The affluence effect of urban (g-effect-AUI) and the carbon intensity effect of urban (f-effect-Urban) were the most two dominant positive driving factors on the carbon emissions increment, bringing in 0.49 million tons and 0.29 million tons increase, accounting for 95.88% and 57.43% of the total residential carbon emissions changes, respectively.

The energy intensity effect of urban (e-effect-Urban) played the most important role in curbing carbon emissions growth, resulting in a 0.33 million tons decrease, accounting for 64.95% of the total residential carbon emissions changes in absolute value.

Based on the apparent energy consumption data from the comprehensive energy balance table, a systematic and comprehensive city-level total carbon accounting approach was established and applied in one of the China's mega city-Guangzhou. Total carbon emissions including the fossil fuel combustion in the city's boundary and embodied in the imported electricity out of the boundary were still performing a rising tendency. Carbon emissions embodied in the imported electricity played a significant important role in emissions mitigation in Guangzhou, especially after 2009. Examining the effects of different boundaries on carbon accounting at city level is crucial for the emissions mitigation in urban China.

Then, the newly extended LMDI method based on the Kaya identity was adopted to examine the main drivers for the carbon emissions increments both at the industrial sector and the residential sector in Guangzhou city. Quantitative analyses and time-series analysis were performed on the influencing mechanism for various influencing factors both at the industrial sector and the residential sector for the three different development periods, namely, the 10 th five-year plan period (2003) (2004) (2005) , the 11 th five-year plan period (2005-2010), and the 12 th five-year plan period (2010-2013). The influences and impacts of various driving factors on industrial and residential carbon emissions are different in the three different development periods. Overall, the affluence effect (g-effect) was the dominant positive effect in driving carbon emissions increase, while the energy intensity effect of production (e-effect-Production), the economic structure effect (s-effect) and the carbon intensity effect of production (f-effect-Production) were the main contributing factors suppressing the carbon emission growth at the industrial sector. Considering the high urbanization level in Guangzhou, the affluence effect of urban (g-effect-AUI) was the most dominant positive driving factor on the carbon emissions increment, while the energy intensity effect of urban (e-effect-Urban) played the most important role in curbing carbon emissions growth at the residential sector.

In conclusion, affluence effect-economic growth, was still the most important contributor to the increases in carbon emissions in urban China. However, structural indicators, such as economic structure and energy intensity of different industrial sector, were playing significant negative effects on carbon emissions. In the future, economic structure adjustment and energy intensity improvement at the detailed production industries should be deeply investigated, in order to make these indicators play more negative effects on carbon emissions.

Considering the significant important role played by the emissions embodied in the imported electricity via the cross-province electricity trades, Guangzhou should adjust its current emissions mitigation policies which only consider its emissions occurring within the city's boundary. Guangzhou should make more joint efforts to help its neighbors improve the efficiency of thermal power generation. Guangzhou might make efforts to buy more clean power such as hydropower from its neighbors Yunnan and Guangxi provinces to replace a certain amount of thermal power. In addition, carbon trading scheme [87] about the cross-province electricity trades should be introduced and conducted on the imported electricity in Guangzhou.

In order to further promote the negative effects of the economic structure effect (s-effect), the energy intensity effect of production (e-effect-Production), and the carbon intensity effect of production (f-effect-Production), Guangzhou should pay more efforts to the optimization of energy consumption structure and industrial structure at the industrial sector. (1) Coal consumption in energy mix should be further decreased, while relatively low carbon energy such as natural gas should be accelerated both in the industrial and residential sectors. Renewable energy such as solar PV and hydropower should also be encouraged. (2) Efficiency of thermal power generation should be further improved in Guangzhou, especially the major power plants such as the Pearl River power plant and the Huarun power plant in Nansha district, the Guangzhou power plant in Liwan district, the Hengyun power plant, the Huangpu power plant, and the Ruiming power plant in Huangpu district. (3) Energy consumption structure and energy utilization technique should be also effectively optimized and improved, especially in the pillar industries (i. e. electronic information manufacturing industry, automobile industry, and petrochemical industry), the traditional advantage industries (i. e. iron and steel, shipbuilding, machinery and equipment, paper, and textile etc.) and the new and high technology industries (i. e. software, new material, new energy, and digital industry etc.) in Guangzhou in the current and near future.

Urbanization level of Guangzhou is relatively high than other cities in Guangdong province and even in China. The rapid increase in the average income of urban residents along with the high level of urbanization has made the affluence effect of urban (g-effect-AUI) become the most dominant positive driving factor on the residential carbon emissions increment during the whole research period. The residential energy consumption structure was mainly based on gasoline, liquefied petroleum gas, and natural gas in Guangzhou. In order to further promote the negative effects of the energy intensity effect of urban (e-effect-Urban), more clean fuels such as domestic solar systems should be added to the total residential energy consumption, and low carbon energy consumption behaviors and lifestyles should be advertised and practiced actively. 

Etiology and Factors Associated with Pneumonia in Children under 5 Years of Age in Mali: A Prospective Case-Control Study

There are very limited data on children with pneumonia in Mali. The objective was to assess the etiology and factors associated with community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized children <5 years of age in Mali.

A prospective hospital-based case-control study was implemented in the Pediatric department of Gabriel Touré University Hospital at Bamako, Mali, between July 2011-December 2012. Cases were children with radiologically-confirmed pneumonia; Controls were hospitalized children without respiratory features, matched for age and period. Respiratory specimens, were collected to identify 19 viruses and 5 bacteria. Whole blood was collected from cases only. Factors associated with pneumonia were assessed by multivariate logistic regression.

Overall, 118 cases and 98 controls were analyzed; 44.1% were female, median age was 11 months. Among pneumonia cases, 30.5% were hypoxemic at admission, mortality was 4.2%. Pneumonia cases differed from the controls regarding clinical signs and symptoms but not in terms of past medical history. Multivariate analysis of nasal swab findings disclosed that S. pneumoniae (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.4, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.6-7.0), human metapneumovirus (aOR = 17.2, 95% CI: 2.0-151.4), respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] (aOR = 7.4, 95% CI: 2.3-23.3), and influenza A virus (aOR = 10.7, 95% CI: 1.0-112.2) were associated with pneumonia, independently of patient age, gender, PLOS ONE |

Pneumonia is the leading cause of child mortality from infectious diseases, accounting for an estimated 1 million deaths annually, and mainly affecting children in developing countries [1, 2] . Mortality attributed to pneumonia has decreased since 2000, but remains a major public health concern [3, 4] . The main known causative pathogens reported are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [5] . However, their distribution varies by season and location. Data on the etiology and epidemiology of pneumonia in children in developing countries are still insufficient, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa [6] .

Mali is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a under-five year mortality rate of 123 per 1,000 live births in 2013 according to the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation. It has been estimated that among its 14.9 million inhabitants, each year more than 900,000 pneumonia episodes occur in children under 5 years of age, leading to almost 8,000 deaths annually [7] . A previous descriptive study reported that pneumonia was the most frequent cause of admission, representing 18% of total hospital admissions [8] . However, detailed information was not available on clinical presentation and on the etiology of suspected pneumonia cases [8] . Moreover, no control group was included. The presence of a control group of children without pneumonia would allow better interpretation of microbiological findings, particularly with nasal sampling [9] . In March 2011, Mali included pneumococcal vaccination (PCV13) in a routine immunization program; but vaccine coverage is still low [10] .

The study objective was to assess the etiology and factors associated with communityacquired pneumonia in hospitalized children in Mali.

The Gabriel Touré University Hospital is a 447-bed tertiary-care general hospital located in Bamako. It is a primary care hospital for people living in Bamako and a national reference centre for other patients. Various medical and surgical specialities, including pediatrics, are located in the hospital. The pediatrics department, with a capacity of 150 beds, includes a general pediatrics unit and a neonatal/emergency unit. It receives sick children for primary care and severe cases referred from other healthcare settings. On average, 50,000 consultations and 10,000 hospital admissions occur in the pediatrics department annually. Acute respiratory infections represent 34% of admissions in children, and 15% of child hospitalizations.

Pneumonia cases were hospitalized children who fulfilled the following criteria: -Cough and/or dyspnea, and -Tachypnea, as characterized by the World Health Organization (WHO) in children between 2 and 12 months of age: breathing rate !50 cycles per minute; in children between 12 and 59 months of age: breathing rate !40 cycles per minute) [13] , and -Absence of wheezing at auscultation, and -First symptoms appearing within the last 14 days, and -Radiological confirmation of pneumonia as per WHO guidelines [14] .

The exclusion criterions for cases were presence of wheezing at auscultation, or minors whose parents or legal guardian declined to sign the informed consent statement. Controls were patients hospitalized for surgery or in a routine outpatient practice environment, aged between 2 and 59 months, without any symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness; suspicion of infection of other site was not an exclusion criteria. Cases and controls were matched for age (±1 year) and calendar date of hospital admission (±1 month) to take seasonality into account. Thus, 61% of patients were recruited during the rainy season (May to October) while 39% were recruited during the dry season (November to April).

Samples were collected in the first 48 hours of patient hospitalization. Nasal swabs were taken from all pneumonia cases and controls. To document antibiotic usage history, urine was sampled from cases for broad spectrum antibiotic detection. Whole blood and pleural effusions (in applicable cases) were collected from cases only. Whole blood was distributed in Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) vials for preservation and in dry tubes for serum specimens. EDTA-whole blood samples allowed complete blood count, blood culture and real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the identification of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b. C reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) were measured quantitatively in serum.

Respiratory specimens from nasal swabs and pleural effusions were characterized by FTD respiratory pathogens 21 plus (Fast-track Diagnostics, Luxembourg) based on RT-PCR which included a panel of 19 

Demographic characteristics, underlying diseases, medical history, clinical examination at enrollment, radiological findings, vaccinations, and outcome were recorded prospectively for each patient on a standardized form.

Continuous variables were described as median and interquartile range (IQR), categorical variables as number and percentage. Pneumonia cases we compared to the controls by the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous covariates, and by the Chi 2 test for categorical variables. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess factors associated with pneumonia. Multivariate analyses were adjusted for gender, age, period per quarter, and other pathogens significantly associated with increased risk of pneumonia. Concordance between serotypes detected in nasopharyngeal samples and blood was tested by Kendall rank correlation.

Crude population attributable fraction (PAF) was calculated after univariate logistic regression analysis to quantify the contribution of the each microorganism to pneumonia occurrence. Conceptuality, PAF permits the estimation of the proportional reduction in pneumonia occurrence that would occur if the pathogen was absent (alternative ideal scenario). The formula was the following:

No patient was excluded because of missing data. P<0.05 was considered significant; all tests were bilateral, and statistical analysis was conducted with Stata version 13.0 (Stata Corp.). With at least 100 cases and 100 controls, analyses had 80% power to detect odds ratios (OR)!3 with !20% prevalence of control exposure, whatever the prevalence of case exposure.

The study protocol, informed consent statement, clinical research form, any amendments and all other study documents were submitted to and approved by the institutional ethics committee (Comité National d'Ethique pour la Santé et les Sciences de la Vie). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Among the 119 enrolled cases, 118 conformed with the inclusion criteria and were all sampled. One patient without radiological confirmation was excluded from the analysis. Among the 100 included controls, 2 were excluded because of missing data.

Overall, 216 patient, accounting for 118 (54.6%) pneumonia cases and 98 (45.4%) controls, were analyzed. Among them, 93 (44.1%) were female. The male/female gender ratio was 0.79, and median age was 11 months (IQR: 5-55 months).

Among the 118 patients with pneumonia, 16 (13.6%) were referred from another health center; median length of hospital stay was 7 days (IQR: 6-10 days) for a total of 909 days of hospitalization ( Table 1 ). The median time period between first symptoms and hospitalization was 6 days (IQR: 4-7 days).

Four (3.9%) pneumonia cases presented a ventricular septal defect. None had previous tuberculosis or underlying lung disease. Among cases with pulmonary crackles, 36 (35.3%) were unilateral and 66 (64.7%) were bilateral. Other signs or medical history of pneumonia cases included sickle-cell anaemia (n = 1), dehydration (n = 1), epilepsy (n = 1), goiter (n = 1), edema (n = 1), pallor (n = 1), and trisomy (n = 3).

Among the 47 patients who took antibiotics before hospitalization, 17 (14.4%) received Amoxicillin, 8 (5.6%) Ceftriaxone, 4 (2.8%) Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid, and 3 (2.1%) Cotrimoxazole. Among the 63 cases tested for antibiotic detection testing in urine, 22 (65.1%) were positive; in this population, sensitivity of declared antibiotic use compared with urine detection was low (sensitivity = 51.2%, 95% confidence interval: 35.1-67.1%).

Median CRP level at admission was 21 mg/l (IQR: 6-63, mean: 56.6 mg/l), median PCT level was 4.6 ng/ml (IQR: 0.4-26.4, mean: 31.5 ng/ml). Median CRP and PCT levels were higher in hypoxemic compared with non-hypoxemic pneumonia cases (P = 0.03 and P = 0.007, respectively).

Median white blood cell count was 15,750 Ã 10 9 cells/l (IQR: 10,000-25,700, mean: 20,600 Ã 10 9 cells/l), and median neutrophil percentage was 52.5% (IQR: 31-68, mean: 50.3%). X-rays showed generalized, dense, homogeneous opacification in 24 (20.3%) patients, interstitial syndrome in 24 (20.5%), and alveolar infiltrate in 65 (55.1%), without significant differences according to the pattern of infection (viral, bacterial or mixed). No patient had abscess or pneumothorax, but 4 (3.4%) had pleural effusion.

During hospital stay, pneumonia cases received the following antibiotics: Amoxicillin (n = 111, 94.1%), Ceftriaxone (n = 3, 2.6%), Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid (n = 3, 2.5%), Ciprofloxacin (n = 1, 0.8%), and Vancomycin (n = 2, 1.6%). Fifty-one (43.2%) received oxygen for a median length of 2 days (IQR: 1-3 days), and 3 (2.5%) had blood transfusions. Three patients with pleural effusions were tested for microbial detection. Five patients died (lethality: 4.2%); death was directly related to pneumonia in 4 patients ( Table 2 ). Table 1 compares the clinical signs and symptoms at admission between cases and controls, underlying conditions and biological findings. Pneumonia cases differed from controls regarding clinical signs and symptoms as well as vital signs at admission, but not in terms of demographic factors or past medical history. Pneumonia cases were more frequently hypoxemic (defined as oxygen saturation<90%) at admission than the controls (30.5% vs. 0%, P<0.001). PCV coverage was zero in both groups.

At least 1 microorganism was detected on nasal swabs in 96.6% of cases and 82.3% of controls (crude OR = 6.4, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 2.1-19.7, P<0.001). Overall, 78.8% of cases and 54.2% of controls were co-infected or co-colonized (crude OR = 3.3, 95% CI: 1.8-6.0, P<0.001). Co-detection on nasal swab of S. pneumoniae and RSV was more frequent in cases than in controls (respectively, 15 between cases and controls (respectively, 5.9% [N = 7] vs. 3.1% [N = 3], P = 0.32). A doseresponse relationship was apparent between the number of microorganisms found in nasal swabs and the risk of being a case (Fig 1) . Distribution of S. pneumoniae and RSV differed by season with higher rates of S. pneumoniae in January-June and of RSV in July-September (Fig 2) . Univariate analysis revealed that S. pneumoniae, human metapneumovirus, RSV, and influenza A virus detection in nasal swabs were significantly associated with pneumonia in Mali (Table 3) . Multivariate analysis reinforced linkage of these pathogens with pneumonia, independently of patient age, gender, period per quarter and the presence of other pathogens significantly coupled with increased risk of pneumonia (Table 3) . PAF was the highest for S. pneumoniae (PAF = 46%, 95% CI: 30-59%). Contribution of human metapneumovirus, RSV, and influenza A were lower, with PAFs of 9% (95% CI: 7-11%), 21% (95% CI: 16-25%) and, 8% (95% CI: 6-10%), respectively. Fig 3 reports the distribution of pneumococcal serotypes detected in nasal swabs from cases and controls. The most prevalent serotype in pneumonia cases and controls was serotype 6A/B (18.6% vs. 11.2%, P = 0.13). Serotypes 1 and 5 were more frequent in pneumonia cases than in the controls: 6.8% vs. 0%, P = 0.009, and 4.2% vs. 0%, P = 0.04, respectively.

In pneumonia cases, S. pneumoniae was positive in 16 (13.6%) patients, S. aureus in 6 (5.1%) patients and H. influenza in 5 (4.2%) patients by PCR blood sample detection. Most patients with S. pneumoniae detection by PCR had also S. pneumoniae nasal carriage (93.5%, 15/16), while only 17.6% (15/85) of patients with S. pneumoniae nasal carriage had positive detection by PCR (P = 0.04). Concordance of serotype 1 detected in nasal swabs and blood in pneumonia cases was high (κ = 0.70, P<0.001). Coronavirus 63 was identified from pleural effusion in 1 patient. Microbiological findings, including S. pneumoniae serotypes distribution, from PCR nasal swab or blood sample were not different in pneumonia cases according to the result of urine antibiotic testing (data not shown). Blood culture was positive in 36 (30.5%) pneumonia cases; most microorganisms were probably related to contamination of samples. The following bacteria were detected: coagulase-negative staphyloccoci (n = 26), Salmonella spp. (n = 3), Gram-positive bacilli (n = 2), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1), Aerococcus viridans (n = 1), Enterococcus faecium (n = 1), Granulicatella elegans (n = 1), and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1).

The primary objective of this prospective case-control study was to assess the etiology and factors associated with community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized children in Mali. In this non-PCV population, we observed that S. pneumoniae, human metapneumovirus, RSV, and influenza A were the main microbial agents associated with pneumonia among children in Mali, independently of patient age, gender, period, and other pathogens. H. influenzae was not associated with pneumonia, but the vaccination rate against this bacteria, at least for the first dose, was above 85% in both cases and controls. In addition, while most patients with S. pneumoniae by PCR in blood had also nasal carriage, frequently with the same serotype, positive S. pneumoniae test from nasal sample was not highly predictive of S. pneumoniae detection in blood, meaning that the bacteria was frequently not the cause of pneumonia.

Few studies have assessed the etiology of pneumonia in sub-Saharan Africa. Howie et al. recently investigated pneumonia etiology in children in Gambia, observing that S. pneumoniae was the leading cause with a high rate of microbial agent co-detection [15] . Conversely, they found that viral pneumonia was not predominant whereas we observed that 3 viruses, namely human metapneumovirus, RSV, and influenza A virus, were associated with pneumonia in Mali. Major differences between the 2 studies were sample type (lung aspirates vs. nasal swabs in our investigation) and the lack of a comparative group in the study by Howie et al. which did not permit comparison of microbial prevalence in pneumonia patients and healthy subjects [15] . In a Western Kenya case-control study, S. pneumoniae, RSV, and influenza A virus were the predominant causes of pneumonia in children [16] . We noted almost similar results in Mali. Thus, S. pneumoniae and RSV could still be considered as the primary causes of pneumonia in several sub-Sharan African countries. All patients who died had severe pneumonia, according to WHO criteria, with significant dyspnea, very marked chest indrawing and severe hypoxia. Two patients had confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia. Two patients had acute malnutrition linked with pneumonia. In 2 cases, death occurred within 24 hours of admission. Despite active treatment with antibiotics and oxygen, the management of severe respiratory distress is often difficult in this context because the hospital does not have assisted ventilatory support. Mortality was higher than in a recent birth cohort in South Africa [17] , but was similar to what was reported previously in other developing countries [18, 19] .

Some invasive serotypes were detected selectively in pneumonia cases but not in the controls (i.e., serotypes 1 and 5 were associated with the risk of pneumonia). A previous study of serotypes involved in invasive pneumococcal disease in Mali found that serotype 5 was the most prevalent (54%) [20] . It was also linked with pneumonia in our series. In other sub-Saharan African countries, serotype 1 was described as the most prevalent serotype of invasive pneumococcal disease [21] . It was the second serotype significantly associated with pneumonia in children in Mali. Thus, the introduction of PCV in routine immunization programs in Mali would substantially reduce pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae because most serotypes eliciting pneumonia would be covered by the vaccine [22] . In addition, pneumococcal pneumonia seasonality was similar to that observed previously in Burkina Faso, a neighbouring country, in 2007-2011 with higher incidence during the dry season between January and May [23] . Interestingly, among the 4 microbial agents associated with pneumonia, 3 were viruses: human metapneumovirus, RSV, and influenza A virus. Self et al. recently observed, in a pneumonia cases-control study implemented in hospitals of Utah, that detection respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and influenza from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal sample of patients with pneumonia probably indicates an etiologic role [24] .

We observed similar results in a different context. Despite the dearth of vaccination against pneumococcus in our population, viral pneumonia is a major segment of the pneumonia burden. Treatment of these infections is often problematic because the empirical use of antibiotics or antivirals is not consensual [25] . Vaccine development, particularly against RSV, is warranted to prevent pneumonia in children. Moreover, the impact of influenza vaccine policies in developing countries should be evaluated because this virus often causes pneumonia [26] .

Rhinovirus was detected in almost 25% of pneumonia cases of our series, but the detection rate was not different between cases and controls. However, this observation does formally excludes that rhinovirus could play a role in the etiology of pneumonia. Jain et al. recently observed that rhinovirus was detected in 27% of U.S. children with community-pneumonia requiring hospitalization [27]; this large study had however no control group, it was also not possible to estimate the prevalence of respiratory detection in children without pneumonia. Growing evidence suggests the role of rhinovirus in the etiology of viral pneumonia [28] or related to the risk of secondary bacterial pneumonia [29] . Other viruses, such as bocavirus or adenovirus were also equally prevalent in cases and controls. Again, this finding does not exclude completely their implication in pneumonia etiology in children from Mali. However these viruses were poorly described as causative agents of pneumonia in children from other sub-Saharan African countries.

Several microorganisms have been detected in most pneumonia cases but also in the controls. The clinical significance of microbial detection by PCR is problematic at the individual level because most detected pathogens are not causes of pneumonia. However, number of pathogens is predictive of the risk of pneumonia, suggesting that simple quantification of species detected would permit the evaluation of pneumonia risk. At the population level, nasal samples are interesting because the prevalence of carriage in the controls is considered.

The main strengths of our study were its prospective design with the inclusion of controls that permitted us to assess pneumonia etiologies while taking into account the prevalence of pathogen detection in non-infected patients. Ours is the first case-control investigation of pneumonia etiology in children from Mali (S1 STROBE checklist). The results should serve to better manage pneumonia not only in these children but also in those from neighboring countries. Data quality was enhanced by centralized microbiological analysis in the Emerging Pathogens Laboratory (Lyon, France). In addition, this analysis should serve to better focus multicentric pneumonia studies that will permit us to assess the global etiologies of pneumonia and to compare etiologic agents between countries and continents. Some limitations should be underlined. First, microbiological diagnosis of pneumonia is difficult due to the lack of single reliable test. Then, at the individual level, it is difficult to establish if a positive nasal swab denotes etiology or nasopharyngeal colonization; particularly for bacterial agents such as S. pneumoniae because of the high asymptomatic carriage. However, at the population level, addition of a control group permits to evaluate and control for the prevalence of carriage in asymptomatic children. In a pneumonia etiology study, it would be interesting to correlate the threshold cycle (Ct) values obtained from RT-PCR with lower airway specimens to establish more precisely the relationship between positive nasal swab and etiology of pneumonia, according to the microorganism [30] . Second, because the study was implemented in one hospital in Mali, external validity might be limited. However, Gabriel Touré University Hospital is a reference center in the country, and then source population is not limited to the city of Bamako. Third, study power was confined to detecting some linkages (i.e. serotypes associated with the risk of pneumonia).

Community-acquired pneumonia was mainly attributable to S. pneumoniae, human metapneumovirus, RSV or influenza A among children in Mali. Increased pneumococcal conjugate vaccine coverage in children would significantly reduce the burden of pneumonia in this country. The addition of a control group to assess etiologies of pneumonia in children is critical to properly interpret the microbiological results of diagnostic testing with high sensitivity.

The role of respiratory viruses in the etiology of bacterial pneumonia An ecological perspective

Pneumonia is the leading cause of death among children less than 5 years old worldwide. A wide range of viral, bacterial and fungal agents can cause pneumonia: although viruses are the most common etiologic agent, the severity of clinical symptoms associated with bacterial pneumonia and increasing antibiotic resistance makes bacterial pneumonia a major public health concern. Bacterial pneumonia can follow upper respiratory viral infection and complicate lower respiratory viral infection. Secondary bacterial pneumonia is a major cause of influenza-related deaths. In this review, we evaluate the following hypotheses: (i) respiratory viruses influence the etiology of pneumonia by altering bacterial community structure in the upper respiratory tract (URT) and (ii) respiratory viruses promote or inhibit colonization of the lower respiratory tract (LRT) by certain bacterial species residing in the URT. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to examine temporal associations between respiratory viruses and bacteria and a targeted review to identify potential mechanisms of interactions. We conclude that viruses both alter the bacterial community in the URT and promote bacterial colonization of the LRT. However, it is uncertain whether changes in the URT bacterial community play a substantial role in pneumonia etiology. The exception is Streptococcus pneumoniae where a strong link between viral co-infection, increased carriage and pneumococcal pneumonia has been established.

Pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children <5 years worldwide, which is responsible for one million deaths each year [1] . The burden is greatest in developing countries, at an estimated 0.22 episodes per child-year, but remains a major public health concern even among developed countries where there are an estimated 0.015 episodes per child-year [2] . In the USA, pneumonia is the second only to newborn infant births as the most common reason for hospital admissions (36 cases per 10 000 persons [3] ) and causes nearly 50 000 deaths each year [4] .

A wide range of viral, bacterial and fungal agents can cause pneumonia when aspirated into the lungs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community (EPIC) study identified viruses as the most commonly identified etiologic agent in children and adults hospitalized with pneumonia. An etiologic agent was detected in 81% of 2222 children <18 years of age: 66% had one or more viral pathogens, 8% one or more bacterial pathogens and 7% both bacterial and viral pathogens [5] . Among 2259 adults, an etiologic agent was detected in 38%: 23% had one or more viral pathogens, 11% one or more bacterial pathogens and 3% both bacterial and viral pathogens [6] . However, virtually all these serious pneumonia cases were treated with antibiotics, as secondary bacterial infection can complicate lower respiratory viral infection. Therefore, even in cases determined to be pneumonia solely of viral etiology, bacterial interactions of virus and bacteria may play some role.

The large proportion of pneumonia cases without a detected pathogen underscores the limitations of current surveillance and detection methods and how they frame our understanding of pneumonia etiology (Box 1). EPIC study results suggest we may not be detecting the full panel of pathogens in cases we currently define as viral pneumonia nor considering the potential role of bacteria on the pathogenic potential of viruses. Bacterial causes of pneumonia are associated with more severe clinical symptoms and increasing antibiotic resistance complicates treatment [2, [7] [8] [9] [10] , making bacterial causes of pneumonia a major concern.

In this review, we examine two hypotheses that argue the etiology of bacterial pneumonia is a consequence of ecologic selection influenced by the interaction of respiratory viruses and bacteria within the host: (i) respiratory viruses influence the etiology of pneumonia by altering bacterial carriage structure in the upper respiratory tract (URT) and (ii) respiratory viruses promote or inhibit colonization of the lower respiratory tract (LRT) by certain bacterial species residing in the URT. We begin by describing the normal processes of bacterial selection in the upper and LRTs and then present evidence on how these processes can potentially be altered by respiratory viruses.

We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed for studies published between 1 January 1990 and 9 December 2015. We restricted studies to those conducted in the USA to minimize potential geographic variation of associations. The following search string was used: '(bacteria[All Fields] OR e x p l a n a t o r y b o x 1 . c h a l l e n g e s i n d e t e r m i n i n g t h e e t i o l o g y o f p n e u m o n i a Even in countries where pneumonia surveillance is routinely conducted such as the USA, no information on microbial etiology is recorded for approximately 65-85% of hospitalized pneumonia cases [11, 12] . Severely ill patients often are not included in surveillance, organisms on the causal pathway may have been cleared by the time that the patient presents clinically or prior to testing because of rapid treatment with antibiotics when pneumonia is suspected, and autopsies are infrequently done on the elderly. To optimally determine etiology, direct sampling via bronchoalveolar lavage is required, but usually detection of causal agents is conducted on blood, sputum and urine because of ease of collection, ethical issues and costs. Bacteremia is observed in only 7%-13% of adult pneumonia cases and 1-5% in child pneumonia cases, sputum can potentially be contaminated by bacteria in the URT and is difficult to obtain from children, and blood and urine antigen assays require further validation or are limited to adults and specific to only a few pathogens (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella species) (reviewed by Murdoch et al. [13] ). Although modern molecular biologic techniques make it feasible to conduct untargeted screens for all bacterial, viral and fungal species present, it is still difficult to distinguish between infection, colonization or contamination [14] . Continued efforts are needed to develop more accurate methods to determine the etiology of pneumonia, and thus maximize treatment and prevention efforts. 

Bacterial pneumonia is primarily caused by the commensal bacteria normally residing in the URT [11, 12] . The most common causes of bacterial pneumonia for children <5 years of age are Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus [11] although this varies over time and space. From a rudimentary ecological perspective, the human respiratory tract can be defined as an ecosystem with two distinct niches: the URT, characterized by regular asymptomatic carriage of commensal bacteria, and the LRT, which is inhabited at a low abundance by bacteria in healthy individuals [13] . During the first year after birth, the nasopharynx is rapidly colonized [14] and URT carriage is established via ongoing synergistic and antagonistic interactions among commensal bacteria [15] . Although pneumonia is an infection of the lungs, microbial selection in the URT may play an important role in etiology as bacterial strains in the URT can be readily aspirated into the LRT. For example, URT carriage is believed to be a necessary precursor of pneumonia due to S. pneumoniae [16, 17] .

Numerous epidemiologic studies describe synergistic and antagonistic relationships among various commensal bacteria [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] and, although the exact biological mechanisms remain unclear, in vivo and in vitro experiments suggest potential mechanisms involve either direct interaction between bacterial species or indirect interactions via the host immune system (Table 1) . A number of population studies suggest that S. pneumoniae carriage is positively associated with H. influenzae [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] and Moraxella catarrhalis [18, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] carriage but negatively associated with S. aureus [19, 20, [24] [25] [26] [27] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Furthermore, S. aureus carriage is generally negatively associated with H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis [19, 24, 31] carriage, whereas H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis are believed to be positively associated [18, 22, 24, 33] . Nevertheless, our understanding is limited, as the dynamics of niche competition likely consist of complex relationships between multiple species [31, 34] and strains [15, 35] , further influenced by host and environmental factors [22, 36] . As carriage is an important precursor of respiratory infections for certain bacterial species [12] , unraveling the complex system of bacterial interactions that determine URT microbiota may be key factor for understanding the etiology of pneumonia.

Lung microbiome studies suggest that bacteria colonizing the LRT overlap with those found in the URT, but that the abundance of organisms is quite low [13] , and their role in pneumonia etiology has yet to be explored. To colonize the LRT, an organism must overcome mucociliary clearance and phagocytosis by resident alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages [37, 38] , but many URT pathogens have developed strategies to overcome these barriers. H. influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis resist mucociliary clearance by impairing ciliary function.

Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, H. influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and S. pneumoniae possess capsules that resist phagocytosis [37] . Streptococcus pneumoniae, the leading cause of pneumonia [39] , is characterized by over 90 serotypes differentiated by variations in the bacterial polysaccharide capsule [40, 41] and associated with different propensities of invasive potential [42] . In addition to protecting against phagocytosis, the capsule prevents clearance by mucous secretion and restricts autolysis [43] . Other species, including S. aureus, release anti-opsonizing proteins and possess surface protein A to evade phagocytosis. Furthermore, S. aureus secretes leukotoxins that lyse leukocytes and express superantigens that hinder immune response (reviewed by Naber et al. [44] ).

The crucial role these various mechanisms play in determining respiratory disease is demonstrated by contrasting M. catarrhalis with S. pneumoniae. Similar to S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis is a primary carriage species estimated to colonize between 31% and 50% of children <2 years in the USA [45] and frequently causes URT infections, such as acute otitis media. However, unlike S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis rarely causes pneumonia [46] , suggesting that differences in mechanisms of pathogenicity may be the explanation.

Various other factors-including underlying medical conditions and smoking-can increase the risk of pneumonia by compromising pulmonary clearance mechanisms and the host immune response [47] , potentially influencing the selection of pathogens in both the URT and LRT . Age plays a major role in pneumonia risk. In developed countries, such as the USA, the risk of pneumonia is highest in individuals who are 65 years or over (Fig. 1 ) [48] . The elevated risk in the elderly is likely due to impaired host defenses and an increase in comorbidities-heart failure, liver disease and underlying lung diseasewhich increase risk of aspiration pneumonia that can occur from dysphagia and gastroesophageal reflux disease (reviewed by Akgün et al. [49] ). In developing countries, the burden of pneumonia is greatest in young children [2] due to their inability to physically remove and immunologically deal with bacterial pathogens (reviewed by Siegrist [50] ). Very young children also have the greatest prevalence in the nasopharynx of common bacterial pneumonia pathogens: S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis [23, 51] . Increased carriage may be an important risk factor for pneumonia if the URT bacterial community structure is a determinant of pneumonia etiology. Unfortunately, the majority of carriage studies have been conducted among children <5 years of age, which limits our ability to establish the role of nasopharyngeal carriage in other age groups.

Regardless of age, viral infection is an important risk factor for bacterial pneumonia. Viruses can lead to rapid, drastic increases in morbidity and mortality in all age groups as seen in historic influenza epidemics and pandemics [52] , making it a major public health concern.

The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic resulted in 50 million deaths worldwide: most of the deaths were caused by secondary bacterial pneumonia [53, 54] . During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, bacterial coinfection was detected in 18-34% of influenza cases (reviewed by Chertow and Memoli [8] ) with vulnerability peaking 1 week after influenza infection [55] . The association of viral infection and bacterial pneumonia is not limited to influenza although that interaction has been most studied: adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and other viruses have been temporally associated with an increased risk of pneumococcal pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), defined as the isolation of S. pneumoniae from a normally sterile site, in the USA (Table 2 ) [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] . The majority of US studies suggest strong associations between S. pneumoniae infections (both pneumonia and IPD) and influenza virus and RSV, with potential effect modification by age. Temporal associations with other viruses are less supported and limited to IPD. We did not find any studies in the USA that examined temporal associations between viruses and bacterial species other than S. pneumoniae. Six studies conducted in other developed countries examined temporal associations between respiratory viruses and IPD [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] . Three out of five studies that examined influenza virus found associations with IPD in UK, The Netherlands and Sweden [70, 71, 73] . Among four studies that examined RSV in other countries, two indicated associations with IPD in all age groups [70, 71] , one found an association only among children [68] and the last observed an association only in individuals 2 years or older [69] . Temporal associations provide evidence of virusbacterial interactions, but do not necessarily prove these interactions exist. Many viral infections are seasonal, as is pneumonia infection, so the temporal associations may merely reflect the influence of other seasonal phenomena, environmental or host, that are shared by both viral infection and pneumonia [74] . However, evidence for true virus-bacterial interactions is supported by population studies that estimate a high prevalence of viral co-infection during pneumonia [5, 6] and animal models that suggest increased susceptibility to pneumonia and increased disease severity during viral co-infection [75] . In the USA, 47% of children and 19% of adults with bacterial pneumonia are co-infected with one or more viruses [5, 6] . Further, vaccination for S. pneumoniae reduced pneumonia associated with RSV, influenza A and parainfluenza (PIV) types 1-3 [76] . Influenza vaccine probe studies may provide additional insight to the burden of influenza co-infection on bacterial pneumonia.

Consistent with our first hypothesis, viral infection frequently has been associated with carriage of common pneumonia pathogens. In a cross-sectional analysis of aboriginal and non-aboriginal children in Western Australia, Jacoby et al. [18] observed positive associations between rhinovirus and S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis and a positive association [48] between adenovirus and M. catarrhalis in the nasopharynx. In a US study, children with a viral URT co-infection not associated with otitis media had a higher prevalence of nontypeable H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis relative to healthy children. Furthermore, children with viral co-infection associated with acute otitis media had an increased prevalence of S. pneumoniae, nontypeable H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis but a decreased prevalence of a-hemolytic Streptococci [77] . van den Bergh et al. [26] assessed the prevalence of 20 respiratory viruses and the main commensal bacteria in the nasopharynx of 433 healthy Dutch children aged 6-24 months. In their study, rhinovirus was positively associated with S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, RSV was positively associated with H. influenzae, coronaviruses and adenovirus were positively associated with M. catarrhalis, and influenza virus was positively associated S. aureus (Fig. 2) . However, as the associations found in the above-mentioned studies are based on cross-sectional analyses, we cannot determine whether viruses influenced carriage structure, bacterial carriage influenced host susceptibility to viruses or if bidirectional interactions occurred. Prospective studies are required to resolve this temporal ambiguity.

Although the impact of the host microbiota on viral infections is an important consideration (reviewed by Wilks et al. [78] ), the majority of in vivo experiments pertaining to virus-bacterial interactions in the URT focus on the role of viruses on the host microbiota. The results of these studies suggest that viruses can alter carriage structure by promoting the colonization of certain commensals. In both animal models and human adults, infection with influenza A virus showed increased colonization by S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae in the URT [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] . Similarly, infecting rats and chinchillas with RSV led to increased colonization by nontypeable H. influenzae [84, 85] . Collectively, epidemiologic studies and laboratory experiments suggest that the introduction of a virus to the URT niche can substantially alter the bacterial community present [26] .

Although there is substantial evidence that viral infection influences the URT bacterial community, whether these changes are reflected in the LRT and ultimately in pneumonia etiology is unclear, which weakens our first hypothesis (i.e. respiratory viruses can influence the etiology of pneumonia by altering bacterial carriage structure in the URT). Studies that examine the joint effects of viral coinfection, bacterial carriage and bacterial pneumonia would provide one strategy for filling this gap. However, we found only two such studies. In a South African hospital-based surveillance study of severe acute respiratory illness, 969 nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal specimens were tested for S. pneumoniae and a panel of respiratory viruses. A high pneumococcal colonization density in the nasopharynx and oropharynx was associated with both respiratory virus co-infection and pneumococcal pneumonia [86] . A second hospital-based casecontrol study compared nasopharyngeal carriage among 274 radiologically confirmed cases of pneumonia, 276 cases of other LRT infections and 350 controls in Vietnam. Their findings for S. pneumoniae were similar to that of the South African study. However, the investigators also studied H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis and found no clear association between viral co-infection, nasopharyngeal bacterial load and pneumonia for these species [87] . As noted above, M. catarrhalis rarely causes pneumonia, but H. influenzae is second only to S. pneumoniae. Although there appears to be a persuasive argument for a link between viral co-infection, carriage and pneumonia for S. pneumoniae, whether or why the interaction is not true for other URT bacteria needs further exploration. In particular, studies that can directly test whether viral infection led to bacterial colonization or overgrowth by a potential pathogen, which led to bacterial pneumonia by that pathogen, are in order. In conclusion, there is no definitive answer to our first hypothesis. Epidemiologic studies and experiments indicate viruses alter the bacterial community in the URT, but they do not yet adequately address whether these changes in the URT bacterial community play a significant role in pneumonia etiology.

There are several studies that support our second hypothesis, that respiratory viruses can promote bacterial colonization of the LRT by certain commensals in the URT. Viruses interact with bacteria and the host at various stages along the pathologic pathway to promote bacterial pneumonia (Table 3) . For example, virus can increase shedding of URT bacteria into the LRT: in vitro biofilm and murine studies suggest influenza A virus infection can lead to the dispersion of S. pneumoniae biofilms, releasing virulent pneumococci for subsequent secondary infections in the LRT [88, 89] . When in a biofilm, S. pneumoniae is less virulent; capsule polysaccharide and pneumolysin production are reduced and synthesis of the bacterial adhesin phosphorylcholine increased [90, 91] . Viral infections also can promote bacterial adhesion to host cells [92] [93] [94] . Influenza and PIV promote bacterial adhesion with respiratory epithelium cells by cleaving sialic acid and exposing receptors on host cell oligosaccharide chains [95, 96] . In vitro and in vivo experiments suggest free sialic acid released by viral neuraminidase can behave as signaling molecules promoting pneumococcal biofilm formation, nasopharyngeal colonization and bacterial spread to the lungs [97] . Free sialic acid is believed to play a role in invasion by nontypeable H. influenza as it is an important component of the biofilm matrix and incorporated into the bacterial capsular polysaccharide to evade host defense mechanisms [98] . Although literature is scarce, the relationship may be bilateral as bacterial neuraminidase can promote virus survival during treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors [99] . In addition, viruses can promote bacterial adhesion by upregulating cell surface receptors for pathogenic bacteria. For example, RSV and PIV-3 infection can lead to upregulation of receptors intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), and platelet-activating factor receptor (PAF-r) to promote binding of nontypeable H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae to epithelial cells [100] .

Respiratory viral infection can damage and impede the repair of respiratory epithelial cells leading to reduced mucociliary clearance. Consequently, bacteria can more easily enter the lungs to cause pneumonia [75] . Many of the virus-bacteria interaction mechanisms involve viral compromise of the innate immune system. These include impairment and depletion of resident alveolar macrophages [101] [102] [103] and neutrophils, which are necessary for bacterial clearance, mediated by induction of type I interferons [104] and desensitization to Toll-like receptor ligands [105] . Detailed descriptions of potential biological pathways involved in these mechanisms are discussed in earlier reviews by Robinson et al. [55] and McCullers [9] . Finally, excessive inflammation in the lungs due to virus-initiated exacerbation of inflammatory mediators, cytokines and chemokines, can cause tissue damage [6] , which increases susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections.

Despite the considerable literature on potential mechanisms of viral-bacterial interactions that may lead to pneumonia, most studies are limited to experiments conducted in animal models using select viral and bacterial strains, which may not reflect what is occurring in human populations. Furthermore, the interactions between virus and bacteria are undoubtedly far more complex than identified in animal models, and likely consists of a complex web of interactions between different viruses and bacteria with viruses similar to that described in the URT [12, 26] . Even after considering these limitations, the overwhelming evidence for the existence of multiple biological mechanisms under various conditions supports our second hypothesis that respiratory viruses can alter bacterial selection in the LRT and is an important factor in pneumonia etiology.

In this review, we discussed how the respiratory tract is an ecosystem with two niches, the URT and the LRT; each with ecological and microbial pressures that determine bacterial selection. We hypothesized that viruses influence bacterial selection in the URT leading to colonization of the LRT and sometimes pneumonia. There appears to be a complex network of interactions among viruses and bacteria in the URT that responds to viral introduction by altering what bacteria are present or modifying their relative abundance. For a least one species, S. pneumoniae, viruses can increase nasopharyngeal carriage density and increase risk of pneumococcal pneumonia. Whether this is true for other URT bacteria that cause pneumonia is uncertain. We also proposed that bacterial selection in the LRT could be altered by viral infection. The LRT is normally inhabited by low density of microbes, a state maintained by local host defenses and bacterial mechanisms of evasion. In vitro and in vivo studies suggest viruses can promote entry and colonization of the LRT for select bacterial species via a range of biological mechanisms including URT biofilm dispersion, increased bacterial adhesion to host epithelial cell by upregulation of cell receptors, reduced pulmonary clearance, impairment of multiple components of the innate immune response and changes in inflammatory response. Although there are limitations in interpreting the results of experiments, evidence of numerous mechanisms observed under various conditions strongly suggest that viruses also play an important role in the selection of bacteria in the LRT and pneumonia etiology.

The greatest difficulty in addressing our hypotheses was our inability to determine the relative contributions of URT bacterial community structure and local host defenses on bacterial selection into the LRT. In the simplest case, how much is the risk of pneumonia following viral infection attributable to the presence of a known bacterial pneumonia pathogen (such as S. pneumoniae) in the URT? To determine this, studies must examine timedependent carriage of bacteria, species-specific pneumonia outcomes and the effects of viral coinfection among other known risk factors-which, to the best of our knowledge, do not currently exist. Nonetheless, the literature strongly supports the presence of an interaction between viral infection and secondary bacterial pneumonia; the failure to fully understand the mechanisms should act as a spur for future studies while continuing current efforts to reduce the worldwide burden of pneumonia.

Post weaning diarrhea in pigs: risk factors and non-colistin-based control strategies

Post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) is one of the most serious threats for the swine industry worldwide. It is commonly associated with the proliferation of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli in the pig intestine. Colistin, a cationic antibiotic, is widely used in swine for the oral treatment of intestinal infections caused by E. coli, and particularly of PWD. However, despite the effectiveness of this antibiotic in the treatment of PWD, several studies have reported high rates of colistin resistant E. coli in swine. Furthermore, this antibiotic is considered of very high importance in humans, being used for the treatment of infections due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria (GNB). Moreover, the recent discovery of the mcr-1 gene encoding for colistin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae on a conjugative stable plasmid has raised great concern about the possible loss of colistin effectiveness for the treatment of MDR-GNB in humans. Consequently, it has been proposed that the use of colistin in animal production should be considered as a last resort treatment only. Thus, to overcome the economic losses, which would result from the restriction of use of colistin, especially for prophylactic purposes in PWD control, we believe that an understanding of the factors contributing to the development of this disease and the putting in place of practical alternative strategies for the control of PWD in swine is crucial. Such alternatives should improve animal gut health and reduce economic losses in pigs without promoting bacterial resistance. The present review begins with an overview of risk factors of PWD and an update of colistin use in PWD control worldwide in terms of quantities and microbiological outcomes. Subsequently, alternative strategies to the use of colistin for the control of this disease are described and discussed. Finally, a practical approach for the control of PWD in its various phases is proposed.

Post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) due to Escherichia coli is an economically important disease in pig production worldwide, affecting pigs during the first 2 weeks after weaning and characterized by sudden death or diarrhea, dehydration, and growth retardation in surviving piglets [1, 2] . Furthermore, many stress factors associated with the weaning period, such as removal from the sow, dietary changes, adapting to a new environment, mixing of pigs from different farms and histological changes in the small intestine, may negatively affect the response of immune system and lead to an intestinal gut dysfunction in pigs [3] [4] [5] . Post-weaning diarrhea is usually associated with proliferation of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) [2, 6] . This pathotype is characterized by the production of enterotoxins and adhesins, both essential for disease development [7] , the predominant adhesins in PWD being F4 and F18 [6, 8] . Small intestinal adhesion and subsequent colonization by ETEC in pigs is mediated by F4 or F18 specific receptors, the existence and function of these receptors being crucial to determine the susceptibility of pigs to ETEC infections [7] . The predominant serogroup of ETEC associated with PWD in pigs worldwide is O149, commonly in the combination O149: LT: STa: STb: EAST1: F4ac [2] . Colistin, a polymyxin antibiotic produced by Paenibacillus polymyxa var colistinus [9] , is widely used for the control of PWD in pigs [10] . However, in humans this antibiotic is now considered as the last therapeutic option for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter species [11, 12] .

On the other hand, in the last several years, studies have reported the isolation of colistin-resistant E. coli from pigs [13, 14] , the proportion reaching 35% in some countries [15] . Until recently, resistance to colistin had only been associated with non-transferable genome mediated mutation. However, in 2015, a stable plasmidmediated gene, mcr-1, encoding a phosphoethanolamine transferase conferring resistance to colistin was identified in certain GNB, such as E. coli and Salmonella, isolated from various origins including farm animals, raw meat and humans, in several countries [16] [17] [18] . The discovery of a mechanism for horizontal transfer of colistin resistance, and hence the potential for interspecies transfers, gave rise to a strong reaction in the scientific community regarding the potential reduction of colistin effectiveness in human medicine [19] . Food producing animals, and in particular pigs, have been singled out as the most potential reservoirs for spread and amplification of colistin resistance [19] . Thus, scientists and regulatory agencies such as the European Medicine Agency (EMA) have recommended reducing the use of colistin in animal production and to restrict its use to the treatment of sick animals as a last resort option [20] . In addition, several studies have reported coexistence of the mcr-1 gene with genes encoding the production of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) and carbapenemase enzymes [21] [22] [23] . This constitutes an additional degree of concern about the risk of spread of resistance against antimicrobials of very high importance in human medicine. Furthermore, a high prevalence of ESBL-positive E. coli isolated from PWD piglets has been reported [24] . Taken together, these findings underline the need to better understand PWD risk factors and to find alternatives to antimicrobials and particularly to colistin in pigs for the control of PWD in order to manage antimicrobial resistance and maintain at the same time livestock productivity. Hence, the aim of the present review was to provide an overview of risk factors of PWD as well as an update of information on the extent of colistin use in PWD control worldwide in terms of quantities and microbiological outcomes. In addition, alternative strategies to the use of colistin for the control of this disease are described and discussed. Finally, a practical approach is proposed for the control of the PWD in its various phases.

The prevalence of colistin resistance in pigs and the possible link between colistin pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) and emergence of resistance in Enterobacteriaceae in swine, as well as the aspects that should be considered to ensure judicious use of colistin in swine production, have been investigated in our last two reviews [18, 25] .

Post-weaning diarrhea is an economically important enteric disease in pigs due to financial losses [1] . This disease occurs most frequently within the 2 weeks after weaning and is characterized by a profuse diarrhea, dehydration, significant mortality and loss of body weight of surviving pigs [2] . Mortality associated with this disease may reach 20-30% over a 1-to 2-month time span among infected weaned pigs during acute outbreaks of PWD [1] .

PWD is a multifactorial disease where the exact cause has not yet been identified [26] (Fig. 1) . The occurrence of PWD in pigs involves interactions between the sow, piglet, environment, ETEC bacteria and livestock management [27] .

Post-weaning diarrhea is usually associated with the proliferation of one or more strains of β-hemolytic ETEC in the small intestine of pigs, in particular those that express fimbrial adhesins F4 (K88) or F18 [2] . Thus, small intestinal epithelial cell adhesion and subsequent colonization by ETEC is mediated by F4-or F18-specific receptors (F4R or F18R), the existence and function of which are crucial in determining the susceptibility of pigs to ETEC infection [2, 7] . The genetic predisposition of the pig is primordial for the development of PWD [28] .

In addition, conditions related to pregnancy and parturition of the sow such as litter size, parity, and postpartum dysgalactia syndrome are significant in the predisposition of piglets to microbial infection [27, 29] . The sow placenta is not permeable to maternal immunoglobulin transport and therefore newborn piglets acquire maternal immunoglobulin from colostrum during the first 24-48 h of life [5] . It was reported that weaning age and pre-weaning health play a key role in the onset of PWD [30] . Moreover, the post-weaning period is a critical phase in the pig's life when the intestinal immune system is immature, and the sow milk removal, and consequent discontinuation of nutritive intake of the IgA present in this milk, contributes to increase susceptibility of pigs to microbial infections [31] . Indeed, unlike other food animals, the sow's milk is particularly rich in IgA compared to colostrum [32] . Studies investigating the profitability of weaning pigs at an early age, before 21 days, have further encouraged moving away from this practice to weaning pigs no earlier than 26 days of age to reduce the occurrence of PWD [30, 33] . In the European Union (EU), many pig producers wean piglets at 21 days of age. However welfare legislation encourages weaning no earlier than 28 days of age in the absence of cleaned housing sections to ensure that healthy pigs are transferred into nursery accommodation [34] . Moreover, studies suggest that increasing weaning age reduces stress associated with this period and allows pigs to have a more mature gastrointestinal tract and become increasingly familiar with solid feed during lactation with an improvement in growth performance and in immune response [34, 35] .

Feed intake is usually reduced initially after weaning and the pig may develop anorexia of variable duration and extent between farms, depending on livestock management and the nature of the feed [36] . Madec et al. [30] reported that the low feed intake over the first week after weaning is strongly correlated with the risk of disease occurrence over the post-weaning period. Underfeeding during weaning reduces growth performance of pigs, and contributes to intestinal inflammation and adversely affects villous height and crypt depth [3] . This morphological disruption of the intestinal mucosa promotes the creation of an ideal environment for the multiplication of bacteria such as E. coli and allows toxins and bacteria to cross the epithelium as a result of this inflammation [37] (Fig. 2) .

Housing factors, population density, parity segregated production and the feeding regimen after weaning play a role in the development of PWD [38] . It is beyond the scope of this review to discuss in detail all the ideal conditions for pig housing during the post-weaning period, but to highlight the most important, as reviewed by Le Dividich and Herpin [39] , it is essential to provide the correct environmental temperature, 26-28 °C, to maintain pigs in their thermo-neutral zone. Chilling reduces intestinal peristaltic activity and consequently increases bacterial colonization, and low temperatures in weaner facilities appears to be responsible for a more severe course of PWD [40] . Also, it has been shown that automatic temperature control in the weaners housing reduces considerably the prevalence of PWD [38] . Wathes and Whittemore [41] reviewed several recommendations to prevent pig diseases by appropriate housing and environmental management. These approaches involve avoiding drafts while removing moisture and gases using adequate ventilation. Most often, flat decks are used instead of soiled bedding for weaned piglets; however it was reported that this practice is accompanied by more tail and belly lesions among pigs [42] . Moreover, the removal of manure and soiled bedding on a regular basis is also important to reduce the microbial load on farms.

A contradiction was found in the scientific literature concerning the impact of herd size on the prevalence of PWD in pigs. Indeed, Laine and collaborators reported that in Finland, the increase in pig's herd size was associated with a higher risk of PWD in pigs [38] . While, in Canada, Amezuca et al. [43] reported that PWD occurred on a variety of farm types and sizes. However, a link between stocking density and PWD was described in pig's farms in some countries [30, 44] . Mixing piglets from different farms is a common practice in pig husbandry, particularly at weaning. This mixing can result in fighting as the pigs strive to establish dominance relationships, with most aggressive interactions being typically shown during the first few hours after grouping [45] . It has been reported that the hierarchical behaviour among pigs leads to very significant differences in food and water consumption on farms [46] . Production based on segregated sow parities was proposed as a solution to reduce the impact of the social hierarchy. This system of grouping according to the sow's farrowing rank reduces disease challenge by reducing variation in the immune status of the piglets [47] .

It was shown that the prevalence of PWD was higher on farms that fed weaned piglets only twice a day with a restricted amount of feed than on farms that provided more than two meals per day with or without feed restriction [38] . In addition, Amezuca et al. [43] reported that the occurrence of PWD was greater with pelleted feed and inadequate feeder space per piglet in the pen.

A previously mentioned, PWD is a complex disease that may result from interaction between several infectious agents. However, most epidemiological studies have focussed on monitoring the effect of only one pathogen in the occurrence of this disease, and there is inadequate information concerning other relevant enteric pathogens such as viruses and parasites. Some investigations of mixed infections in PWD showed that rotavirus was considered to be an important enteric pathogen in weaned piglets with a prevalence of 77.5%, followed by E. coli, coccidia, sapovirus and Cryptosporidium parvum with prevalence of 55, 10, 2.5 and 2.5% respectively [48] . In addition, infection by the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSv) results in an impairment of the immune response of piglets, permitting ETEC to cause a septicemia leading to death [49] . However, these data were reported more than 10 years ago and are unlikely to reflect the current epidemiologic situation.

ETEC is the most common cause of PWD in pigs. This pathotype is characterized by the production of enterotoxins and adhesins, both essential for disease development. Enterotoxins produced by ETEC may be heat stable [STa, STb, or enteroaggregative E. coli heat stable enterotoxin 1 (EAST1)] or heat labile (LT) [2] . Enterotoxin genes are on plasmids of ETEC bacteria and act on the intestinal epithelium of pigs [7] .

In pigs, the most frequently found fimbrial adhesins of ETEC are K88 (F4), K99 (F5), 987P (F6), F41, and F18 [40] . F4-positive and F18 ETEC (ETEC: F4 and ETEC: F18) strains represent the major cause of PWD in pigs. F4 are flexible fimbriae that occur as the F4ab, F4ac, or F4ad variant, the F4ac variant being by far the most important type encountered in PWD [50] . The F4 fimbriae mediate bacterial attachment to F4 receptors (F4R), present on the small intestinal brush borders of villous enterocytes allowing ETEC to survive and persist in the small intestine and cause diarrhea [51] . Thus, attachment of ETEC to the pig intestinal mucosa is a crucial step in the pathogenesis and the initiation of PWD. Two antigenic variants of F18 fimbriae exist: F18ab (F107) and F18ac (2134P and 8813). F18ac is commonly associated with ETEC causing PWD, whereas F18ab is often involved in oedema disease [52] . No cross protection between F18ab and F18ac was observed on vaccination against F18 variants [53] . A nonfimbrial adhesin identified as AIDA (adhesin involved in diffuse adherence) has been observed to be associated with ETEC strains recovered from pigs with PWD [54] . In this study, 50.0% of isolates were ETEC-aidA + . Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the expression of AIDA by a diarrheagenic E. coli strain (AIDA-I + , STb + ) was essential for pig's intestinal colonization and for in vitro bacterial autoaggregation and biofilm formation [55] .

Porcine pathogenic E. coli involved in PWD typically belong to serogroups O8, O138, O139, O141, O147, O157 and O149, the latter being the predominant serogroup in most countries [56, 57] . The most implicated virotype in PWD is ETEC: LT: STb: F4 [6] . However, O serogroup and virulence gene patterns vary from region to region and over time [2] .

Pathogenesis of porcine enteric colibacillosis has been reviewed extensively elsewhere [7, 40, 57] . Indeed, piglets ingest ETEC found in their environment, especially derived from mammary glands of their mother and from the farrowing room or from the pen environment on arrival in the nursery (Fig. 2) . These ETEC originate from the gut of piglets with ETEC diarrhea, or subclinical carrier animals at the farm [57] . ETEC bacteria adhere to pig's small intestinal epithelium, causes an increase of water and electrolytes secretion into the intestinal lumen generated by the release of enterotoxins, and alter the functions of enterocytes by increasing secretion and reducing absorption [7] . Excessive secretion of electrolytes and water leads to dehydration, metabolic acidosis, osmotic diarrhea and possible death [28, [58] [59] [60] (Fig. 2 ). It has been widely reported in the scientific literature that ETEC challenge in pigs was not associated with significant macroscopic lesions or morphological changes in the intestinal mucosa resulting from the toxic activity of ETEC enterotoxins [57, 61, 62] . However, other studies have reported that the necropsy of challenged pigs with ETEC or naturally infected animals, has revealed several lesions such as; dehydration, dilation of the stomach and the small intestines, gastric infarcts in the mucosa of the stomach, and congestion of the mucosa of both the small intestine and the colon [57, 63] . Furthermore, ETEC infections in pigs may also result in a shock syndrome with hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, congestion, renal hemorrhage, and thrombi in the mucosa of the stomach and small intestine [64] [65] [66] . Moreover, intestinal ETEC infections in pigs might be associated with secondary septicemia [66] and inactivation of the hemolysin structural gene (hlyA) of an ETEC: F4 challenge strain did not decrease the incidence of this septicemia in orally challenged gnotobiotic piglets [66] . Thus, macroscopic lesions of shock syndrome and septicemia related to ETEC infection in the post weaning period in pigs are probably the consequence of the rapid release of bacterial LPS from the pig's intestine into the systemic circulation [57] . On the other hand, microscopically, ETEC challenge in pigs has been associated with a greater villous atrophy and a large crypt depth reduction in all segments of the intestine of challenged animals [67] .

ETEC isolates from pig farms with PWD may show a high frequency of resistance to multiple antimicrobials [1, 68] . Nevertheless, there is no indication that drug resistance enhances the virulence of ETEC, although virulence genes are sometimes associated with drug resistance genes [56] .

Porcine attaching and effacing E. coli (AEEC) induce intestinal lesions similar to those produced by enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) in humans, and this pathotype is found in pigs with PWD [40] . These E. coli carry the eae gene encoding a 94 kDa outer membrane protein (intimin) which is responsible for intimate attachment to epithelial cells. However, the pathogenic significance of porcine EAE positive isolates in weaned pigs is still unknown [2] . Furthermore, identification of porcine EPEC is difficult and many veterinary diagnostic laboratories do not routinely screen for this pathotype of E. coli, isolates of which do not usually possess any of virulence factors of classic PWD or oedema strains [40] .

The global demand for colistin in agriculture is expected to reach 16,500 tons by the year 2021, this being one of the least expensive classes of antimicrobials available in veterinary medicine in some countries [17] . Thus, the pricing structure makes colistin particularly attractive for use in pig production. Since the inception of its clinical use in 1960, colistin has been used in pig production in many countries for the treatment and prevention of digestive disorders caused by Enterobacteriaceae, and even sometimes for growth promotion over long periods, to improve growth rate and feed conversion efficiency in pigs [18, 69, 70] . In certain countries such as Canada, where colistin has not been approved for use in pigs, a rapid increase in resistance of ETEC to a wide range of antimicrobials has prompted the use of colistin in weaned pigs under the veterinarian's responsibility [71] . However, current data on the total quantities of colistin used in pigs worldwide have been difficult to obtain accurately [70] . Some data, for example in Denmark, indicate that the use of colistin for the treatment of sows increased between 2002 and 2008 [72] . Of the two forms of colistin commercially available, colistin sulfate (CS) and colistin methanesulphonate sodium (CMS), and only CS is approved in pig production in some countries [18] . Usually it is administered orally in the drinking water at the dose of 50,000 IU/kg body weight every 12 h for 3 or 5 days [25] . Colistin is mostly used in monotherapy in pigs, although it may be combined with other antimicrobials, such as amoxicillin, for the treatment of PWD [25, 73] .

Due to its activity directed against GNB, colistin is widely used for the control of PWD in pigs [10, 74] . Two surveys conducted in pig farms in Belgium, in 2006 [73] , and 2012 [74] confirmed that colistin was the most frequently used antimicrobial for the control of PWD, being mostly used prophylactically. However, colistin was underdosed in 90 and 53% of the cases, in the first and the second survey respectively. In Germany, it was reported that intestinal diseases in weaners were commonly treated with colistin, pigs being treated 9.7 days (median) per 100 days with this antibiotic, although tetracycline and tylosin were also used in approximately equal amounts [75] . In a study in France, it was reported that 90% of pig farms used colistin during the post-weaning period [10] . In Vietnam, a survey conducted on pig farms representing three different animal production systems (farm household, semiindustrial and industrial) showed that colistin was the most commonly used antimicrobial for prevention and therapy of gastrointestinal disorders in pigs [76] .

It has been reported that China is the country with the greatest use of colistin in pigs worldwide [17] , although we did not find any reports in the literature on surveys of colistin use in this country in the post-weaning period. Overall, colistin is widely used in the management of the PWD, with a lot of differences between countries in terms of quantities used and modality of administration [18] .

Most of the recent studies conducted in pigs have used CS in experimental conditions for the control of diarrhea in the post-weaning period ( Table 1) . Several of these studies were performed to examine the effectiveness of alternative substances to colistin in the treatment of PWD [77, 78] .

It is often difficult to compare results between studies, because of the variability in the dose of CS used, treatment duration, and the experimental design of the study. In Table 1 , we have summarized the main results reported in the literature concerning fecal E. coli shedding and pig performance following oral CS treatment. Several studies have also followed histological (i.e. intestinal mucosa morphology) and biochemical (e.g. d-lactate, nitric oxide, xylose, etc.) parameters subsequent to CS use in the post-weaning period in pigs [78, 79] . In order to evaluate the effect of colistin on fecal E. coli shedding, bacterial quantification was performed in most studies using culture methods [28, 77] , whereas other studies used real-time PCR [79, 80] . Furthermore, the oral use of a high dose of colistin in healthy piglets was not associated with a major perturbation in the pig gut microbiota as demonstrated by a high-throughput sequencing method [80] .

Although colistin has been used in some studies to promote animal growth, data were not conclusive to support the effectiveness of this practice [81] . In this study, no difference was observed between the CS treated and the control group in terms of average daily gain per day (ADG/day) [81] . Also, the economic benefits of antimicrobial growth promotion in modern farms have been questioned [82] , the benefit of this use being associated with poor hygiene on farms.

Reduced colistin usage in livestock and particularly in swine is highly promoted worldwide and is required in Europe as a public health measure to reduce colistin resistance spread, and to prevent the loss of polymyxins effectiveness in human medicine [25] . Furthermore, concurrent treatment with colistin in piglets was associated with the isolation of resistant bacteria from the earliest days of treatment [28] . Almost all studies conducted on isolates from pigs worldwide to screen mcr-1 gene presence in enterobacterial species reported that colistin resistant isolates harboring this gene also showed resistance to one or several classes of antimicrobials conventionally used in swine such as: aminoglycoside, sulphonamide, trimethoprim, tetracycline, quinolone, lincosamide, β-lactam, and third generation cephalosporin [83] [84] [85] [86] .

However, to ensure swine welfare, productivity and reduced mortality associated with PWD, alternatives to colistin and other antimicrobials, especially those of critical importance for human health, are essential in pigs. There is a major debate over the terminology 'alternative to antibiotics' because we do not propose substances with antibacterial activity but rather substances that act on bacteria indirectly, either by stimulating the host immune system, by the release of substances that have antibacterial activity or by improving the host gut health and consequently growth performance [87] . Thus, we will use the terminology «strategies» or «measures» to describe alternatives to antimicrobials. Due to the multifactorial etiology of PWD, finding case-specific preventive measures against this disease is a challenge for both researchers and veterinarians. Here we give an overview of these preventive strategies, focusing on the most practical and promising ones for the control of PWD in pigs.

In the literature, many alternatives to antimicrobial usage in food-producing animals have been reported and discussed [87] [88] [89] [90] . The most promising way to mitigate the development of colistin resistance is to reduce the use of antimicrobials at the farm level (Table 2 ). There are documented relationships between housing conditions and incidence of PWD in pig herds; Madec et al. [30] claimed that prevention of PWD disorders could be based solely on the control of zootechnical conditions. Moreover, stocking density reduction could be considered as a paramount strategy to decrease occurrence of PWD as well as other diseases in pigs [91] . Thus, improvement of breeding conditions in pig farms is a crucial measure to reduce the susceptibility of animals to microbial infections and consequently to reduce the use of antimicrobials in pig production [28] . The management strategies around weaning should focus on measures that avoid any kind of stress for pigs. These measures include preventing the spread of infection, providing the pigs with good thermal comfort, giving them adapted feed and allowing access to this feed for all pigs. Considerable research has been performed into developing diets for weaners and there is now a range of high quality diets that are readily digested by the early-weaned pig [31] . The main purposes of these diets are to achieve A powerful oral immunogen The proposed immunization procedure required large quantities of F4 [8] Leads to a specific mucosal immune response Antigen degraded by the pH of the stomach and by digestive enzymes

Leads to a significant reduction in fecal excretion of ETEC: F4

Usually required mucosal adjuvant such as Cholera toxin

Breeding of resistant pigs Very effective approach Expensive process [2] Greatly reduces the total amount of antimicrobials used on farms

Reduces the selection pressure Development of other adherence mechanisms high post-weaning feed intakes and minimize duration of post-weaning anorexia and consequently growth retardation. It has been reported that the presence of some ingredients in the feed for weaners, such as soybeans, seems to favor the occurrence of PWD [92] . This could be due to the presence of trypsin inhibitors or antigens inducing a localized immune response [2] . Furthermore, it was shown that soya bean meal (SBM) reduced duodenal specific activities of most intestinal enzymes and increased crypt depth in pigs [93] . Thus, such ingredients should be avoided in feed of early-weaned pigs. In addition, feeds with decreased protein content and the addition of organic acid to reduce gastric pH were found to decrease E. coli colonization and to minimize PWD prevalence [31] . The scientific community increasingly recognizes the importance of communication and awareness among farmers in relation to antimicrobial resistance, as reflected by the growing number of publications in this area in recent years [18, 94] . This suggests that farmers' perceptions, and the factors affecting their behaviour, need to be better understood if effective measures associated responsible and prudent use of antimicrobials are to be implemented successfully.

Moreover, effective diagnostic tools are essential for veterinarians to confirm the bacterial etiology of PWD and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of the identified bacterial strain. The laboratory diagnosis is particularly important in PWD to avoid the inappropriate use of antimicrobials. DNA-based molecular detection methods such multiplex PCR based on the detection of ETEC virulence genes are rapidly becoming part of the routine laboratory diagnosis of PWD, and these genes are used as a biomarkers of ETEC strain [7, 58] .

In several countries, implementation of financial penalties for high antimicrobial users is proposed as a method to reduce antimicrobial usage and pig farmers would receive a financial bonus when they use alternative methods or when they greatly reduce antimicrobial use on their farms [94] . Vaccination seems to be an effective approach to reduce the occurrence of PWD and to reduce infection pressure and increase immunity in the pig population [2] . Several studies conducted in pigs confirm a reduction of antimicrobial usage after vaccination [95] . In fact, vaccination against the porcine proliferative enteropathy caused by Lawsonia intracellularis reduced the need for therapeutic oxytetracycline administration in Danish pigs [96] . Live attenuated and wild type avirulent E. coli vaccines appear to be promising for the control of ETEC infections and live vaccine against ETEC: F4, is now available in Canada and Europe [97] . This vaccine is added to the drinking water and recommended for the vaccination of healthy weaned pigs of 17 days or more. Clinical studies confirmed that administration of this vaccine significantly reduced intestinal colonization by virulent ETEC: F4 and the accumulation of fluid in the intestines after an experimental challenge [98] . The immunity in piglets begins 7 days after oral vaccination, however, since PWD caused by ETEC: F4 occurs shortly, in the first week, after weaning, an immune trough may exist in the first days after weaning during which the pigs are not protected [97] . Thus, the time of the administration of this vaccine should be adjusted. In addition, clinical trials of vaccination against ETEC: F18 has been carried out in pigs. Genetically susceptible pigs were vaccinated orally on three consecutive days, beginning 10 days before weaning with a live F18ac-positive E. coli vaccine [53] . In this study, a significant rise in F18ac-specific serum IgA and a 3 Log CFU decrease in fecal shedding of the F18ac-positive challenge strain was observed compared to the unvaccinated group. However, this vaccine did not induce protective immunity against ETEC: F18. On the other hand, it was shown that a minor subunit of F18 (FedF) alone or genetically fused to F4 FaeG subunit or conjugated to F4 fimbriae induced protective anti-F18 antibodies in pigs [99] . In general, the success of a vaccine against PWD depends largely on the identification of the most prevalent ETEC pathotype present in the farm, resulting in matching of the appropriate protective antigens with the adhesin produced by the ETEC present on the farm, and administering it at the optimal time [7] . For vaccines consisting of live F4 or F18ac-positive E. coli, it is often recommended to vaccinate suckling pigs to obtain a strong mucosal immunity production, IgA, before weaning. However, our knowledge is very limited about the effect of maternal antibodies on the survival of these vaccine strains in the intestine of pigs of this age. Also, there is no cross protection against ETEC strains expressing a different fimbria or toxin. Recently, plantbased vaccines for protection of pigs against ETEC were investigated. A rice-based cholera vaccine expressing the choleratoxin (CT) subunit B (CTB) (MucoRice-CTB) was tested in pigs for protection against LT-ETEC infection [100] . CTB-based vaccines can target not only F4-type but also F18-type ETECs, and this vaccine also induced maternal CTB-specific IgG and IgA in the colostrum and milk of sows after farrowing. CTB-specific antibodies were also secreted into the gut lumen of weaned pigs and reduced intestinal loop fluid accumulation upon ETEC challenge, indicating a protective effect of this vaccine against ETEC diarrhea [100] . However, the cost of these vaccines is very high and, unlike open-air farming, the production of transgenic plants for biotherapeutic use is very demanding. Moreover, the procedures for manufacturing and processing of plant-based pharmaceuticals are not well defined. Thus, a large-scale production of these vaccines not envisaged, at least in the near future. Current progress in the development of subunit vaccines against ETEC associated with diarrhea in humans and animals has been reviewed extensively elsewhere [97, 101] . However, none of these subunit vaccines has been marketed in swine.

The selection of animals genetically resistant to ETEC F4 and/or F18 is considered as a radical solution to eliminate the PWD in a swine herd. However, progress in this area is very limited or even non-existent. Pigs that are resistant to ETEC: F4 and/or F18 do not express intestinal receptors for these fimbrial types [2] . The expression of these receptors is genetically determined and inherited in a dominant way and the loci controlling F4R and F18R expression are located on separate chromosomes. The gene underlying resistance to F4ab/ac ETEC has been assigned to porcine chromosome 13, whereas the F4ad ETEC receptor is located on another chromosome that was not identified [102] . A PCR-RFLP test has been developed to allow genotyping for F4ab/ac ETEC resistance/susceptibility [103] . Three different genotypes were observed and were identified as resistant (RR), susceptible heterozygote (SR) and susceptible homozygote (SS). However, it cannot be predicted if additional types of adhesive fimbriae or new variants of known types will emerge which could bind to yet unidentified receptors and could cause outbreaks of diarrhea and mortality in the nursery [2] . It is difficult to understand the reasons behind the non-exploration of the genetic breeding for ETEC resistant pigs to reduce economic losses associated with PWD and to reduce the use of antimicrobials on farms. It was shown in an early study that F4 susceptible piglets tend to have better growth performance then F4 resistant ones [104] . Also, heterozygous F4R − piglets are not passively protected from infection by ETEC: F4 strains [105] .

In pigs, PWD can be controlled using various preventive strategies without using antimicrobials (Table 3) . Feed supplements such as zinc oxide, organic acids, pre-probiotics, synbiotics, dehydrated porcine plasma, antimicrobial peptides, specific egg yolk and bacteriophages [31, 89, [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] have been used in weanling pigs to enhance growth, feed efficiency and to reduce PWD. Here we give an overview of these feed strategies, focusing on the most used practices showing clinical effectiveness in reducing symptoms of PWD and ETEC attachment to enterocytes.

Zinc oxide: it has been shown that the addition of zinc (Zn) as zinc oxide (ZnO) at the levels of 2400-3000 ppm in pig feed was effective in the reducing of PWD and mortality and in improving growth performance in weaned pigs [111, 112] . However, Amezcua and collaborators [1] reported an important proportion of farms with PWD occurrence using high levels of ZnO. Also, several studies reported an increased proportion of E. coli isolates resistant to tetracycline and sulfonamides in pigs fed with high zinc doses [113, 114] . This may explain why antimicrobial resistance persists even in the absence of antimicrobial exposure [115, 116] . Moreover, the use of high zinc levels in pig feeds has led to heavy metal contamination in the soil, raising environmental concerns [115] . Recently, Bouwhuis et al. [117] reported that organic zinc [zinc methionine (ZnM)] could be used as a substitute for the inorganic zinc (ZnO) in the pig diet. In fact, organic zinc can be supplemented in lower doses (up to 500 mg/kg feed) compared to ZnO [117] . In this study, the inclusion of ZnM resulted in improved faecal scores and the intestinal architecture compared to that observed in pigs supplemented with ZnO.

Organic acids such as citric, fumaric, lactic, propionic, benzoic and formic acids showed beneficial effects in the pig gastrointestinal tract. In fact, the use of organic acids in weaned piglets was associated with a reduction of stomach pH [118] . With this effect, organic acids generate a hostile gastric environment for bacterial survival. Moreover, organic acids promote the conversion of pepsinogen into pepsin in the stomach of pigs, and promote the activity of this enzyme [108] . On the other hand, decreasing the intestinal pH is probably not a primary effect of feeding organic acids in pigs. Indeed, Risley et al. [119] reported a non significant decrease in the pH of the small intestine in 3-week-old weanling pigs fed with a diet supplemented with 1.5% fumaric or citric acid. Addition of organic acids to weaned pig diets improved growth performance and health [31] as well as the local immunity in the jejunum epithelium [120] . It was reported that regardless of the organic acids used in the feed, these compounds reduced the incidence and severity of diarrhea in pigs, and improved the performance of the treated group compared to that of the negative control group [121] .

Prebiotics are selectively fermented components of feed, indigestible by the host animal, that modulate the gut microbiota to benefit host health. Resulting effects include the stimulation of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production and the proliferation of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. [122, 123] . Common prebiotics include inulin and oligosaccharides such as galactooligosaccharides (GOS) and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) [124] . Pigs fed with chito-oligosaccharides (COS) showed better overall intestinal health (based on villi height), improved performance (measured by body weight gain and feed conversion ratio) and higher Lactobacillus counts than those found in control pigs or pigs receiving diets supplemented with chlortetracycline [125] . Also, fermented ingredients, such as non-starch polysaccharide hydrolysis products of soybean meal (SBM) in weaned pig feed, were found to interfere with attachment of ETEC to enterocytes and were beneficial in maintaining fluid balance during ETEC infection [126] . It was shown that the prebiotic β-galactomannan (βGM) inhibited the in vitro adhesion of ETEC on the cell surface of porcine intestinal IPI-2I cells, and decreased the mRNA ETECinduced gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, GM-CSF and chemokines on intestinal IPI-2I cells [127] .

Probiotics such as lactic acid bacteria, Bacillus and yeasts are live microbial feed supplements [122] . Probiotic bacteria have also been shown to produce antimicrobial molecules, such as bacteriocins, and to inhibit the production of bacterial toxins or the adhesion of pathogens to the intestinal mucosa [123] . Several studies demonstrated that pre-treatment with certain probiotics, such as L. rhamnosus, was effective in reducing diarrhea in experimental ETEC: F4 PWD in pigs, possibly via the modulation of the intestinal microbiota, enhancement of intestinal antibody defense, and regulation of production of systemic inflammatory cytokine [128] . Recently, Lane et al. [129] reported that L. acidophilus supplementation (0.2%) in the weaned pig diet resulted in higher Lactobacillus counts and lower E. coli counts, as well as an increase in ADG and the average daily feed intake in supplemented pigs compared to the basal diet pigs. A Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus subtilis spore mixture (BLS-mix) was effective in preventing loss of intestinal epithelial barrier integrity after a challenge with ETEC:

Zinc oxide Inhibition of bacterial adhesion to the intestinal mucosa

Spray dried plasma (SDP) Improved growth performance High cost [111] Reduced incidence and severity of diarrhea Required rigorous control during the preparation process

Reduced the markers of intestinal inflammation Potential source of pathogens?

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) Improved growth performance The pharmacokinetics in vivo is unknown [89, 139] Decreased diarrhea Bacterial resistance

Enhance immune function Cocktails of AMPs might be used to mitigate selection for resistance Specific egg yolk antibodies Improved growth performance High cost [111] Decreased diarrhea Antibodies are sometime not specific against the infecting ETEC strains on farms Maintained intestinal mucosal integrity

Reduced E. coli mucosal adhesion Narrow spectrum of activity [144] Maintained intestinal mucosal integrity Development of bacterial resistance

Decreased diarrhea A combination of phages is needed F4 in experimental PWD [130] . In addition, it was shown that the feeding of pigs with live yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae enhanced their growth and reduced the duration and the severity of PWD caused by ETEC [131] . It has been demonstrated that the administration of a mixture of two probiotics, Pediococcus acidilactici and Saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii, in the feed of challenged weaned pigs reduced ETEC: F4 attachment to the ileal mucosa in comparison with the group treated with chlortetracycline and tiamulin [103] . Synbiotics refers to a combination of probiotic and prebiotic approaches; it is possible that a prebiotic that confers gastrointestinal health benefits could selectively increase the population and/or activity of probiotics in the gut [132] . Synbiotics can be either complementary or synergistic. Complementary synbiotics consist of a probiotic and a prebiotic selected independently to confer benefits to the host. On the other hand, synergistic synbiotics are comprised of a prebiotic chosen specifically for the selected probiotic to potentiate its effect in the gut [133] . It was shown that the combination of raw potato starch and a probiotic had a beneficial effect on pig growth performance and resulted in a reduction of diarrhea and increased microbial diversity in the gut of weaned pigs challenged with an ETEC: F4 strain [134] . Also, Guerra-Ordaz et al. [135] showed that following a challenge of pigs with pathogenic E. coli (O149:K91:H10), administration of a prebiotic oligosaccharide, lactulose, in the feed resulted in improved weight gain, increased lactobacilli and the proportion of butyric acid in the colon, and less inflammation due to a reduction of the pig major acutephase protein (Pig-MAP) in serum. Administration of Lactobacillus plantarum in the feed promoted lactobacilli growth, modulated fermentative activity, reduced inflammation, and improved intestinal mucosa function and showed a tendency to reduce diarrhea. The application of a synbiotic diet resulted in the benefits of both diet regimes, thus being an example of a complementary synbiotic [135] .

Spray dried plasma (SDP) is a protein rich product obtained from the industrial fractionation of blood from healthy animals [106] . It was shown that addition of SDP to the feed improved growth performance, and protects pigs against ETEC: F4 infection by reducing the intestinal expression of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and interleukin-8 and maintaining mucosal integrity, and enhancing specific antibody defense [111] . Spray dried plasma (SDPP) of porcine origin has been pinpointed as a potential source for the coronavirus in a recent epidemic of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) [136] . Thus, spray-dried chicken plasma (SDCP) has been evaluated as a replacement for SDPP in weaned pigs. Indeed, the effect of SDCP on serum biochemistry, intestinal barrier function, immune parameters, and the expression of intestinal development-related genes in piglets was similar to SDPP [137] . Nevertheless, a study has provided evidence that PED virus is inactivated during the SDPP production process [138] .

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small molecules constituting an important part of the innate immune system. They may present antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic, and antiviral activities, and are increasingly of interest as alternatives to classic antibiotics [88] . AMPs such as lactoferrin, cecropin, defensin, plectasin and bacteriocins showed beneficial effects on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, small intestinal morphology and gut microbiota in pigs [89] . Available data on the effect of AMPs on swine health and especially in the control of PWD have been reviewed extensively elsewhere [89, 139] . Antimicrobial lactoferrin peptides are one of the most commonly used AMPs in pig feeds. More recently, it was shown in a murine model of intestinal inflammation that treatment with porcine lactoferrinderived peptide LFP-20 was effective in the prevention of histological damage, the inflammatory response and the disruption of tight junction structure induced by LPS in the intestine [140] . Colicins, a class of bacteriocins produced by E. coli and closely related species, have been shown to inhibit the activities of ETEC: F4 and F18 strains in vitro and in vivo, and improve the growth performance, reduce the incidence of PWD and the expression of the IL-1β and TNF-β genes in ileal tissues of pigs [141] . On the other hand, resistance to AMPs has been observed in vitro in GNB such as E. coli [142] . Thus, the use of AMPs in pig farms needs careful and controlled implementation to limit possible resistance development and cocktails of AMPs might be useful to mitigate selection for resistance [88] .

Specific egg yolk antibodies: The chicken egg yolk is a source of large quantities of relatively inexpensive IgY antibodies [2] . Several studies reported that specific chicken antibodies provide protection against ETEC infections in pigs [111] . Despite the effectiveness of this practice, we have not found in the recent literature (last 5 years) any studies evaluating the use of specific egg yolk antibodies in PWD control. This is probably the consequence of the non-profitability in pig production of this practice, or the lack of protection against ETEC challenge or PWD occurrence, possibly because the antibodies contained in the eggs are not specific against the infected ETEC strains present on the farm [143] .

Bacteriophages are highly species-specific viruses that can infect and kill bacteria. They have been widely evaluated in clinical trials to treat bacterial infections in pigs as an alternative to antibiotics use [144] . Recently, it was reported that dietary supplementation with bacteriophages for the treatment of PWD caused by an ETEC: F4 strain in an experimental model, was effective in reducing rectal temperature, faecal consistency score, E. coli adhesion score in the ileum and caecum, and villous height/crypt depth ratio (VH/CD) in the duodenum and jejunum [145] . However, there are several disadvantages associated with the use of phage therapy in swine. Phages have a narrow spectrum of activity directed against a limited number of bacteria and the possible development of bacterial resistance against phages has to be considered [144] . To overcome the narrow spectrum of activity, some recent studies have reported beneficial effects of a bacteriophage cocktail used in the feed for weanling pigs. This combination resulted in enhanced growth performance and gut health of pigs, although the combination of phages with probiotics did not show any additional effect [109] . Some authors have considered that the development of phage-resistant bacteria could be positive for the host [146] . In fact, resistance to phages can reduce the fitness of the bacteria and could thereby impair their competitive capacity and consequently their ability to colonize the intestinal mucosa of the host [146] .

Others: Several studies have documented a significant improvement of weight gain, and feed conversion, as well as the reduction of the incidence, severity and duration of diarrhea in weaned pigs fed diets supplemented with substances such as: exogenous enzymes [147] , milk products [148] , clay minerals [149] , and medicinal plants [150] . Although many peer-reviewed studies discussing these substances are available in the scientific literature, most of the clinical studies were performed in experimental conditions. More research is needed to evaluate the potential effectiveness of these substances under field conditions for the control of PWD in pigs.

Several studies have been carried out in experimental conditions to assess the effectiveness of alternatives to colistin for the control of PWD in pigs (Table 4 ). Here, we give an overview of studies published in 2015 or 2016.

Several recent experimental studies have now shown that some alternatives (Table 4 ) resulted in similar or superior clinical outcomes compared to colistin for improving growth performance and intestinal integrity and in reducing of incidence of diarrhea in weaned pigs. In fact, no difference was observed in growth performance of weaned pigs supplemented with hop β-acids (120, 240, or 360 mg/kg) or colistin (40 mg/kg) during a trial period of 35 days [151] . Moreover, the supplementation of weaned pigs with two Macrocephala flavored powder (3000 mg/kg) increased significantly villus height in the duodenum and jejunum compared to that observed in colistin (300 mg/kg) supplemented pigs [152] . However, these studies (Table 4 ), were conducted in experimental conditions and in most cases in healthy weaned pigs. Thus, further research is needed to demonstrate the stability and the efficacy of such alternatives (probiotics, AMPs, medicinal plants) in field conditions as well as the safety of these substances in animals and for consumers. Also, work is needed to optimize the doses of these substances to incorporate in the feed to ensure their effectiveness in PWD control. The financial cost and the ease of administration of such alternatives are the other important criteria that should be taken into consideration in pig production.

A long and growing list of compounds have been tested for their ability to replace colistin or other antibiotics for the control of PWD in pigs. However, it is difficult to identify a single "ideal" solution for PWD management. Also, as was discussed above, PWD is a multifactorial disease and the exact overall etiology has not yet been fully elucidated, making it difficult to choose suitable alternatives. Moreover, the most of these alternatives produce inconsistent results regarding their effectiveness in field conditions [107] . Oral administration of specificantibody-containing egg yolk, or SDP to weaned piglets showed in some cases no protection against ETEC strains or PWD outcomes, likely because the contained antibodies were not specific against the infecting ETEC strains present on the farm [2] . The composition of plant extracts, organic acids and probiotics is complex and knowledge regarding their mechanisms of action is poor, resulting in variable results and safety risks [87] . Synergy mechanisms of probiotics and prebiotics are not very well known nor well studied [133] . Although AMPs and bacteriophages helped in the treatment of PWD, the bacterial resistance risk, the high cost and the narrow antibacterial spectrum of these alternatives reduce their practical use on farms [88] . Vaccination is one of the most promising strategies for the control of PWD in pigs both in terms of preventive ability and cost-effectiveness [97] . The control of production parameters (temperature, ventilation, density, sanitation, biosafety, improvement of feed quality) are crucial factors for the control of PWD and the reduction of the use of antimicrobials during the post-weaning period [28] . However, the improvement of farm conditions and management requires investment and awareness of pig farmers. Furthermore, the use of regular diagnostic testing is crucial to ensure an appropriate choice of the antimicrobial and to monitor its effectiveness on farms. Thus, efforts to improve microbiological laboratory detection methods are of paramount importance to help the veterinarian to act rapidly at an early stage of the disease [153] .

For the management of PWD in different stages of its evolution, we propose a comprehensive approach that involves producers, the nutrition industry, veterinarians, the diagnostic laboratory, and researchers (Fig. 3) . The absence of a well-identified etiology of PWD and of an effective alternative to antimicrobials requires a close collaboration between the different stakeholders to reduce antibiotic resistance and economic losses caused by this disease in swine.

Despite the progress that has been observed in modern pig farms during the last decade to prevent infectious diseases and improve global animal health, PWD remains a problem that causes significant economic losses in pig production. Antibiotics have contributed significantly to mitigate the economic losses caused by infectious diseases and particularly PWD in swine. However, increasing bacterial resistance leading to therapeutic failures on farms as well as the greater vigilance of consumers regarding antimicrobial residues, have resulted in more intensive research and a large number of clinical trials for the development of alternatives to antimicrobials. Thus, several alternatives have been developed, some of which have been commercialized for the management of PWD in pigs. However, the effectiveness of these news therapies has been variable from one farm to another due to the management of livestock and farm conditions. Although

Control of housing conditions and vaccination are the most promising strategies for the prevention of PWD in pigs and for reducing of the overall use of antimicrobials on farms. However, the establishment and the effectiveness of these strategies depend on the involvement of all stakeholders in pig farming. Judicious use of antimicrobials in pigs and continued development of alternatives to antimicrobials and colistin remains a priority to ensure a long-term sustainable development in pigs. 

A G1-lineage H9N2 virus with oviduct tropism causes chronic pathological changes in the infundibulum and a long-lasting drop in egg production

Since 1997, G1-lineage H9N2 avian influenza viruses have been circulating in Asia and later on in the Middle East, and they have been associated to mild respiratory disease, drops in egg production and moderate mortality in chickens, in particular in the presence of concurrent infections. In this study, we investigated the importance of the G1-lineage H9N2 A/chicken/Israel/1163/2011 virus as a primary pathogen in layers, analyzing its tropism and binding affinity for the oviduct tissues, and investigating the long-term impact on egg production. Besides causing a mild respiratory infection, the virus replicated in the oviduct of 60% of the hens causing different degrees of salpingitis throughout the organ, in particular at the level of the infundibulum, where the detection of the virus was associated with severe heterophilic infiltrate, and necrosis of the epithelium. Binding affinity assays confirmed that the infundibulum was the most receptive region of the oviduct. The drop in egg production was at its peek at 2 weeks post-infection (pi) (60% decrease) and continued up to 80 days pi (35% decrease). On day 80 pi, non-laying birds showed egg yolk peritonitis, and histopathological analyses described profound alteration of the infundibulum architecture, duct ectasia and thinning of the epithelium, while the rest of the oviduct and ovary appeared normal. Our results show that this H9N2 virus is a primary pathogen in layer hens, and that its replication in the infundibulum is responsible for acute and chronic lesions that limits the effective functionality of the oviduct, compromising the commercial life of birds.

Avian influenza viruses (AIV) of the H5, H7 and H9 subtypes represent an enormous commercial burden for the poultry sector, at a global level. Commercial, as well as political and sanitary issues related to the circulation of AIV, prompted policymakers and intergovernmental health organizations to set subtype and pathotype-specific international standards to better control H5 and H7 outbreaks, as these subtypes might cause epidemics of huge proportions, in different poultry species [1] . On the other hand, AIV of the H9N2 subtype are not subject to specific international control measures, as they are considered of low-pathogenicity for poultry and their subtype has never mutated to the highly pathogenic form.

Genetically, distinct H9N2 lineages have been described, the G1 being probably the most widespread. In fact, H9N2 viruses of the G1 lineage emerged in Hong Kong in 1997 [2] , and steadily spread to the rest of Asia, reaching the Middle East [3] and North Africa [4] [5] [6] [7] , by the year 2000 and 2006, respectively. In 2016, the virus severely affected Morocco and, for the first time, was reported in sub-Sahara Africa, being reported in Burkina Faso, in West Africa [8] . In many of these regions, the virus has become an endemic presence notwithstanding the implementation of vaccination, increased biosafety and surveillance measures, and is frequently associated with moderate-to-high mortality in broilers and Open Access *Correspondence: fbonfante@izsvenezie.it 1 Division of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie, Viale dell'Università, 10, 35020 Legnaro, Italy Full list of author information is available at the end of the article long-lasting drops in egg production in layers and breeders [4, 5, 9] .

Several experimental studies have tried to reproduce the clinical presentations observed in the field, but mortality and severe respiratory signs were rarely observed unless the infection was artificially coupled with secondary pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus paragallinarum, Chlamydia psittaci, Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale and live infectious bronchitis virus vaccine [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] or in the presence of an immunocompromised flock [16] . In our opinion, these data together with the lack of ad hoc restrictive control measures and in-depth diagnostic analyses during outbreaks, have somehow mitigated the perception of H9N2 viruses as primary pathogens of poultry.

Although evidence from the field clearly indicates the ability of H9N2 viruses to induce pathology at the level of the oviduct [17] , only few studies have investigated the tropism of these agents for this organ, in a controlled experimental setting [18] [19] [20] [21] . Wang et al. proved in fact, that a H9N2 virus of the Y280 lineage isolated in the Shangxii province in 2011, could replicate at high titers in the oviduct, trigger apoptosis and cause a decrease in the number of laid eggs in the first week post infection and a reduction in egg-shell thickness [18, 20] .

Inspired by this work, we decided to study the acute and chronic impact of a G1-lineage H9N2 virus on the performance of Hy-Line Brown hens at the peak of lay, to fully elucidate the etiology and pathogenesis of the disease in commercial layers.

For this study, 70 Hy-Line Brown hens were bought from a local farm at the peak of lay (28 weeks of age) and housed in negative, high efficiency particulate air filtered poultry isolators, at the facilities of the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie. At the farm, birds were vaccinated against infectious bronchitis, Newcastle disease, infectious laryngotracheitis, Salmonella enteritidis, Marek's disease, Infectious bursal disease, avian encephalomyelitis, avian metapneumovirus, coccidiosis, egg drop syndrome and fowlpox. Birds received feed and water ad libitum. Animal experiment procedures were conducted in strict accordance with the Decree of the Ministry of Health n. 26 of 4 March 2014 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes, implementing Directive 2010/63/EU, and approved by the Institute's Ethics Committee (n. 5/2014). Before the experiments, the birds were given a 4-weeks period to ensure acclimatization to the isolators, and the normalization of laying performances. Eggs were collected throughout the study, three times a day. Birds were screened for the presence of antibodies against type A Influenza virus nucleoprotein by using a commercial ELISA test (ID Vet, Montpellier, France) and resulted negative.

A low pathogenicity AI (LPAI) virus of the H9N2 subtype belonging to the G1 lineage [22] , A/chicken/ Israel/1163/2011 was isolated at the Kimron Veterinary Institute from swabs collected during surveillance activities, in Israel [23] . A viral stock was produced by inoculating 9-to-11-day-old embryonated specific pathogen free (SPF) hen's eggs, via the allantoic cavity and was subsequently titrated according to the Reed and Muench method [24] , to determine the embryo infectious dose 50% (EID 50 ). The stock was screened to exclude the presence of bacterial agents and common viruses of poultry as previously described [25] . The low pathogenicity of the virus had already been confirmed in a previous experimental study by calculating the intravenous pathogenicity index [26] that resulted to be 0. The nucleotide sequence of the hemagglutinin gene was made available in the GenBank database under the Accession Number JQ973659 by Davidson et al. [23] . The virus stock used in this studies had a history of three passages in embryonated chicken eggs.

Birds were challenged via the oro-nasal route with a dose of 10 6 EID 50 /0.1 mL of virus. All experimental infections were carried out on birds that were lightly sedated, injecting intramuscularly 150 µL of tiletamine and zolazepam, to prevent that the challenge inoculum was either sucked in or sprayed out by the animal. Negative control groups were sham infected reproducing the challenge protocol of sedation but administering 100 µL of negative allantoic fluid.

For the collection of organs birds were sedated with 300 µL of tiletamine and zolazepam via the intramuscular route and humanely killed via an intravenous administration of 200 µL of tetracaine.

In all of the experiments, birds were monitored twice a day to record the manifestation of clinical signs.

In this experiment, 10 layers were challenged in the H9-group, and 10 birds served as negative controls, in the K-group. In this study, birds were only swabbed in the trachea once, on day 4 pi to ensure infection was ongoing. We kept handling to a minimum, to avoid disturbance of the animals and the interference of confounding factors in the assessment of laying performances. Eggs were collected, counted and evaluated in terms of shape, color and shell thickness using an analog micrometer with a sensitivity of 0.01 mm (Baxlo ® Precision, Spain). All of the birds were euthanized on day 80 pi to collect the oviduct and evaluate the histological architecture of the organ.

In this experiment, 28 layers were challenged in the H9-group, and 12 birds served as negative controls, in the K-group. On days 4, 6, 10 and 18 pi, seven and three birds were randomly selected and euthanized in the H9 and K groups, respectively. Each of the seven birds in the H9-group, was necropsied and the oviducts were collected for virological, bacteriological and histological analyses, while for 4/7 of these animals a more comprehensive set of tissues was analyzed including, lungs, duodenum, cecal tonsils, spleen, kidney and brain, to evaluate the tissue tropism of the challenge virus. All of the birds in this experiment were sampled for tracheal swabs on day 4 pi, to confirm that the challenge had been followed by an infection. To evaluate the viral shedding, we randomly selected nine animals in this group and collected tracheal and cloacal swabs on day 2, 4 and 6 pi.

In this experiment, 10 birds were challenged to evaluate whether viremia played a role in the spread of the virus to extra-respiratory and extra-digestive tissues. Birds were swabbed in the trachea on day 2 pi, to ensure infection was ongoing. On days 2 and 3 pi, five birds were sedated with 300 µL of tiletamine and zolazepam via the intramuscular route and euthanized by exsanguination, via cardiac puncture to collect as much blood as possible and test both blood cells and plasma for the presence of virus RNA.

Organ samples were weighed and homogenized, in a solution of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and antibiotic-antimycotic (penicillin, streptomycin and amphotericin B). Homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 10 000 g, for 10 min at 4 °C, and stored at −80 °C.

We collected blood at a 1:1 ratio with Alsever's solution to prevent coagulation and clarified 50 mL by centrifugation at 2000 g for 30 min, at 4 °C to collect pelleted blood cells. Subsequently, we centrifuged the supernatant at 27 000 g for 2 h at 4 °C, and irrespective of the presence of a visible pellet, the bottom of the tube was washed with 1 mL of PBS, and the collected fluid was stored at −80 °C.

Tracheal and cloacal swabs were eluted into 0.5 mL and 1 mL, respectively of PBS containing antibiotics. Viral RNA was extracted from 100 mL of either clarified-andultracentrifuged blood, tissue homogenates or pelleted blood cells, using the commercial NucleoSpinRNA kit (Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany) for manual extraction and from 50 µL of PBS containing a swab suspension, using the Ambion MagMax-96 AI-ND Viral RNA Isolation kit for the automatic extractor.

AIV quantitative real time RT-PCR (qRRT-PCR) was performed using the published probe and primers targeting the avian gene M from Spackman et al. [27] .

For qRRT-PCR assays of blood and organs, a standard curve was generated using triplicates of ten-fold serial dilutions of in vitro transcribed RNA to obtain the quantification of the samples expressed in copies/ µL. The in vitro transcribed RNA was generated using the MEGAscript T7 transcription Kit (Ambion ® , Austin, USA) with the H7N1 subtype A/ostrich/Italy/984/2000 strain as a template.

The AIV standard curve was carried out for each run together with the samples. All tests were performed on the Bio-Rad CFX96 real-time PCR system and analyzed using the Bio-Rad software.

The sensitivity of the method, defined by the lowest concentration of the virus detected in all of the replicates in one RRT-PCR assay, was 10 4.1 copies/µL for in vitro transcribed RNA.

All of the quantitative results were calculated as copies/µL equivalents and then normalized as copies/0.1 g of organic material, as all of the samples were weighed before processing.

Titration of infectivity was carried out by a standard tissue culture infectious dose 50% (TCID 50 ) assay using MDCK cells. The presence of viral infection was determined at 72 h pi, by optical assessment of cytopathic effects coupled with a hemagglutination assay (HA). The titer was determined by the Reed and Muench method [24] . The limit of detection was of 20 TCID 50 /0.1 g of tissue.

As both primary and secondary bacterial colonization of the oviduct can occur in birds contributing to abnormal eggs in shape, color and size, we carried out bacteriological examination on oviduct specimens that had resulted positive for the presence of influenza A virus by RRT-PCR to investigate the presence of relevant bacteria (e.g. E. coli, Gallibacterium spp., Enterococcus spp., Streptococccus spp., Pseudomonas spp.). Moreover, specific PCRs for Mycoplasma synoviae and galllisepticum were performed from oviducts in order to rule out the onset of abnormal eggs due to mycoplasma infection.

Briefly, oviduct swabs were aseptically collected from each bird and the site of sampling was the same in all oviducts, thus a sterile cotton swab was scrubbed for 5 s on the oviductal mucosa between the infundibulum and magnum portions. Then, swabs were aseptically removed from the tissues and immediately put into an Amies transport medium for bacteria isolation (Copan Innovation, Brescia, Italy), thus these biological specimens were sent to the laboratory for standard microbiology examinations. Swabs were promptly inoculated into solid and liquid media for bacteria isolation such as Blood Agar plates, Mac Conckey plates, BEA plates (Bile Esculin Agar) and heart infusion broth (HIB) and cultivated at 37 °C under 5% CO 2 environment for 24 h. After incubation, plates were checked for visible bacteria growth and in case of presence of colonies further standard bacteriological analyses were carried out for bacterial identification. On the contrary, if no colonies were present on agar surface and the HIB broth presented turbidity, some drops of the broth cultures were inoculated in new and sterile Blood Agar, Mac Conckey and BEA plates, which were incubated in the same physical conditions for further 24 h. Swabs for Mycoplasma spp. detection were submitted for DNA extraction by MagVetTM Universal isolation kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and Microlab STARlet (Hamilton Robotics, Reno, NV, USA); M. synoviae was investigated through a Real Time PCR targeting the 16S-23S gene as described by Raviv and Kleven [28] with slight modifications. The end-point PCR for M. gallisepticum, targeting the MGC2 gene, was performed as described by Garcia et al. [29] with slight modifications.

Moreover, since IBV and NDV viruses can invade the oviduct and cause salpingitis in avian species, we carried out differential virological examinations on the oviductal swabs.

Swabs were processed for the extraction of RNA as described in the previous section. We performed a RRT-PCR targeting the 5′-untranslated region of the IBV genome according to Callison et al. [30] and a RRT-PCR targeting the NDV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene as previously reported [26] .

Organ samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 48 h, routinely processed for histology and 4-μm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). The infundibulum, magnum and uterus were examined for the presence of: (a) heterophilic infiltrate; (b) lymphocytic and plasmacytic infiltrate; (c) the presence of hemorrhage and/or edema; (d) necrosis; (e) the presence of hemorrhage and/or cell debris within the lumen. For each of these pathological features, a score was given as follows: 0 absence of the feature, 1 mild, 2 moderate, 3 severe. For each section scores were averaged to obtain a mean histopathology score. Mean scores were averaged for each oviduct section and sampling time.

H9N2 virus qRRT-PCR positive samples were tested by IHC and a score was assigned to each section as follows: 0 no staining, 1 small clusters of positive cells, 2 multiple accumulations of positive cells and 3 extensive staining. IHC was performed on 3-µm sections, using an automated immunostainer. For each oviduct section and sampling time scores were averaged. The antigen retrieval was performed using the commercial ready to use solution Protease 2 (Roche, Germany), at 36 °C, for 12 min. The slides were incubated with the monoclonal antibody clone 1331 (Biodesign, USA) targeting the nucleoprotein of influenza type A viruses applied at 1:1500 dilution, for 80 min at room temperature. An ultraView Universal DAB Detection Kit (Roche, Germany) was used as detection system. A positive control consisting of a lung of an Influenza A positive chicken and a negative control consisting of a kidney of an Influenza A negative chicken were included in each run. All of the tested tissues were also incubated with the negative control antibody MG2a-53 (ab18415, Abcam) matching the primary antibody species and isotype.

H9N2 virus concentration and purification were carried out according to Hutchinson and Fodor [31] .

Inactivation and labelling of the challenge virus were done according to van Riel et al. [32] . Briefly, inactivation was achieved by dialysis against 0.1% formalin for 3 days. After inactivation, the virus was dialyzed against PBS. We labelled the inactivated virus through an incubation of 1 h at room temperature with a 1:1 (v/v) 0.5 mol/L bicarbonate buffer solution (pH 9.5) containing 0.1 mg/mL of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The virus was dialyzed in PBS to release unbound FITC, using Pur-A-Lyzer tubes (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), for 6 h.

Birds from negative control groups were selected as donors of tissues to study the binding preference of the challenge virus. The virus histochemistry (VHC) technique was performed on the infundibulum, magnum, isthmus and uterus according to the protocol developed by van Riel et al. [32] . Briefly, 3-µm sections were deparaffinized and hydrated with graded alcohols. Incubation with the labelled virus was carried out overnight, at 4 °C with either 5, 50 or 100 hemagglutinin units (HAU). To visualize the bound virus, slides were incubated with a monoclonal antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase targeting the FITC molecule labelling the virus. The signal was amplified with a tyramide signal amplification system (Perkin Elmer, MA, USA). Peroxidase was revealed with 3-amino-9-ethyl-carbazole (AEC) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Tissues were counterstained with hematoxylin and embedded in glycerol.

The non-parametric Mann Whitney test was used to compare the virus load of tracheal and cloacal swabs, and to establish whether virus loads in the oviducts were significantly different from those reported in the rest of the organs. Oviposition, eggshell thickness, and numbers of misshaped and discoloured eggs were expressed as daily means for each group. We compared the weekly means among groups using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signedranks test, a two-tailed P value. Statistical analyses were carried out using the GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Prism, GraphPad Software, La Jolla CA, USA) and the significance level was set at P < 0.05.

Before the challenge, all of the animals looked healthy and did not display egg-eating behavior. During the 4 weeks of adaptation, we recorded the number, shape, color and shell thickness of eggs, and all parameters resulted to be within the normal ranges of the commercial line.

All of the challenged birds shed viral RNA via the tracheal route on day 4 pi and showed signs of mild depression, ruffled feathers and a transitory arched posture, while we recorded conjunctivitis in approximately onethird of the layers. Birds started showing signs of the disease on day 3 pi and gradually recovered by day 6-7 pi. To compare egg production between groups on a weekly basis, daily values were averaged ( Figure 1 ) and are here expressed as laying rates (%), considering a production of 10 eggs/10 hens/day as a hypothetical value of 100%. Before the infection, all of the layers in the H9 and K groups laid eggs scoring a mean production of 93.0% and 95.0%, respectively and we did not observe any statistical difference between the two groups.

In the H9-group, laying rates decreased to 65.7% and 44.3% 1 and 2 weeks after the challenge, respectively, while from week 3-9 pi values plateaued in the range of 62.8-70.0%. After the sham infection, birds in the control group recorded laying performances in the range of 95.7-98.5%. Statistical analyses indicate that the difference in egg production between the two groups was significant (P < 0.05) for 9 weeks after the challenge.

Occasionally, we observed discoloration and changes in the shape of eggs in the H9-group, but we did not find these features to be statistically different when compared with the K-group. The individual shell thickness fluctuated widely within and between groups, irrespective of the time of challenge. We found no statistical evidence that the replication of the virus related to a change in the thickness of the shell.

In 56%, 78% and 60% of the birds the cloacal swabs resulted positive on days 2, 4 and 6 pi, respectively (Additional file 1), while all of the birds shed virus RNA via the trachea at each sampling time. We compared the average Ct values of cloacal and tracheal swabs and observed that the virus load in the trachea was significantly higher than in the cloaca, on days 2 and 4 pi.

We evaluated the viral colonization of organs carrying out three complementary assays, namely the detection of the virus M gene by qRRT-PCR, isolation and titration of the virus in MDCK cells by TCID 50 and the detection of the virus NP protein by IHC.

The qRRT-PCR detected virus RNA in all of the organs that are commonly assumed to be the target of LPAI viruses, namely the duodenum, the cecal tonsil or the lungs in 83% of the birds, throughout the study. Moreover, at least one of the four sections of the oviduct was positive by qRRT-PCR in 71%, 57% and 14% of the layers on days 4, 6 and 10 pi, respectively (Table 1) .

Let aside the anatomical district of the oviduct, we detected the virus RNA in organs beyond the digestive and respiratory tracts, namely in the kidney, spleen and brain of 25% of the layers on day 4 pi, and in the kidneys and spleens of 50% of the birds on day 6 pi.

On day 10 pi, one out of four birds had virus RNA in the spleen (Figure 2) . None of the organs collected on day 18 pi was positive by qRRT-PCR. Figure 1 Laying performance of challenged and control birds in experiment 1. Eggs were collected throughout the experiment, three times a day, keeping handling of animals to the minimum, in order to avoid the occurrence of stressful events. We compared the egg production between challenged and control birds on a weekly basis, adopting the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks on daily mean values for each group. Significance level was set at P < 0.05. Data are shown here as mean ± standard deviations. The differences in the weekly egg production between the two groups were significant (P < 0.05) for 9 weeks after the challenge.

qRRT-PCR positive samples were further titrated to evaluate the infectivity of the virus. On days 4 and 6 pi, we recorded positive TCID 50 values in the oviduct of 43% of the birds, while the organs of the respiratory and digestive tracts were positive in 50% and 25% of the birds respectively, only on day 4 pi (Table 1 and Figure 2) . We did not observe cytopathic effects culturing kidney, brain and spleen samples.

Statistical analyses did not describe significant differences in virus load expressed as either genomic copies or TCID 50 among the different organs.

IHC analyses revealed the presence of the NP protein only in the oviduct, while the rest of the organs were negative (Figure 3) .

Colonization of the different sections of the oviduct was investigated comparing overall RRT-PCR positivity, TCID 50 values, virus loads and IHC scores. The infundibulum resulted positive by RRT-PCR in a higher number of birds on days 4 and 6 pi ( Table 2) , while virus load (Additional file 2) and TCID 50 values did not differ significantly among the oviduct sections.

The comparison of IHC scores among the different sections of the oviduct identified the infundibulum as the section recording the highest values (Table 2) . IHC positivity was mostly limited to the nuclei and cytoplasm of the mucosal epithelia, even though we observed a specific and intense staining at the level of the serosal surface of the oviduct in 2/7 and 1/7 birds, on days 4 and 6, respectively.

All of the birds shed virus RNA at the level of the trachea on day 2 pi, confirming that the challenge caused an infection. We did not detect virus RNA in either the clarified-and-ultracentrifuged plasma or the pelleted blood cells.

Post-mortem examinations and histological analyses were performed on all of the euthanized birds in experiments 1 and 2. Results from experiment 2 will be first presented, to mirror the progression of the disease through time.

None of the birds from the control group showed significant macroscopic changes in any of the examined organs. Irrespective of the sampling time, we did not record any lesion in the lungs, kidneys, and brains of birds in the H9-group, while the spleens appeared slightly enlarged in all of the subjects, on days 4 and 6 pi.

Histological analyses indicated a mild-to-moderate congestion of the spleens and lungs collected on day 4, 6 and 10 pi, while the kidneys and brains appeared normal.

At the examination of the digestive tract, we observed the presence of fibrin and a yellowish exudate on the peritoneum of 4/7 and 5/7 of the birds, on days 4 and 6 pi, respectively.

Histological examinations described a mild superficial enteritis and a diffuse peritonitis with heterophilic and lymphoplasmacytic infiltration in the serosa of the duodenum of 2/4 subjects, on day 4 pi. Similarly, the cecal tonsils of these birds had a focal infiltrate of lymphoplasmacytic cells in the serosa. On day 6 pi, in 4/4 of the birds we recorded at the level of the duodenum a diffuse catarrho-erosive enteritis with a mild to moderate lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the lamina propria, and in two of these animals we also observed a diffuse granulomatous peritonitis.

On days 10 and 18 pi, 2/7 and 3/7 of the birds respectively had yolk material and fibrin clots on the serosal surface of the organs in the abdomen, in association with a chronic granulomatous peritonitis at the level of the cecal tonsils.

The subjects with fibrin on the peritoneum had also oviducts with oedematous thickened walls, in which we found defective small eggs, abundant mucus, fibrin clots and purulent exudate, from day 4 up to day 10 pi (Figure 4 ).

Histological examination of the oviducts on day 4 pi indicated that in 2/7 of the animals, focal to multifocal erosion of the epithelium and a diffuse mild infiltrate of heterophils and macrophages were present in the mucosa of the infundibulum and in the serosa of the magnum. In one of these two animals, focal ulcerations of the mucosa were also described. On day 6 pi, in 3/7 birds, severe diffuse necrosis involving the full width of the tonaca mucosa, associated with edema and a granulomatous process were recorded at the level of the infundibulum ( Figure 5 ), and in one of these subjects the lesions extended to the magnum and isthmus. In the other two subjects, the magnum, isthmus and uterus appeared normal. Ten days from challenge, 1/7 of the birds showed diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the lamina propria, mild fibrosis and multifocal ectasia of the glands; in 4/7 of the birds a mild heterophilic and lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the mucosa of the infundibulum was observed, and in two of these birds, a similar picture was observed at the level of the magnum, while the isthmus and uterus appeared normal. On day 18 pi, 3/7 of the birds had a diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltration in the mucosa of the infundibulum, with follicular organization, diffuse ectasia of the glands and interstitial fibrosis of the lamina propria. The histopathology score assigned to the infundibulum, magnum and uterus indicates the infundibulum as the most affected section of the oviduct from 4 to 10 days pi ( Table 2) .

Throughout the study, ovaries were productive as multiple follicles were visible during necropsies.

Seven weeks after the challenge, given the chronic reduction in the number of laid eggs, we divided nine of the ten birds of the H9-group into nine additional isolators, to monitor the laying performances on an individual basis and relate it to the pathological and histopathological data. The separation of the layers allowed the identification of 3/10 non-laying birds, over a longer period of 4 weeks. On week 11 pi we euthanized and necropsied all of the birds and we observed egg yolk peritonitis in the three birds in which laying had stopped. Abundant yolk material filled the abdomen and the serosa appeared thickened and characterized by a strong yellow pigmentation. In these birds, the ovary had multiple follicles at different stages of maturation, indicating a normal function of the organ, and the oviduct appeared to be macroscopically normal. The histological examination of the oviducts highlighted that in the three birds with egg yolk peritonitis, the infundibulum architecture was altered by the extensive presence of fibrosis, cystic glands and dysplasia of the mucosa; hyperplastic lymphocytic follicles and a diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate were also evident. The rest of the oviduct had no lesion ( Figure 5 ; Table 3 ). We did not record any pathological aspect in the remaining animals, in which egg production had returned to normality.

To rule out the possibility that other microbiological agents played a role in the pathogenesis of the disease we carried out bacteriology examination, PCRs for M. synoviae and gallisepticumas well as virological analyses on oviductal swabs collected in experiment 2.

No bacterial growth was detected in the oviduct swabs of birds sampled on 4, 6 and 10 days pi, except for one subject on day 4 pi, in which we recorded the presence of few colony forming units (cfu) of E. coli and a low load of Gallibacterium anatis. Mycoplasma synoviae and M. gallisepticum were investigated through PCRs and all oviduct samples resulted negative for mycoplasmas. The presence of IBV and NDV virus RNA in the oviducts was ruled out, as all of the swabs were negative by means of RRT-PCR.

The incubation of the labelled H9N2 virus with the four oviduct sections resulted in a heterogeneous binding profile.

At the level of the infundibulum, the virus attached abundantly and with high specificity to the cilia of the epithelial cells lining the fimbriae (Figure 6 ). In the magnum, virus binding occurred at the level of the ciliated epithelium, and although positivity was highly specific, staining intensity was lower than the one recorded in the infundibulum. The isthmus showed no attachment of the virus to the epithelial cells while staining localized to granules within secretory glands in the lamina propria. The uterus showed a highly specific attachment of the virus to the cytoplasm of epithelial goblet cells.

Throughout the entire oviduct, the outer serosa was specifically and abundantly positive.

To ensure that the binding profile was not biased by the amount of virus used for the incubation step, three doses of 5, 50 and 100 HAU were used. The specificity of the staining was the same from 5 to 100 HAU in the infundibulum and magnum, while non-specific staining was slightly increased at the level of the isthmus and uterus (Additional file 3). Nevertheless, irrespective of the amount of virus used, positivity at the level of the epithelia was maintained.

In this study, we modelled a G1-lineage LPAI H9N2 infection in commercial layers, in order to reproduce and investigate the long-term drop in egg production frequently observed in the field.

Besides the expected self-limiting mild respiratory disease observed in each of the challenged birds, the H9N2 virus spread beyond the respiratory and digestive tracts and, in the absence of bacterial infections, robustly replicated in the oviduct of 62% of the hens Figure 5 Representative histological pictures of the infundibulum, magnum and uterus before, during and after the infection. A-I All pictures were taken using a 10× objective from 4-μm sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin. B During the acute phase of infection (4-10 days pi), replication of the virus in the infundibulum was associated with the occurrence of severe necrosis, edema and granulomatous processes in the mucosa of the organ. C In the chronic phase of the disease (70-80 days pi), birds with egg yolk peritonitis showed a profound alteration of the infundibulum architecture due to the presence of ectatic glands (asterisk), hyperplastic lymphocytic aggregates (arrows) and thinning of the mucosa. E, H Lesions in the magnum and uterus were rarely observed during the acute phase of the infection and were limited to heterophilic necrosis and edema (arrow heads), respectively. F, I A full restoration of the tissue integrity was observed for the magnum and uterus in all subjects, after 70-80 days from infection.

during the first 4-6 days pi. In these birds, we noticed that the ovaries were productive, but in the lumen of the oviducts, there were abortive, defective eggs, mucous and fibrinous clots. In particular, according to both virological and histopathological data, the most affected section was the infundibulum, and in 29% of the birds in the first 4-6 days pi, the mucosal epithelium was extensively ulcerated and immunohistochemistry revealed diffuse positivity in the remaining epithelial cells. On the other hand, despite the evidence of viral replication in the remaining parts of the oviduct, the degree of inflammation was generally lower in the magnum, and practically absent at the level of the uterus. Interestingly, the proportion of animals with an H9N2 infection in the oviduct (62%) closely translated into a proportional drop in egg production during the first 2 weeks post infection, as the average number of laid eggs per day decreased from approximately 10.00 to 4.43 eggs/group, suggesting that the acute and subacute inflammation of the organ, in particular at the level of infundibulum, impaired the oviposition in each of the infected hens.

From 2 weeks up to 80 days pi, the number of eggs increased but reverted to only 65% of the pre-infection average production. Interestingly, the 3/10 layers that did not lay eggs 11 weeks pi had egg yolk material in the abdomen and normal ovaries with multiple follicles. Histological examinations linked the presence of yolk to a severe distortion of the architecture of the infundibulum, where we recorded thinning of the mucosa, diffuse presence of reactive plasmacytic aggregates and the atypical presence of ectatic glands in the lamina propria. Although we could not examine the birds beyond the eleventh week post-infection and throughout their entire commercial life, we reckon that the histological impediment of the infundibulum had become a chronic condition that could have permanently undermined the ability of this tissue to actively capture ova and convey them to the magnum. On the other hand, the rest of the birds completely recovered from the infection, showing no chronic lesion throughout the oviduct.

In light of these data, we speculate that the proportion of birds with severe histopathological changes in the mucosa of the infundibulum (29%) on days 4 and 6 pi closely related to the proportion of hens with chronic lesions (30%) on days 18 and 80 pi, suggesting a causal link between the two pathological processes.

Unfortunately, in our study we did not test the ovaries for virological and histopathological analyses, hence we missed important information that might have completed the pathogenetic picture. For this reason, we should not exclude that the drop in egg production, in particular during the acute phase of the disease, could have also been caused by a viral oophoritis.

The observed acute and chronic drops in egg production correlate with reports in the literature, in which acute declines range from 30 to 80% and chronic ones, although less frequently described, range from 10 to 25% [4, 18, [33] [34] [35] . In particular, in Morocco and in the Middle East, G1 virus infections have been associated with chronic declines up to 11-14 weeks after the beginning of the outbreaks [4, 17] .

In the field, egg peritonitis is often considered of multifactorial etiology and one of the most important causes of mortality in layers and breeders [36] . Overfeeding, stress, genetics and improper lighting may all determine the occurrence of this syndrome, but in some cases, single factors such as viral infections of the reproductive tract (e.g. infectious bronchitis, Newcastle disease, HPAI viruses) can trigger the disease regardless of other managerial issues [37] . If bacterial agents as E. coli gain access to the peritoneum, either via reverse peristalsis along the oviduct or crossing of the intestinal barrier [38] , the peritonitis becomes septic and more likely to bring the animal to a severe pathological state including lethargy, ascites, abdominal swelling and weight loss. In light of this, and considering the good health status of birds at the end of the study, together with the granulomatous peritonitis and the altered architecture of the infundibulum, we speculate that the presence of yolk in the abdomen was the result of erratic oviposition [37] due to a chronic damage of the oviduct. According to these evidences, the observed pathological picture could fall under the definition of non-septic egg peritonitis.

The spread of this LPAI virus beyond the respiratory and digestive districts and its high tropism for the infundibulum called for an in-depth analysis of the virus phenotype. Firstly, we evaluated the timing and routes of viral spread to the organs by RRT-PCR analysis of both the cellular and non-cellular fractions of the blood but we could not detect virus RNA. Even though we consider these negative results as the possible consequence of both a suboptimal sensitivity of the molecular techniques applied and the limited sampling times, we should also consider that H9N2 viruses have been rarely detected in the blood of chickens [39, 40] , either in the presence of a S. aureus co-infection [10] or after a combination of an intranasal and intratracheal challenge [41] .

Although we did not detect virus RNA in the blood, in some subjects the spleens, kidneys, brain and the oviducts were RRT-PCR positive on days 4 and 6 pi, even though attempts to isolate the virus and detect it by IHC gave positive results only in the case of the oviducts.

We hence hypothesize that the virus might have spread to the oviduct either systemically or via alternative routes, either by ascending the cloaca, or by contact with the infected abdominal air sacs and ovary. The latter case would be in keeping with the replication of the virus in the mesothelial cells of the oviduct serosa and the strong binding of the labelled virus to these cells. Unfortunately, Figure 6 Virus-histochemistry of the oviduct. Red staining indicates the binding of the FITC-labelled virus to the tissues. Sections are counterstained with hematoxylin. A The infundibulum showed a highly specific and uniform positivity of the cilia at the level of the epithelium lining the fimbriae. B In the magnum, we observed a specific staining of the ciliated epithelium but intensity was lower compared with the infundibulum. C No attachment of the virus was observed at the level of the isthmus epithelium. D The uterus showed a scattered but specific attachment of the virus to the cytoplasm of epithelial goblet cells.

we have no sufficient evidence to clearly support or discard any of the aforementioned routes.

The other intriguing feature of this virus is the strong tropism for the oviduct tissues, and in particular for the infundibulum. This feature might be a strain-specific characteristic, depending on either the ability to spread systemically, the cleavability of the HA by unknown oviduct-specific enzymes [42] , or the HA receptor binding preference that determines the attachment of the virus to the epithelia. Besides HPAI viruses, known to replicate in the reproductive tract of chickens [43] , LPAI viruses have been associated with oophoritis and salpingitis of gallinaceous poultry but mostly in turkey breeders [44] [45] [46] , while only few reports describe the colonization of the oviduct by non-H9 subtypes of LPAI viruses upon either natural or experimental infection [47] [48] [49] .

There is no consensus regarding the distribution and type of sialic acids on the epithelia along the chicken oviduct. Wang et al. [19] found that the infundibulum was the only section of the oviduct to be lacking sialic acids to which both the lectins Maackia amurensis (MAA) and the Sambucus nigra (SNA) could attach, while in the rest of the oviduct MAA bound abundantly to the epithelium, hence revealing a prevalence of avian-like α-2,3 sialic acids. Mork et al. [50] reported a completely different binding profile for the infundibulum, in which both SNA and MAA II abundantly attached to the epithelium, while in the rest of the oviduct, they confirmed a significant higher expression of α-2,3 sialic acids binding to both MAA I and MAA II, a result in keeping with the data by Sid et al. [42] . The apparent contradiction of these data likely derives from the different types, brands and concentrations of lectins and revelation methods adopted in the two studies [51, 52] . To overcome these issues, we opted for an alternative approach, incubating the oviduct histological sections with the labelled H9N2 virus and revealing its attachment by means of immunohistochemistry. The results confirmed that this virus has a strong specific preference for the cilia of the infundibulum epithelium, while in the magnum and uterus the virus attaches less than in the infundibulum, and even fails to do so at the level of the isthmus. These data, together with the higher incidence and severity of infections observed in the infundibulum, indicate that the high affinity of this virus for the receptors expressed in this section of the oviduct might be one of the main etiological determinants of the disease.

In the two papers in which oviduct infections were investigated upon experimental challenges with recent H9N2 viruses circulating in the Shaanxi province, China [18, 19] , the most affected sections were the magnum and the uterus, and in one study the infundibulum resulted to be negative by RRT-PCR. In one of these papers, a 60% drop in egg production in the first 7 days pi was associated with deposition of soft-shell eggs and a sudden decrease in the content of calcium in the eggshell, together with a reduction in the egg-shell thickness, confirming an overall preference of this virus for the chicken uterus [18] . These data and ours indicate that H9N2 viruses with a specific tropism for the chicken oviduct might have different anatomical preferences within the organ and this consistently translates into different pathological and productive scenarios.

In light of the laying performance, virological and pathological data, we believe that the experimental setting successfully reproduced the clinical disease, and the associated acute and chronic drops in egg production observed during G1-lineage H9N2 outbreaks in the field [4, 23] . Since we ruled out other microbiological agents as causes of salpingitis, the clinical picture associated with the replication of this virus in healthy chicken layers, allow us to think of it as an atypical pathotype of LPAI virus, capable of causing permanent economic losses, regardless of concomitant diseases in the flock. Under this perspective, we think this virus should be considered a primary pathogen of the oviduct, similarly to IBV, NDV and HPAI viruses [43, 53] .

Although other papers have experimentally proven a causative relationship between the replication of H9N2 viruses in the oviduct of layers and changes in the quality and number of laid eggs [18, 19] , their focus was limited to 1 week after the infection of SPF White Leghorn hens, and no microbiological examination was performed.

This paper is the first to offer an in-depth description of the pathogenic mechanism underlying the acute and chronic drops induced by a G1-lineage H9N2 virus in commercial layers.

To date, as opposed to HPAI viruses [54] , LPAI viruses have never been isolated from the internal content of eggs [55] . Given the high tropism of this virus for the oviduct, further analyses will clarify the role of eggs and egg products in the transmission of H9N2 viruses in poultry and the potential threat posed by their consumption in humans.

The control of this non-notifiable disease in Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa has been mainly restricted to the use of vaccines, and yet H9N2 viruses have evolved antigenically [56] and spread to new geographic areas, causing huge economic losses to the poultry industry. H9N2 viruses have shown to be highly promiscuous and to be carriers of particularly advantageous genes for the emergence of LPAI reassortant strains with zoonotic potential, such as the H7N9 and H10N8 viruses [57] . Moreover, there are serological and virological evidences

Intravenous immunoglobulin fails to improve ARDS in patients undergoing ECMO therapy

Background: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with high mortality rates. ARDS patients suffer from severe hypoxemia, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy may be necessary to ensure oxygenation. ARDS has various etiologies, including trauma, ischemia-reperfusion injury or infections of various origins, and the associated immunological responses may vary. To support the immunological response in this patient collective, we used intravenous IgM immunoglobulin therapy to enhance the likelihood of pulmonary recovery. Methods: ARDS patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) who were placed on ECMO and treated with (IVIG group; n = 29) or without (control group; n = 28) intravenous IgM-enriched immunoglobulins for 3 days in the initial stages of ARDS were analyzed retrospectively.

Results: The baseline characteristics did not differ between the groups, although the IVIG group showed a significantly reduced oxygenation index compared to the control group. We found no differences in the length of ICU stay or ventilation parameters. We did not find a significant difference between the groups for the extent of inflammation or for overall survival.

We conclude that administration of IgM-enriched immunoglobulins as an additional therapy did not have a beneficial effect in patients with severe ARDS requiring ECMO support.

Trial registration: Clinical Trials: NCT02961166; retrospectively registered.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by pulmonary inflammation that can be caused by pulmonary and extrapulmonary origins. Sepsis, bacterial pneumonia, polytrauma, and aspiration pneumonia are the most common causes of ARDS [1] . Predictors of survival include age, the type of underlying medical condition, the severity of pulmonary injury, the presence of extrapulmonary organ dysfunction, and ongoing sepsis [2] . Currently, clinical attempts to rescue ARDS patients include individualized ventilation and fluid management, adequate infection control, including early application of broad-spectrum anti-infectives, neuromuscular blockade using cisatracurium, sedation strategies, prone positioning, and finally extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to ensure oxygenation [3] [4] [5] . Although the incidence of ARDS is relatively high, with five to eight cases per 100,000 European inhabitants and even more in the USA, the various pathomechanisms are only partially understood, resulting in different experimental approaches to understand immune responses during early ARDS [6] .

One well-described issue is decreased immunoglobulin levels in patients with severe infection [6] as an element of the immunological response in the initial phase of inflammation in response to sepsis [7] . Therefore, one approach to support critically ill patients is intravenous administration of IgM-enriched immunoglobulins since this could potentially decrease the severity of inflammation. Although this treatment was omitted in recent sepsis guidelines due to a lack of supporting evidence in high-quality trials [8] , several studies, including one meta-analysis, describe beneficial effects of immunoglobulins in acute pneumonia induced by drug-resistant bacterial infections [9] [10] [11] . Furthermore, several case reports describe beneficial effects of antiviral therapy in combination with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in immune-compromised patients [12] [13] [14] . Based on these data, we treated patients with ARDS requiring ECMO therapy with IgM-enriched immunoglobulins immediately after intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The objective of this study was to investigate whether intravenous immunoglobulin administration could improve the clinical course of ARDS in patients treated with ECMO. Therefore, mortality, the duration of ECMO therapy, the incidence of renal replacement therapy, the duration of vasopressor and anti-infective therapy, length of stay in the ICU, and length of stay in the hospital were analyzed retrospectively in 57 ARDS patients requiring ECMO therapy.

The study was approved by the local research ethics committee of the University Hospital and the Eberhard-Karls University Tübingen, Germany.

Patients with severe ARDS treated with ECMO therapy between January 2012 and January 2016 at our institution were analyzed retrospectively. In all patients, ECMO therapy was required due to hypoxia and/or increased pulmonary resistance precluding protective lung ventilation.

ECMO therapy was performed according to the guidelines of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) using ILA-active Systems (Novalung, Stolberg, Germany [15] . Fifty-seven patients were analyzed. Twenty-eight patients were treated with IgM-enriched immunoglobulins (Pentaglobin®; Biotest; Dreieich, Germany) (IVIC-group). Pentaglobin is an IgM-enriched polyvalent immunoglobulin preparation derived from a plasma pool. It contains 6 mg of IgM, 6 mg of IgA, and 38 mg of IgG (63% IgG1, 26% IgG2, 4% IgG3, and 7% IgG4) per millilitre.

The indication for IgM-enriched immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment was determined at the discretion of the treating intensivist. IVIG was applied if a viral infection or an infection due to multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria (MRGN) was suspected. IVIG dosing was performed according to the instruction of the manufacturer: 0.4 ml/kg/h (up to 100 ml) as the initial dose, followed by 0.2 ml/kg/h for 72 h until a total dose of 15 mg/kg was achieved. Twenty-nine patients did not receive immunoglobulins (control group).

Vasopressors (Norepinephrine; Arterenol® Sanofi-Aventis; Germany) were used after volume resuscitation according to the sepsis guideline (13) . Renal replacement therapy was performed with citrate anticoagulation (Multifiltrate, Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg v.d.H. Germany) in patients with acute renal failure.

Data were retrospectively extracted from an ARDSspecific database at our institution. Since the electronic patient management system was changed during this time frame, not all required data were available for all ARDS patients.

MRSA and VRE screening was performed routinely in all patients admitted to the ICU.

To identify causal infections, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples, blood cultures, urinary samples, and perioperative samples were analyzed. In patients at risk, PCR for atypical pathogens was also performed in BAL samples. Infection was defined as > 10 6 colony-forming units (CFU) in BAL and/or urinary cultures. For blood cultures, any replicate of bacterial growth was defined as infection. During flu season, influenza infection was detected by PCR. BAL samples were also analyzed for other viral pathogens, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Positive findings for these viruses were confirmed by cell cultures. Patients with unknown pathogens and immune suppression were additionally screened for other pathogens.

Anti-infective therapy was applied according to the local guideline considering local resistance patterns.

Categorical data are reported as numbers and percentages, and continuous data are summarized with the median and range (i.e., the minimum and maximum values) unless otherwise indicated. To compare categorical variables or outcomes, such as the occurrence of infection or in-hospital death, between the IVIG group (n = 28 patients) and the control group, which included 29 patients who did not receive IVIG therapy, the chisquared test was used. For inter-group comparisons of continuous data, the two-tailed two-sample t test was generally performed. If the original data exhibited a lognormal distribution, e.g., ICU length of stay (LOS), then raw data were log-transformed prior to analysis with the t test. A p value < 0.05 was assumed to indicate a statistically significant difference between the groups. The data analysis was performed using JMP® 11.0 statistical software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

A total of 57 patients with ARDS requiring ECMO therapy between 2013 and 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. Twenty-eight patients were treated with IgM-enriched immunoglobulins (IVIG) for 3 days according to the manufacturer's instruction (IVIG group), and 29 patients did not receive IVIG therapy (control group). No adverse events were reported after IVIG application. The median age of both groups was 52 years, ranging from 27 to 76 years in the control group and from 17 to 78 years in the IVIG group. The median Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) and Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) score were comparable between both groups ( Table 1 ). The median APACHE score in the IVIG group was 24 vs. 23 in the control group. In 30% (8/27) of the IVIGtreated patients and 31% (9/29) of the control patients, the APACHE score was equal to or greater than 28. Regarding preexisting disease, diabetes mellitus, cardiac disease, immune suppression, and malignancy were more common in the IVIG group (Table 1) .

Five patients in the control group suffered ARDS of extrapulmonary origin (three patients with pancreatitis and two with polytrauma). The initial PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio in the IVIG group was significantly lower than that in the control group (IVIG, median 67 vs control, 93; t test, log-transformed data, p = 0.009). Seventy-five percent of the IVIG-treated patients had severe ARDS, 25% had moderate ARDS, and no patient showed mild ARDS. In the control group, 55% of patients had severe ARDS, 35% had moderate ARDS, and 10% had mild ARDS. The ECMO duration was shorter in the control group (1-45 days; median 14 days) compared to that in the IVIG group (4-78 days; median 18 days) and could be reduced earlier in the control group (median 10 days) than in the IVIG group (median 16 days). The duration of ventilator support was longer in the IVIG group (91-2005 h; median 571 h) compared to that in the control group (20-1323 h; median 399 h; t test, logtransformed data, p = 0.055). Five patients in the control group and three patients in the IVIG group were extubated before ECMO was discontinued. Ten patients in the control group and seven patients in the IVIG group suffered anemia due to bleeding complications, including cerebral hemorrhage (control: n = 3; IVIG: n = 2) ( Table 1) .

All patients suffered from septic shock requiring vasopressor therapy (control, 1-27 days vs. IVIG, 2-42 days). Renal replacement therapy was more often required in the control group (54% vs. 66%; p = 0.36; Pearson's chi-squared test). Hepatobiliary dysfunction was comparable between both groups (control, 24%; IVIG, 21%).

In 66% of the control patients and 82% of the IVIG-treated patients, one or more pathogens could be identified as the cause of pulmonary inflammation. In 11 (38%) patients in the control group, bacterial pathogens such as Legionella (n = 1; 3%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1; 3%), Pneumocystis jirovecii (n = 3; 10%), and E. coli (n = 3; 10%) were identified in BAL samples. None of the control patients showed multidrug-resistant bacteria in any samples. In 28% (8 of 29) of the control patients, a viral pathogen was detected in BAL samples: influenza (n = 3; 10%) and herpes virus (n = 6; 21%). Herpes virus infection included HSV (n = 5; 17%) and CMV (n = 2; 7%). Herpes viral infection was confirmed by cell-based culture. In five of the control patients, fungal infection was diagnosed via blood culture (n = 1), abdominal sample (n = 2), and BAL (Aspergillus, n = 2). In nine control patients, no causal pathogen could be identified (31%).

Two of the 28 IVIG patients were infected with resistant bacteria (3MRGN Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and MRSA). In 11 IVIG patients, bacterial pathogens such as Legionella (n = 3; 11%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 3; 11%), Pneumocystis jirovecii (n = 3; 11%), and Mycoplasma (n = 1) were identified in BAL samples. Viral infections were more frequent in the IVIG group (p = 0.046; Pearson's chi-squared test), especially influenza infection (p < 0.05). In more than half of the IVIG patients, viral pneumonia was diagnosed according to the results of BAL samples, radiological findings, and clinical symptoms. One or more of the following viruses could be detected in BAL samples: influenza (n = 10; 36%) and herpes virus (n = 9; 32%). Herpes virus infection included HSV (n = 7; 25%), CMV (n = 2; 7%), and HHV6 (in BAL and blood; n = 1). In 7 of the IVIG-treated patients, fungal infection was diagnosed in urinary tract (n = 4) and abdominal samples (n = 2). In addition, one patient suffered aspergillosis pneumonia. In three IVIGpatients, no causal pathogen could be identified (11%).

The duration of anti-infective treatment was significantly longer in the IVIG group than that in the control group (control, median 12 days; 2-40 days; IVIG, median 18 days; 3-65 days; t test, log-transformed data, p = 0.0096). Six patients in the control group and four patients in the IVIG group underwent anti-infective treatment before admission to the ICU. Excluding these patients, the duration of anti-infective therapy relative to LOS in the ICU was not significantly different between the groups (control median, 71% fraction of LOS ICU; IVIG, 79% of LOS ICU).

Patients treated with IVIG stayed for a median of 24.5 days in the ICU (5 to 89 days) and 28.5 days in the Fig. 1 ). Forty-three percent (12 out of 28) of these patients died; three patients died within the first week due to cerebral hemorrhage (n = 2) or multiorgan failure due to septic shock (n = 1). The control patients spent a median of 24 days in the ICU (1 to 56 days) and 27 days in the hospital (1 to 88 days); 52% (15 out of 29) of these patients died. Five patients died during within first week due to cerebral hemorrhage, heart failure, subarachnoidal bleeding (polytrauma), and hypoxic brain injury 24 h after admission, and others died of multiorgan failure due to acute pancreatitis.

Lymphocyte levels were analyzed retrospectively when available. Initially after admission, lymphocyte levels were not different between the groups (control alive 8.3% ± 3.4; control dead 8.9% ± 4.5; IVIG alive 8.9% ± 4.4; IVIG dead 7.3% ± 5.7). However, lymphocyte levels were higher in survivors compared to those in non-survivors (Fig. 2) . The increase in lymphocytes was more prominent in survivors compared to that in non-survivors (control alive 1.74 ± 0.85; IVIG alive 3.16 ± 5.03; control dead 0.92 ± 0.17; IVIG dead 2.13 ± 1.55; Fig. 3 ). In addition, in patients treated with IVIG, this increase during treatment was more prominent than that in the control group in the first 28 days (Fig. 3 ). Since we did not evaluate differential blood counts routinely, limited data were available for determining significant difference.

The purpose of this analysis was to systematically investigate the potential effect of IgM-enriched immunoglobulins on the outcomes of ARDS patients requiring ECMO therapy. We analyzed 57 patients; 28 patients were treated with IgM-enriched IVIG, and 29 patients did not receive IVIG therapy. Of all patients suffering from septic shock, 75 % of the IVIG-treated patients and 55% of the control patients had severe ARDS of various origins. However, although the IVIG group had a lower PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio and required longer ventilation support, longer vasopressor therapy, and longer anti-infective therapy and included MRGN-infected patients, outcome parameters such as LOS in the ICU, LOS in the hospital, and mortality were not significantly different between the groups.

In several studies, hypogammaglobulinemia and overexpression of genes encoding immunoglobulin segments were identified in patients with septic shock [6, 16, 17] . Therefore, IVIG treatment could be a logical requirement in these patients. We included IVIG therapy in our ARDS patients based on these considerations, although we did not measure immunoglobulin levels before treatment. Indeed, in a recent retrospective analysis of 543 patients, high IgG levels were associated with high mortality in sepsis patients [18] . PCR analysis showed an early molecular response to IgM in the blood of patients with sepsis [19] . IgM levels remain low in non-surviving sepsis patients, whereas IgM levels increase transiently in surviving patients [20] . Single studies and metaanalyses have shown beneficial effects of IVIG therapy in patients with sepsis [21] [22] [23] . However, IVIG treatment remains controversial. Randomized studies have not shown any beneficial effect of this intervention in patients with sepsis or sepsis-associated conditions [8] . Therefore, IVIG therapy is not currently recommended in the latest sepsis guidelines [24] .

Immunoglobulins interact with CD4 T-lymphocytes during bacterial eradication. In severe sepsis, B and T cells are depleted due to apoptosis [25] . Since our analysis is retrospective, we could not measure HLA-DR expression or cytokine profiles in these patients. However, we found a trend of increased lymphocytes in non-survivors compared to survivors, which may reflect why we did not see any beneficial effect of IVIG therapy. Although immunoglobulins may play an important role in the innate immune response during ARDS, nonspecific immunoglobulins may not be as effective in a lymphopenia environment. Lymphopenia has been described in ARDS patients and in animal models after viral infection or mycoplasma infection and affects all lymphoid tissue [26] [27] [28] . However, in our small group of [29, 30] , but whether this variability in response is due to genetic alterations [31] , immune evasion by bacteria [32] , or different stages of sepsis is unknown. This study has some limitations. It is a retrospective analysis of a limited number of ARDS patients. Since we changed our ECMO system during the study period, we only included patients treated with the one system to exclude any impact of system differences. Furthermore, since IVIG was ordered by a physician primarily when a viral infection or MRGN infection was suspected, the IVIG group included more patients with these infections. However, this may reflect true clinical circumstances in that the cause of disease is typically not determined at admission.

ARDS is a multifactorial disease with a heterogeneous pathogenesis and variable timing and clinical presentations. Therefore, one specific therapy is unlikely to improve outcomes. Rather than excluding single therapeutic options, identifying patients' risk factors and the individual ARDS stage may be more important for successful outcomes. We report here in our retrospective analysis that intravenous IgM administration in the initial stages of severe ARDS did not improve overall outcomes or the severity of disease. 

MINI REVIEW Function of the Deubiquitinating Enzyme USP46 in the Nervous System and Its Regulation by WD40-Repeat Proteins

Posttranslational modification of proteins by ubiquitin regulates synapse development and synaptic transmission. Much progress has been made investigating the role of ubiquitin ligases at the synapse, however very little is known about the deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) which remove ubiquitin from target proteins. Although there are far fewer DUBs than ubiquitin ligases encoded by the human genome, it is becoming clear that DUBs have very specific physiological functions, suggesting that DUB activity is tightly regulated in vivo. Many DUBs function as part of larger protein complexes, and multiple regulatory mechanisms exist to control the expression, localization and catalytic activity of DUBs. In this review article, we focus on the role of the DUB USP46 in the nervous system, and illustrate potential mechanisms of regulating DUBs by describing how USP46 is regulated by two WD40-repeat (WDR) proteins, WDR48/UAF1 and WDR20, based on recent structural studies and genetic analyses in vivo.

Ubiquitination is a widely used posttranslational modification that has emerged as a key regulator of synapse development and function (DiAntonio and Hicke, 2004; Mabb and Ehlers, 2010) . Ubiquitination of a growing list of pre-and postsynaptic proteins can regulate their stability, function and subcellular localization (Mabb and Ehlers, 2010; Bingol and Sheng, 2011; Kowalski and Juo, 2012) . The covalent attachment of ubiquitin to lysine residues on target proteins is catalyzed by a sequence of enzymatic reactions mediated by E1 ubiquitin-activating enzymes, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and E3 ubiquitin ligases (Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998) . Ubiquitin itself has seven lysine residues and a primary amine at its N-terminus that can be utilized to form ubiquitin chains. Monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination, using various chain-linkage types, create distinct structural topologies that are recognized by ubiquitin binding proteins that mediate the various functions of ubiquitin. For example, Lys48-and Lys11-linked polyubiquitination result in proteasomal degradation, whereas Lys63-linked polyubiquitination is typically associated with signaling and endo-lysosomal trafficking (Piper and Lehner, 2011; Clague et al., 2012; Nathan et al., 2013) . Ubiquitin can be removed from substrates by proteases called deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). The human genome encodes approximately 100 DUBs that are categorized into six families. The ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) make up the largest family, comprised of 54 cysteine proteases (Nijman et al., 2005; Mevissen and Komander, 2017) .

There are six times more ubiquitin ligases than DUBs in the human genome, suggesting that DUBs might have more promiscuous substrate specificity than ubiquitin ligases (Komander et al., 2009) . However, emerging evidence indicate that DUBs have very specific cellular functions and are selective for certain substrates and ubiquitin chain types, suggesting that precise mechanisms exist to regulate DUBs (Clague et al., 2013) . Although some DUBs, such as UCH-L1, have been heavily studied in the nervous system, the function and regulation of most neuronal DUBs are poorly understood (Todi and Paulson, 2011; Kowalski and Juo, 2012) . In this review article, we illustrate potential mechanisms of DUB regulation by focusing on the role of the conserved DUB USP46 in the nervous system, and ways in which two WD40-repeat (WDR) proteins control its function. We highlight recent structural insights into how WDR proteins interact with and regulate USP46, and discuss functions for the USP46/WDR protein complex in the nervous system and across phylogeny.

AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediate the majority of fast excitatory transmission in the brain, and regulation of synaptic AMPAR levels is important for controlling synapse development and function. AMPARs are assembled as hetero-tetramers comprised of various combinations of the pore-forming subunits GluA1-A4. Subunit composition and association with auxiliary subunits determine the biophysical and trafficking properties of the channel (Anggono and Huganir, 2012) . AMPARs can be regulated by multiple posttranslational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which controls receptor trafficking and degradation (Goo et al., 2015) . Studies of the AMPAR GLR-1, which shares 40%-50% identity with rat GluA1 and GluA2 (Hart et al., 1995; Brockie et al., 2001) , in C. elegans were the first to show that glutamate receptors (GluRs) are regulated by ubiquitin (Burbea et al., 2002) . Ubiquitin is directly conjugated to the cytoplasmic tail of GLR-1, providing a signal for clathrinmediated endocytosis and subsequent degradation (Burbea et al., 2002) . Later studies showed that all four mammalian AMPAR subunits, GluA1-A4, are also regulated by ubiquitin (Schwarz et al., 2010; Fu et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2011; Lussier et al., 2011; Widagdo et al., 2015) . Although several studies suggest that AMPARs are likely ubiquitinated at the plasma membrane prior to internalization (Burbea et al., 2002; Schwarz et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2011) , other studies propose that AMPARs are ubiquitinated at endosomes (Lussier et al., 2011; Widagdo et al., 2015) , prior to degradation in the lysosome. Future research will be necessary to determine if stimulus type, intensity or duration determine the subcellular site of ubiquitination.

While several ubiquitin ligases have been shown to regulate AMPARs (reviewed in Goo et al., 2015) , much less is known about the relevant DUBs. USP-46 was identified in a focused RNAi screen in C. elegans as the first DUB to regulate GluRs. Usp-46 loss-of-function mutants exhibit increased levels of ubiquitinated GLR-1 and decreased levels of GLR-1 at synapses (Kowalski et al., 2011) . The abundance of GLR-1(4KR), a mutant receptor which cannot be ubiquitinated, is unaffected in usp-46 loss-of-function mutants leading to a model where USP-46 deubiquitinates GLR-1 to regulate its abundance. USP-46 regulation of GLR-1 is physiologically relevant because usp-46 loss-of-function mutants have reduced cell surface levels of GLR-1 and corresponding defects in GLR-1dependent behaviors. Together with data showing that USP-46 partially colocalizes with endosomes, Kowalski et al. (2011) proposed a model where USP-46 acts at endosomes to promote GLR-1 stability and recycling to the cell surface. Consistent with this model, a recent study showed that mammalian GluA1(KR), which cannot be ubiquitinated, escapes lysosomal degradation and recycles back to the cell surface (Widagdo et al., 2015) .

C. elegans USP-46 is highly homologous to both mammalian USP46 and its paralog USP12 (the paralogs share 88% amino acid identity; Kowalski et al., 2011) . A recent study using cultured rodent neurons showed that USP46 regulation of AMPARs is conserved in mammals. Mammalian USP46 can deubiquitinate both GluA1 and GluA2 subunits and protect AMPARs from degradation (Huo et al., 2015) . USP46 is expressed throughout the brain, including the hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum and prefrontal cortex, and colocalizes with GluA1 and PSD95 at synapses in cultured neurons (Tomida et al., 2009; Huo et al., 2015) . Knock-down of USP46, but not USP12, results in increased levels of ubiquitinated GluA1, decreased surface and total levels of GluA1, and reduced mEPSC amplitudes, consistent with a role for USP46 in deubiquitinating mammalian AMPARs (Huo et al., 2015) . Interestingly, GluA1 is preferentially modified with Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains, which typically promotes endo-lysosomal trafficking (Huo et al., 2015; Widagdo et al., 2015) . Prior studies showed that USP enzymes have promiscuous chain selectivity and recombinant USP46 prefers Lys6-and Lys11linked polyubiquitin chains in vitro (Faesen et al., 2011) . In contrast, Huo et al. (2015) showed that USP46 preferentially deubiquitinates AMPARs with Lys63-but not Lys48-linked chains in HEK293 cells, suggesting that USP46 chain specificity is controlled by other factors in vivo. Together, these data reveal a conserved mechanism where USP46 deubiquitinates AMPARs at synapses to protect them from degradation and promote their recycling to the cell surface to affect synapse function. In addition to USP46, USP8 can also deubiquitinate mammalian AMPARs indicating that multiple regulatory mechanisms exist to control AMPAR ubiquitination levels (Scudder et al., 2014) .

Ionotropic GABA A receptors mediate the majority of fast inhibitory transmission in the brain. GABA A receptors are comprised of hetero-pentamers and ubiquitination of specific subunits can regulate receptor trafficking and degradation in an activity-dependent manner (Saliba et al., 2007; Jacob et al., 2008; Arancibia-Cárcamo et al., 2009) .

USP46 is also implicated in regulating the GABAergic system in mice. Tomida et al. (2009) discovered that an inbred strain of mice (CS strain) known to have defects in circadian rhythms, also exhibits changes in depression-like behaviors consistent with an anti-depressive state. Quantitative trait locus mapping of the CS mice identified a 3bp deletion in a conserved lysine ( K92) in USP46. Importantly, USP46 knock-out (KO) mice exhibit similar changes in depression-like behaviors (Imai et al., 2013) and broad expression of a wild type USP46 transgene in CS mice rescued these behaviors (Tomida et al., 2009) . The magnitude of behavioral effects in the USP46 ( K92) mutant mice were not as strong as those observed in USP46 KO mice (Imai et al., 2013) , suggesting that the K92 mutation does not completely eliminate USP46 activity. Indeed, in vitro deubiquitination assays revealed that USP46( K92) still retains some enzymatic activity (Zhang et al., 2011) .

Several experiments suggest that USP46 loss-offunction affects the GABAergic system. First, hippocampal immunohistochemistry showed reduced expression of the GABA synthesis enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) in USP46 ( K92) mutants (Tomida et al., 2009) , suggesting that USP46 may regulate GABA synthesis. Second, muscimol-induced postsynaptic GABA A receptor currents were slightly reduced in hippocampal neurons of USP46 ( K92) mutants. This effect may be mediated by extrasynaptic GABA A receptors since no alterations were observed in mIPSC amplitude or frequency (Tomida et al., 2009) . Third, administration of the GABA A receptor agonist, nitrazepam, restores depression-like behavior in USP46 ( K92) and KO mutant mice, and these effects could be blocked by the GABA A receptor antagonist flumazenil (Imai et al., 2012) . Together, these data suggest that USP46 affects both preand postsynaptic components of the GABA system, however the precise mechanism is not known. One possibility is that USP46 may indirectly affect the GABA system as a compensatory response to a primary defect in AMPAR degradation in excitatory neurons. It will be important in the future to test if USP46 functions in GABA neurons and whether it directly deubiquitinates components of the GABA system.

WDR proteins are involved in protein-protein interactions that mediate diverse cellular processes. WDRs consist of 40-60 amino acids ending in a tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD) motif. The WDR form a funnel-shaped, β-propeller structure made up of 6-8 blades, with each blade consisting of four anti-parallel β-sheets that are held together by extensive hydrogen bonds. This rigid β-propeller structure provides multiple stable surfaces for protein interactions (Pashkova et al., 2010; Stirnimann et al., 2010; Villamil et al., 2013) .

Mammalian USP46 and USP12 are comprised largely of a core catalytic domain that exhibits low intrinsic activity (Cohn et al., 2009; Kee et al., 2010; Faesen et al., 2011) . Biochemical and proteomic studies showed that two WDR proteins, WDR48 (also known as USP1-associated factor, UAF1) and WDR20, interact with USP46 and USP12 (Cohn et al., 2009; Sowa et al., 2009; Kee et al., 2010) . WDR48 stimulates the activity of three DUBs, USP12, USP46 and USP1, a DUB which regulates the Fanconi anemia DNA damage pathway (Cohn et al., 2007 (Cohn et al., , 2009 Faesen et al., 2011) . WDR20 forms a unique ternary complex with WDR48 and either USP12 or USP46 (Sowa et al., 2009; Kee et al., 2010) and further enhances their catalytic activity in vitro (Kee et al., 2010; Faesen et al., 2011) . Intriguingly, a large-scale proteomic analysis of DUB-interacting proteins in HEK293 cells revealed that 36% of the 75 DUBs analyzed interact with a WDR protein, suggesting a broad role for WDR proteins in regulating DUBs (Sowa et al., 2009) .

Both WDR48 and WDR20 stimulate USP12 and USP46 catalytic activity (k cat ) without increasing substrate binding affinity (K m ; Faesen et al., 2011; Dharadhar et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016) , suggesting that the WDR proteins may affect DUB activity via a novel structural mechanism. Three recent studies provide crystal structures of the WDR proteins in complex with USP12 and USP46. USP12 and USP46 were each crystallized bound to WDR48/UAF1 (Yin et al., 2015; Dharadhar et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016) , and USP12 was also crystalized in a ternary complex with WDR48 and WDR20 (Li et al., 2016) . WDR48 and WDR20 bind the DUBs relatively far from the catalytic cleft and stimulate DUB catalytic activity via allosteric mechanisms (Figure 1 ; Yin et al., 2015; Dharadhar et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016) . USP12 and USP46 exhibit the conserved USP fold structure comprised of Fingers, Palm and Thumb subdomains, with the catalytic triad of cysteine, histidine and aspartic acid, nestled in between the Palm and Thumb FIGURE 1 | Model of USP46 bound to WDR48 and WDR20. This model is inferred from a combination of structures of USP46 bound to WDR48 and ubiquitin (Yin et al., 2015) and USP12 bound to WDR48 and WDR20 (Li et al., 2016) . SLD, Sumo-Like Domain; AD, Ancillary Domain; β-prop, β-propellar of WD40-repeat domain; Cys, active-site Cysteine residue.

regions. The ''top'' narrow end of the β-propeller funnel of WDR48 interacts with the tip of the USP Fingers subdomain, whereas the WDR48 ancillary domain (AD) and sumo-like domain (SLD) curve around ubiquitin, which binds in the Palm region of the DUB. The C-terminal glycine residue and tail of ubiquitin extend towards the active site cysteine of the DUB. While Yin et al. (2015) and Dharadhar et al. (2016) crystallized their complexes in the presence of an ubiquitin-bound substrate, Li et al. (2016) crystallized USP12 in complex with WDR48 and WDR20 in the absence of bound-ubiquitin, providing additional structural insight. For example, the ''Pinky Finger'' β-sheet of the Fingers subdomain appears disordered or displaced in apoUSP12, whereas the four antiparallel β-sheets of the Fingers subdomain are rigid in other USP structures (Hu et al., 2002; Avvakumov et al., 2006; Ratia et al., 2006; Renatus et al., 2006; Yin et al., 2015) . Binding of WDR48 to the tip of the Fingers subdomain stabilizes the ''Pinky Finger'' and Fingers subdomain, which may ultimately propagate to the catalytic cleft in the presence of substrate (Li et al., 2016) . WDR20 also binds the DUB via the ''top'' face of its β-propeller but interacts with the bottom of the palm subdomain of USP12 to promote an optimal alignment of the catalytic cleft (Li et al., 2016) . Together, these structural studies suggest that binding of the WDR proteins to USP12 or USP46 relatively far from the active site results in the rearrangement of several structural elements, which propagates to the catalytic triad increasing enzyme catalysis.

These recent structural and biochemical studies complement in vivo studies of the USP-46/WDR-48/WDR-20 complex in C. elegans. Dahlberg and Juo (2014) showed that the C. elegans homologs of WDR48 and WDR20 form a stable ternary complex with USP-46 in HEK293T cells. Consistent with prior studies (Cohn et al., 2009; Kee et al., 2010; Faesen et al., 2011) , full activation of C. elegans USP-46 catalytic activity in vitro requires both WDR48 and WDR20 (Dahlberg and Juo, 2014) . In contrast to the increased degradation of GLR-1 observed in usp-46 loss-of-function mutants (Kowalski et al., 2011) , overexpression of usp-46 in neurons does not stabilize GLR-1 (Dahlberg and Juo, 2014) . However, co-expression of WDR-48 and WDR-20 in neurons did increase surface and total levels of GLR-1 as well as glutamate-dependent behavior in an usp-46-dependent manner. These data suggest that endogenous WDR-48 and WDR-20 may be limiting in vivo. Together with data showing that co-expression of the USP-46/WDR-48/WDR-20 complex reduces levels of ubiquitinated GLR-1 (Dahlberg and Juo, 2014) , these results support a model wherein USP-46, when bound to WDR-48 and WDR-20, deubiquitinates GLR-1 and increases receptor stability and function in vivo.

Interestingly, Huo et al. (2015) showed that knock-down of mammalian USP46 has a greater effect on reducing surface GluA1 (42% decrease) and mEPSC amplitude (32% decrease) than overexpression of USP46 (18%-20% increase in surface GluA1 and mEPSC amplitudes; Huo et al., 2015) . The more modest effects of USP46 overexpression are consistent with the low intrinsic catalytic activity of USP46 in the absence of WDR48 and WDR20 (Cohn et al., 2009; Faesen et al., 2011) . Intriguingly, Huo et al. (2015) also showed that mammalian USP46, but not USP12, was able to regulate GluA1 in neurons. It will be interesting to determine how USP46 and USP12 achieve substrate specificity in vivo given that they can both interact with WDR48 and WDR20.

WDR proteins and USP46 are conserved across phylogeny from yeast to humans (Table 1) . Studies in the multicellular filamentous fungi Aspergillus nidulans were the first to describe a role for WDR proteins in regulating DUBs Kelly, 2001, 2002) . CreB, which is homologous to USP46 and USP12, and CreC, which is homologous to WDR20, were identified in a screen for genes involved in carbon catabolite repression and gene expression. Genetic experiments revealed that CreC acts upstream of CreB and that CreC stabilizes CreB by interacting with and preventing proteolysis of the DUB (Lockington and Kelly, 2002) .

In the unicellular fission yeast S. pombe, the USP46 homolog Ubp9 regulates endocytosis, actin dynamics and cell polarity (Kouranti et al., 2010) . Much like its counterparts in other systems, Ubp9 is only catalytically active when bound to two WDR proteins, Bun107, which is homologous to WDR48, and Bun62, which is homologous to WDR20. Interestingly, Ubp9 stability and subcellular localization can be regulated by interaction with the WDR proteins. Kouranti et al. (2010) .

Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org

In the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, the USP46 homolog Ubp9, and the closely related DUB Ubp13, regulate mitochondrial function by controlling the biosynthesis of a key ATP synthase subunit (Kanga et al., 2012) . These DUBs interact with the WDR48 homolog Duf1. Consistent with other studies, Duf1 stimulates Ubp9 and Ubp13 catalytic activity and is required for the physiological function of these enzymes in vivo. Interestingly, the WD40 domain of Duf1 can interact directly with ubiquitin (Pashkova et al., 2010) , hinting at another potential role for these WDR proteins.

Similar to C. elegans, the genome of the fruit fly Drosophila melonagaster encodes for one DUB, CG7023, that is homologous to both USP46 and USP12 (Moretti et al., 2012; Tsou et al., 2012) and one homolog each of WDR48 and WDR20 ( Table 1 ). CG7023/USP12 was shown to negatively regulate Notch signaling in flies (Moretti et al., 2012) . Partial RNAi knock-down of CG7023/USP12 in the fly nervous system did not reveal any obvious neuronal phenotypes (Tsou et al., 2012) . It will be informative to investigate the null phenotype of the WDR proteins and USP12 in the fly nervous system.

DUBs have emerged as critical regulators of a large number of ubiquitin-dependent processes including synapse development and function. Growing evidence indicates that DUB localization and activity are tightly controlled in vivo through proteinprotein interactions. Here, we highlighted recent progress in our understanding of how WDR proteins, WDR48 and WDR20, interact with and activate USP12 and USP46. Future studies should reveal if WDR48 and WDR20 expression or subcellular localization are regulated in neurons as a mechanism to control DUB function. Understanding how DUB function is regulated in vivo will provide critical information for the design of better drugs to fine-tune ubiquitin-regulation of protein trafficking or degradation of key proteins. Interestingly, although one human genetic study found no association between USP46 mutations and bipolar disorder or schizophrenia (Kushima et al., 2010) , another study identified USP46 as a candidate gene associated with early-onset essential tremor (Liu et al., 2016) . It will be interesting to learn if mutations in USP46 or its regulators are associated with other neurological disorders given the importance of USP46 in both glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling.

ARTICLE In vivo protection against ZIKV infection and pathogenesis through passive antibody transfer and active immunisation with a prMEnv DNA vaccine

Significant concerns have been raised owing to the rapid global spread of infection and disease caused by the mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV). Recent studies suggest that ZIKV can also be transmitted sexually, further increasing the exposure risk for this virus. Associated with this spread is a dramatic increase in cases of microcephaly and additional congenital abnormalities in infants of ZIKV-infected mothers, as well as a rise in the occurrence of Guillain Barre' syndrome in infected adults. Importantly, there are no licensed therapies or vaccines against ZIKV infection. In this study, we generate and evaluate the in vivo efficacy of a novel, synthetic, DNA vaccine targeting the pre-membrane+envelope proteins (prME) of ZIKV. Following initial in vitro development and evaluation studies of the plasmid construct, mice and non-human primates were immunised with this prME DNA-based immunogen through electroporation-mediated enhanced DNA delivery. Vaccinated animals were found to generate antigen-specific cellular and humoral immunity and neutralisation activity. In mice lacking receptors for interferon (IFN)-α/β (designated IFNAR − / − ) immunisation with this DNA vaccine induced, following in vivo viral challenge, 100% protection against infection-associated weight loss or death in addition to preventing viral pathology in brain tissue. In addition, passive transfer of non-human primate anti-ZIKV immune serum protected IFNAR − / − mice against subsequent viral challenge. This study in NHP and in a pathogenic mouse model supports the importance of immune responses targeting prME in ZIKV infection and suggests that additional research on this vaccine approach may have relevance for ZIKV control and disease prevention in humans.

Zika virus (ZIKV) is a single-stranded, positive sense RNA flavivirus, 1 spread primarily through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitos. [2] [3] [4] However, during the recent outbreak in South and Central America, novel mechanisms of ZIKV transmission have been described including sexual and transplacental transmission. [5] [6] [7] The virus is endemic in parts of Africa and Asia and has spread unabated through South America, Mexico and the Caribbean over the last 2 years. 8, 9 Factors including increased global travel and an expansion of the range of Aedes mosquitos owing to climate change portend further spread of this virus, expanding its range in the southern United States over the next few years. 5, 9 ZIKV infection presents with a prodrome of myalgias, arthralgias, malaise and low-grade fever with a rash appearing approximately 7 days post infection that may occur with conjunctivitis and retro-orbital pain. The clinical presentation is similar to, albeit less severe than, chikungunya and dengue viral infections, which are also transmitted through the same mosquito vectors. During the French Polynesian outbreak in 2013, an increased risk of Guillain Barre' syndrome was identified in infected individuals. 4, 6, 10 Alarmingly, during the recent outbreak in South and Central America, microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities in infants have been observed in mothers who were infected by ZIKV during pregnancy. [11] [12] [13] In April 2016, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the link between ZIKV infection and microcephaly establishing ZIKV as a teratogen. There are currently no licensed therapies or vaccines against ZIKV infection. Therefore, the development and evaluation of potential vaccines to control and halt the spread of this rapidly emerging infectious agent is of high priority. 14 Here we describe the development and evaluation of a synthetic ZIKV prME DNA vaccine delivered by electroporation for its immunogenicity and its impact on ZIKV infection in a pathogenic animal challenge model. 1 

Construction of the ZIKV-prME consensus DNA vaccine A consensus sequence of ZIKV prM (precursor membrane and Envelope (Env) genes (ZIKV-prME) was generated using prM and Env sequences from various ZIKV isolated between the years of 1952 and 2015, which caused infection in humans. The ZIKV-prME consensus sequence was cloned into the pVax1 vector after additional modifications and optimisations were made to improve its in vivo expression including the addition of a highly efficient immunoglobulin E (IgE) leader peptide sequence (Figure 1a ). Optimal alignment of ZIKV-Env sequences was performed using homology models and visualisation on Discovery Studio 4.5. Reference models included PDB 5JHM and PDB 5IZ7. Aligned residues corresponding to specific regions on the prME antigen were labelled in the models for visualisation purposes (Figure 1b) . The optimised consensus vaccine selections are, in general, conservative or semi-conservative relative to multiple ZIKV strains analysed in this study. Structural studies of EDE-specific neutralising antibodies have revealed that these recognition determinants can be found at a serotype-invariant site at the Env-dimer interface, which includes the exposed main chain of the fusion loop and two conserved glycan chains (N67-and N153linked glycans). 15 These two glycosylation sites are not highly conserved in other flaviviruses. Moreover, ZIKV does not possess the N67-linked glycosylation site, and the N154-linked glycosylation site (equivalent to the N153-linked glycosylation site in dengue) is absent in some of the isolated ZIKV strains. As part of the consensus design, we therefore designed the construct leaving out this glycosylation site. Lack of glycosylation at this site has been correlated with improved binding of EDE1 type broadly neutralising antibodies (bnAbs) to ZIKV-Env protein. 15 Subsequent to construction, expression of the ZIKV-prME protein from the plasmid was confirmed by western blot analysis and an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The protein extracts prepared from the cells transiently transfected with ZIKV-prME were analysed for expression by western blot using a panflavivirus antibody (Figure 1c ) and sera collected from ZIKV-prME immunised mice (Figure 1d ). ZIKV-prME expression was further detected by IFA by the staining of 293T cells transfected Figure 1 . Construction of the ZIKV-prME consensus DNA vaccine. (a) Diagrammatic representation of the ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine indicating the cloning of prME into the pVax1 mammalian expression vector. A consensus design strategy was adopted for the ZIKV-prME consensus sequence. Codon-optimised synthetic genes of the prME construct included a synthetic IgE leader sequence. The optimised gene construct was inserted into the BamH1 and Xho1 sites of a modified pVax1 vector under the control of the CMV promoter. (b) Model building of the ZIKV-E proteins demonstrates overlap of the vaccine target with potentially relevant epitope regions. Several changes made for vaccine design purpose are located in domains II and III (located within dashed lines of inset, middle left). Vaccine-specific residue changes in these regions are shown in violet CPK format on a ribbon backbone representation of an E Env protein dimer (each chain in light and dark green, respectively). Regions corresponding to the defined EDE are indicated in cyan, and the fusion loop is indicated in blue. Residue Ile156 (T156I) of the vaccine E protein, modelled as exposed on the surface of the 150 loop, is part of an N-linked glycosylation motif NXS/T in several other ZIKV strains as well as in multiple dengue virus strains. (c and d) Expression analysis by SDS-PAGE of ZIKV-prME protein expression in 293T cells using western blot analysis. The 293T cells were transfected with the ZIKV-prME plasmid and the cell lysates and supernatants were analysed for expression of the vaccine construct with pan-flavivirus (c) or Sera from ZIKV-prME immunized mice (d). Protein molecular weight markers (kDa); cell lysate and supernatant from ZIKV-prME transfected cells and rZIKV-E positive control were loaded as indicated. (e) Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) analysis for ZIKV-prME protein expression in 293T cells. The cells were transfected with 5 μg of the ZIKV-prME plasmid. Twenty-four hours post transfection, immunofluorescence labelling was performed with the addition of sera (1:100) from ZIKV-prME immunised mice followed by the addition of the secondary anti-mouse IgG-AF488 antibody for detection. Staining with sera from ZIKV-prME and pVax1 immunised mice is shown. DAPI panels show control staining of cell nuclei. Overlay panels are combinations of antimouse IgG-AF488 and DAPI staining patterns. DAPI, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; ZIKV-prME, precursor membrane and Env of Zika virus.

ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine induces antigen-specific T cells in C57BL/6 mice The ability of the ZIKV-prME plasmid vaccine to induce cellular immune responses was evaluated. Groups of four female C57BL/6 mice were immunised with either the control plasmid backbone (pVax1) or the ZIKV-prME plasmid vaccine three times at 2 week intervals through intramuscular (i.m.) injection followed by electroporation at the site of delivery (Figure 2a ). One week after the third injection bulk splenocytes harvested from each animal and evaluated in ELISpot assays for their ability to secrete interferon-γ (IFN-γ) after ex vivo exposure to peptide pools encompassing ZIKV-prME. The assay results show that splenocytes from ZIKV-prME immunised mice produced a cellular immune response after stimulation with multiple ZIKV-E peptide pools (Figure 2b ). The region(s) of ZIKV-Env, which elicited the strongest cellular response(s) were evaluated by ELISpot assay in a matrix format using 22 peptide pools consisting of 15-mers (overlapping by 9 amino acids) spanning the entire ZIKV-prME protein. Several pools demonstrated elevated T cell responses, with peptide pool 15 exhibiting the highest number of spot-forming units (SFU) ( Figure 2c ). This matrix mapping analysis revealed a dominant prME epitope, 'IRCIGVSNR DFVEGM' (aa167-181). This peptide was confirmed to contain a H2-Db restricted epitope through analysis utilising the Immune Epitope Database Analysis Resource tool (http://tools.iedb.org), which˙supports that in this haplotype the antigen is effectively processed.

Further evaluation of the cellular immunogenicity of the ZIKV-prME vaccine entailed the determination of the polyfunctional properties of CD8 + T cells collected 1 week after the final immunisation. The results show that the ZIKV-prME vaccination increased the proportion of bifunctional vaccine-specific T cells expressing TNF-α (tumour necrosis factor-α) and IFN-γ. Importantly, ZIKV-prME vaccination exhibited a strong ability to expand T cell functionality (Figure 2d ).

In addition, comparative immune studies were performed with optimised plasmids encoding the prME sequence of either a recently identified Brazilian ZIKV strain or of the original MR766 ZIKV strain. Induction of cellular immune responses in mice immunised with either plasmid was measured 1 week after the third vaccination through IFN-γ ELISpot analysis after stimulating splenocytes with the ZIKV-prME peptide pools. The results illustrate that the T-cell responses induced by the consensus ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine construct were consistently higher than those generated by either of these two non-consensus Figure 2 . Characterisation of cellular immune responses in mice following vaccination with the ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine. (a) Timeline of vaccine immunisations and immune analysis used in the study. (b) ELISpot analysis measuring IFN-γ secretion in splenocytes in response to ZIKV-prME immunisation. C57BL/6 mice (n = 4/group) were immunised i.m. three times with 25 μg of either pVax1 or the ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine followed by electroporation. IFN-γ generation, as an indication of induction of cellular immune responses, was measured by an IFN-γ ELISpot assay. The splenocytes harvested 1 week after the third immunisation were incubated in the presence of one of the six peptide pools spanning the entire prM and Env proteins. Results are shown in stacked bar graphs. The data represent the average numbers of SFU (spotforming units) per million splenocytes with values representing the mean responses in each ± s.e.m. (c) Epitope composition of the ZIKV-prME-specific IFN-γ response as determined by stimulation with matrix peptide pools 1 week after the third immunisation. The values represent mean responses in each group ± s.e.m. The experiments were performed independently at least three times with similar results. (d) Flow cytometric analysis of T-cell responses. Immunisation with ZIKV-prME induces higher number of IFN-γ and TNF-α secreting cells when stimulated by ZIKV peptides. One week after the last immunisation with the ZIKV-prME vaccine, splenocytes were cultured in the presence of pooled ZIKV peptides (5 μM) or R10 only. Frequencies of ZIKV peptide-specific IFN-γ and TNF-α secreting cells were measured by flow cytometry. Single function gates were set based on negative control (unstimulated) samples and were placed consistently across samples. The percentage of the total CD8 + T-cell responses are shown. These data are representative of two independent immunisation experiments. IFN, interferon; TNF, tumour necrosis factor; ZIKV-prME, precursor membrane and Env of Zika virus.

plasmid vaccines (Supplementary Figure S1A,B) . Detailed mapping analysis of the cellular responses induced by either the Brazilian or MR766 prME vaccines revealed that both vaccines induced a significant cellular response against the dominant Env-specific CTL epitope as identified in Figure 2b and c for the consensus ZIKV-prME plasmid (data not shown). The consensus immunogen consistently induced more robust responses in these T-cell assays at the same dose and was evaluated further in additional assays.

Generation of a ZIKV recombinant envelope protein At the onset of these studies, there were no available commercial reagents to evaluate specific anti-ZIKV immune responses. Therefore, by necessity, recombinant ZIKV-Env protein (rZIKV-E) was generated to support the assays performed in this study. To generate this reagent, a consensus ZIKV-Env sequence based on the ZIKV-prME vaccine consensus antigen was cloned into a pET30a Escherichia coli expression vector (Supplementary Figure S2A ). The rZIKV-E antigen was produced in E. coli cultures, purified using nickel column chromatography and analysed using SDS-PAGE, which showed overexpressed proteins of the predicted size in lysate from rZIKV-E transfected bacteria that could be detected by western analysis using an anti-His tag antibody (Supplementary Figure S2B ). The sera from mice immunised with the ZIKV-prME vaccine bound to rZIKV-Env that was used as a capture antigen in an ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Supplementary Figure S2C ). A commercial antibody (designated panflavivirus) that reacts to the Env protein of multiple flaviviruses, also bound to rZIKV-E. Western analysis demonstrated that immune sera from ZIKV-prME immunised mice specifically recognised rZIKV-E (Supplementary Figure S2D) . These data indicate that the generated rZIKV-E reacted specifically with immune sera from ZIKV-prME vaccinated mice, thus this recombinant protein was used for further immunogenicity studies.

Induction of functional humoral responses in C57BL/6 mice by the ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine The ability of the consensus ZIKV-prME vaccine to induce humoral immune responses in mice was evaluated. Groups of four C57BL/6 mice were immunised intramuscularly (i.m.) through electroporation-mediated delivery three times at 2-week intervals with 25 μg of either the empty control pVax1 or the consensus ZIKV-prME vaccine plasmids. Sera was obtained from each immunized mouse and tested by ELISA for ZIKV-specific IgG responses using immobilised rZIKV-E as the capture antigen. A significant increase in anti-ZIKV-specific IgG was observed on day 21 with a further boost in the sera IgG levels noted on day 35 ( Figure 3a ). Day 60 sera from vaccinated animals show that Figure 3 . Anti-ZIKV antibody responses are induced by ZIKV-prME vaccination. (a) ELISA analysis measuring binding antibody production (measured by OD450 values) in immunised mice. The C57BL/6 mice (n = 4) were immunised i.m. three times with 25 μg of ZIKV-prME plasmid or pVax1 at 2-week intervals. Binding to rZIKV-E was analysed with sera from animals at different time points (days 21, 35 and 60) post immunisation at various dilutions. The data shown are representative of at least three separate experiments. (b) Endpoint binding titre analysis. Differences in the anti-ZIKV endpoint titres produced in response to the ZIKV-prME immunogen were analysed in sera from immunised animals after each boost. (c) Western blot analysis of rZIKV-E specific antibodies induced by ZIKV-prME immunisation. The rZIKV-E protein was electrophoresed on a 12.5% SDS polyacrylamide gel and analysed by western blot analysis with pooled sera from ZIKV-prME immunised mice (day 35). Binding to rZIKV-E is indicated by the arrowhead. (d) Immunofluorescence analysis of ZIKV specific antibodies induced by ZIKV-prME immunisation. The Vero cells infected with either ZIKV-MR766 or mock infected were stained with pooled sera from ZIKV-prME immunised mice (day 35) followed by an anti-mouse-AF488 secondary antibody for detection. (e) Plaque-reduction neutralisation (PRNT) assay analysis of neutralising antibodies induced by ZIKV-prME immunisation. The serum samples from the ZIKV-prME immunised mice were tested for their ability to neutralise ZIKV infectivity in vitro. PRNT 50 was defined as the serum dilution factor that could inhibit 50% of the input virus. The values in parentheses indicate the PRNT 50 . Control ZIKV-Cap (DNA vaccine expressing the ZIKV capsid protein) and pVax1 sera were used as negative controls. ZIKV-prME, precursor membrane and Env of Zika virus. elevated ZIKV-specific antibody responses were maintained long term following the final boost. Most importantly, sera from vaccinated mice contained very high levels of rZIKV-E-specific antibodies as indicated by the endpoint titres ( Figure 3b ). Additional assessment of the specificity of the vaccine-induced antibodies was performed by screening pooled sera from ZIKV-prME plasmid inoculated mice for its ability to detect rZIKV-E by western analysis (Figure 3c ) and to stain ZIKV (MR766 strain)infected cells in an immunofluorescence assay (Figure 3d ). The results from both these analyses confirmed specificity of the vaccine-induced humoral responses.

Furthermore, ZIKV-specific binding antibody responses were also assessed in mice immunised with plasmids encoding the prME sequences from a Brazilian strain and the MR766 strain described above. Day 35 (1 week after third immunisation) sera from pVax1-and both non-consensus vaccine-immunised mice were analysed by ELISA for binding to rZIKV-E. This analysis indicates that both MR766 and Brazil vaccine plasmids induced significant antibody binding, and that immunisation with the consensus ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine generates an effective humoral response against rZIKV-E (Supplementary Figure S1C , D).

A plaque reduction neutraliszation test (PRNT) assay was performed on pooled day 35 sera from mice immunised with either the control pVax1 plasmid, the consensus ZIKV-prME plasmid vaccine or a consensus ZIKV-C (capsid) plasmid vaccine. The PRNT assay used was a method adapted from a previously described technique for analysing dengue virus, West Nile virus and other flaviviruses. 16 As shown in Figure 3e , ZIKV-prME vaccination yielded significant neutralisation response with anti-ZIKV reciprocal PRNT 50 dilution titres (inverse of the serum dilution at which 50% of the control ZIKV infection was inhibited) of 456 ± 5, whereas the PRNT50 of sera from ZIKV-Cap DNA vaccine immunized mice was 33 ± 6 which was minimally higher than that of sera from pVax1 control plasmid vaccinated animals (titre = 15 ± 2).

Immune responses and protection against ZIKV in mice lacking the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR − / − ) following immunisation with the ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine Mechanisms of ZIKV-induced disease and immunity are poorly defined, and the protective versus the hypothetical pathogenic nature of the immune response to ZIKV infection is as yet unclear. 17 Most strains of mice are resistant to ZIKV infection, however, mice lacking IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR − / − ) were found to be susceptible to infection and disease with most succumbing within 6-7 days post challenge. 18 The ability of the consensus ZIKV-prME plasmid vaccine to induce cellular and humoral immune responses in this mouse strain was investigated. Five to six week old female IFNAR − / − mice (n = 4) were immunised i.m., with electroporation-mediated delivery, three times at 2-week intervals with either the control pVax1 plasmid or ZIKV-prME vaccine plasmid vaccine. The serum was collected from immunised mice at days 0, 14, 21, and 35, and splenocytes were harvested from mice 1 week following the final immunisation (day 35). The splenocytes from vaccine-immunised mice produced a clear cellular immune response as indicated by levels of SFU per 10 6 cells in an ELISpot assay (Supplementary Figure S3A) . The results from ELISA analysis, using rZIKV-E as a capture antigen, show detectable anti-ZIKV serum IgG by day 14 (titres of~1:1,000) and these levels were boosted with subsequent vaccinations with binding antibody titres reaching at least 1:100,000 (Supplementary Figure S3B ,C). By comparison, the PRNT 50 titre for the day 35 postimmunisation samples was 1:60 (data not shown). The results indicate that IFNAR − / − mice immunised with the consensus ZIKV-prME vaccine are capable of generating anti-ZIKV cellular and humoral immune responses supporting further study in this model of putative vaccine effects in a pathogenic challenge.

ZIKV-specific functional cellular and humoral responses elicited by the ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine in non-human primates NHPs were immunised by intradermal immunisation using intradermal electroporation, based on recent studies showing potent immune responses in a intradermal format. 19, 20 Rhesus macaques (RM; n = 5/group) were administered 2.0 mg of vaccine plasmid intradermally with electroporation, with each animal vaccinated twice 4 weeks apart. The sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected at day 0 (preimmunisation) and week 6 (2 weeks post second immunisation). ELISpot analysis of pre-immunisation and week 6 PBMCs ex vivo stimulated with the ZIKV-prME peptide pools showed that ZIKV-prME immunisation induced robust anti-ZIKV T cell responses in RM (Figure 4a) .

Specific anti-ZIKV antibody responses in sera from vaccinated RM were assessed by ELISA. At week 6, rZIKV-E-specific binding antibodies were detectable in animals vaccinated with ZIKV-prME ( Figure 4b ). Endpoint titres were determined for each animal at week 2 (after 1 immunisation) and week 6 (after 2 immunisations; Figure 4c ). The ELISA results were confirmed by western blot analysis using RM sera from the individual vaccinated animals ( Figure 4d ). The neutralisation activity of the antibodies generated in RM at week 6 was evaluated by a PRNT 50 assay. All the vaccinated monkeys had significant neutralisation activity with anti-ZIKV reciprocal PRNT 50 dilution titres ranging from 161 to 1380 (average 501 ± 224 standard error of the mean; Figure 4e ). PRNT titres did not directly correlate with ELISA titre (data not shown).

The ability of the immune sera from vaccinated RM to block ZIKV infection of Vero cells, neuroblastoma (SK-N-SH) or neural progenitor (U-87MG) cells in vitro was examined by IFA. ZIKV strains (MR766 or PR209) were pre-incubated in sera or diluted RM-immune sera and added to monolayers of each cell type. Protection against ZIKV infection and disease in IFNAR − / − mice following ZIKV-prME immunisation In exploratory studies, 5-6-week-old IFNAR (− / − ) mice (n = 10) were challenged with 1 ×10 6 plaque-forming units (PFU) of the ZIKV-PR209 isolate, administered by either subcutaneous (s.c.); intraperitoneal (i.p.); intracranial (i.c); or intravenous (i.v.) routes. After the challenge, all the animals were monitored for clinical signs of infection, which included routine measurement of body weight as well as inspection for other signs of a moribund condition such as hind limb weakness and paralysis. No change in the general appearance of the mice was observed during the first 4 days after inoculation. However, after the fourth day, the mice in each of the groups demonstrated reduced overall activity, decreased mobility and a hunched posture often accompanied by hind-limb weakness, decreased water intake and obvious weight loss. The animals succumbed to the infection between day 6 and day 8 regardless of the route of viral challenge (Supplementary Figure  S5A -E). On the basis of these data, the subsequent studies to evaluate ZIKV-prME-mediated protection in this model used the s.c. route for challenge.

The protective efficacy of the ZIKV-prME vaccine was next evaluated in this IFNAR − / − mouse model. Two groups of mice (n = 10) were immunised (25 μg of vaccine) by the i.m. route, through electroporation-mediated delivery with the ZIKV-prME vaccine. Also, two groups of 10 mice were immunised by the i.m. route through electroporation-mediated delivery with the control pVax1 vector. The immunisations were performed two times, two weeks apart, and all the animals were challenged on day 21

(1 week post second immunisation). One set of control and vaccinated mice received 1 × 10 6 PFU of ZIKV-PR209 by the s.c. route and the other set of each group were challenged with a total of 2 × 10 6 PFU ZIKV-PR209 by the s.c. route. At 3 weeks post challenge, 100% of all ZIKV-prME vaccinated animals survived, whereas only 30% of the single-or 10% of double-dose challenged controls survived (Figures 5a,b) . In all the challenges, the vaccinated animals were without signs of disease including no . Induction of ZIKV specific cellular immune responses following ZIKV-prME vaccination of non-human primates (NHPs). (a) ELISpot analysis measuring IFN-γ secretion in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in response to ZIKV-prME immunisation. Rhesus macaques were immunised intradermally with 2 mg of ZIKV-prME plasmid at weeks 0 and 4 administered as 1 mg at each of two sites, with immunisation immediately followed by intradermal electroporation. PBMCs were isolated pre-immunisation and at week 6 and were used for the ELISPOT assay to detect IFN-γ-secreting cells in response to stimulation with ZIKV-prME peptides as described in the 'Materials and Methods' section. The number of IFN-γ producing cells obtained per million PBMCs against six peptide pools encompassing the entire prME protein is shown. The values represent mean responses in each group (n = 5) ± s.e.m. (b) Detection of ZIKV-prME-specific antibody responses following DNA vaccination. Anti-ZIKV IgG antibodies were measured pre-immunisation and at week 6 by ELISA. (c) Endpoint ELISA titres for anti ZIKV-Env antibodies are shown following the first and second immunisations. (d) Western blot analysis using week 6 RM immune sera demonstrated binding to recombinant Env protein. (e) PRNT activity of serum from RM immunised with ZIKV-prME. Pre-immunisation and week 6 immune sera from individual monkeys were tested by plaque-reduction neutralisation (PRNT) assay for their ability to neutralise ZIKV infectivity in vitro.

evidence of weight loss (Figures 5c,d) . The infection of control mice with ZIKV-PR209 virus produced a marked decrease in body weight along with decreased mobility, hunched posture, hindlimb knuckle walking and/or paralysis of one or both hind limbs (Figures 5e,f) .

The potential ability of a single immunisation with the ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine to protect IFNAR − / − mice from ZIKV challenge was evaluated. Groups of 10 mice were immunised i.m. with electroporation once with either control plasmid or ZIKV-prME vaccine and challenged 2 weeks later with a total dose of 2 × 10 6 PFU ZIKV-PR209. Three weeks post challenge, 100% of the ZIKV-prME vaccinated animals survived, whereas only 10% of the control animals survived (Figure 6a ). To determine gross histopathological changes, brain tissue was sectioned into 5 μmthick sagittal sections, stained for nuclear structures and counterstained for cytoplasmic structures using eosin (Figure 6b ). The mice were killed at day 7 or 8 post challenge for the analysis of histology and viral load. The ZIKV infection caused severe brain pathology in the mice. The unvaccinated control (pVax1) mice brain sections showed nuclear fragments within neutrophils (Figures 6b-i) ; perivascular cuffing of vessels within the cortex, lymphocyte infiltration and degenerating cells of the cerebral cortex (Figure 6b -ii and iii) and degenerating neurons within the hippocampus (Figure 6b-iv) . In contrast, the ZIKV-prME vaccinated animals presented with normal histopathology in brain tissues (Figures 6b-v and vi) supporting that protective responses induced by immunisation with the synthetic ZIKA-prME vaccine could limit viral-induced disease in the brain. This observation demonstrates the potential for vaccination to protect the brain in this model. Consistent with the amelioration of body weight loss and mobility impairment in vaccinated mice following ZIKV challenge, a significantly lower viral load was noted in the blood (Figure 6c ) and brain (Figure 6d ) of the ZIKV-prME vaccinated animals compared with viral challenged pVax1 vaccinated animals in the high (2 × 10 6 PFU) dose challenge groups. Taken together, these data illustrate that ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine-mediated immune responses can protect mice against ZIKV challenge.

Passive transfer of anti-ZIKV immune sera protects mice against ZIKV infection Next, we tested whether transfer of immune sera from ZIKV-prME vaccinated RM could prevent ZIKV-mediated pathogenesis in IFNAR − / − mice. To this end, 150 μg equivalent IgG (PRNT 50 ≈1/160) from week 6 RM were adoptively transferred into IFNAR − / − mice 1 day after the ZIKV viral challenge. Two groups of control mice were included, one group receiving pre-immune sera from RM and the other group receiving phosphate-buffered saline Figure 6 . Single immunisation with the ZIKV-prME vaccine provides protection against ZIKV challenge in mice lacking the type I interferon α, β receptor. Mice were immunised once and challenged with 2 × 10 6 plaque-forming units of ZIKV-PR209, two weeks post immunisation. The survival curves depict 10 mice per group per experiment (a). The ZIKV-prME vaccine prevented ZIKV-induced neurological abnormalities in the mouse brain (b). Brain sections from pVax1 and ZIKV-prME vaccinated groups were collected 7-8 days after challenge and stained with H&E (haematoxylin and eosin) for histology. The sections taken from representative, unprotected pVax1 control animals shows pathology. (i): nuclear fragments within neuropils of the cerebral cortex (inset shows higher magnification and arrows to highlight nuclear fragments); (ii): perivascular cuffing of vessels within the cortex, lymphocyte infiltration and degenerating cells; (iii): perivascular cuffing, cellular degeneration and nuclear fragments within the cerebral cortex; and (iv): degenerating neurons within the hippocampus (arrows). An example of normal tissue from ZIKV-prME vaccinated mice appeared to be within normal limits (v and vi). (PBS). The mice that received PBS or control sera lost 15 to 25% of their original body weight during the course of infection, and all died 6-8 days post infection. When vaccine immune sera from RMs were transferred to infection-susceptible mice, the animals lost weight on day 3 and 4, but subsequently regained it beginning on day 5 and 80% ultimately survived infectious challenge (Figure 7a ) demonstrating the ability of the NHP sera transfer to confer protection against clinical manifestations of ZIKV infection following viral challenge (Figure 7b ). In repeated experiments performed to evaluate the efficacy of immune serum transfer in protection against challenge with ZIKV, the survival among ZIKV-prME immune sera recipients ranged from 80 to 100%. These studies show that anti-ZIKV vaccine immune sera had the ability to confer significant protection against ZIKV infection in the absence of an acquired adaptive anti-ZIKV immune response.

Serious concerns have been raised by the recent spread of ZIKV and its associated pathogenesis in humans. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for this emerging infectious agent. Very recently, a collection of experimental ZIKV vaccines have been shown to lower viral load post challenge in nonpathogenic animal infection models. 21, 22 These data are encouraging. In this regard, it is important to examine additional novel vaccine approaches targeting ZIKA in additional models that similar to susceptible humans, might show disease. Here we evaluated a synthetic DNA vaccine, designed to express a novel consensus ZIKV-prM and E antigen, for immunogenicity following electroporation-enhanced immunisation in mice and non-human primates. We observed that ZIKV-prME DNA vaccination was immunogenic and generated antigen-specific T cells and binding and neutralising antibodies in both mice and NHPs. Uniquely, the NHPs were immunised with ZIKV-prME through electroporation by the intradermal route, which uses lower voltage and a smaller transfection area than i.m. electroporation, as we have recently described. 23 Further study of such approaches may provide advantages in clinical settings.

The ZIKV-prME consensus construct includes a designed change of the potential NXS/T motif, which removes a putative glycosylation site. Deletion of glycosylation at this site has been correlated with improved binding of EDE1 type bnAbs (broadly neutralising antibodies) against ZIKV-E protein. 24 The antibody responses induced by the consensus ZIKV-prME appear as robust or in some cases superior in magnitude to those elicited by similarly developed MR766 ZIKV-prME and Brazil ZIKV-prME vaccines. These constructs were sequence matched with the original ZIKV-MR766 isolate or a recently circulating ZIKV strain from Brazil, respectively. While supportive, further study will provide more insight into the effects of such incorporated designed changes on induced immune responses.

As there are few pathogenic challenge models for ZIKV, we compared the putative protective nature of the immune responses of the ZIKV-prME vaccine in C57BL/6 and IFNAR − / − mice. Both strains of mice responded with a robust humoral immune response when immunised with ZIKV-prME. T-cell responses were also induced, but appear to be more robust in wild-type C57BL/6 compared with those induced in the IFNAR − / − animals, supporting a partial defect in innate to adaptive immunity transition as expected owing to the knock-out phenotype in the mouse. However, based on the induction of antigen specific immunity, the model was useful for evaluation of the impact of the vaccine on both infection and pathogenesis. A single vaccination with ZIKV-prME in IFNAR − / − mice was protective against disease and death in this model, including protection of neuro-pathogenesis. Flavivirus-neutralising antibodies directed against the Env antigen are thought to have a key role in protection against disease, an idea supported directly by passive antibody transfer experiments in animal models and indirectly by epidemiological data from prospective studies in geographical areas that are prone to mosquito-borne viral infections. 3, 7, 8 Although immunisation of IFNAR − / − mice with the ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine as well as serum transfer from immunised NHPs were protective in this murine model, the IFNAR − / − vaccinated as opposed to serum-transferred mice exhibited greater control of weight loss as an indication of control of pathogenesis. Although additional studies are needed, this result potentially suggests a role for the T-cell response in this aspect of protection in this model. In addition, we observed that control IFNAR − / − mice who recovered from challenge remain viral positive by PCR for at least several weeks, suggesting an additional benefit of vaccination in limiting potential sexual or vector borne transmission. Our study extends prior findings and supports the potential of vaccination and, in this case this synthetic DNA vaccination, to impact prevention of disease in a susceptible host. were maintained in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Gibco-Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin and passaged upon confluence. Both ZIKV virus strains MR766 (a kind gift from Dr Susan Weiss) and PR209 (Bioqual, MD) were amplified in Vero cells and stocks were titred by standard plaque assay on Vero cells. Five-to six-week-old female C57BL/6 (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and IFNAR − / − (MMRRC repository-The Jackson Laboratory) mice were housed and treated/ vaccinated in a temperature-controlled, light-cycled facility in accordance with the National Institutes of Health, Wistar and the Public Health Agency of Canada IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) guidelines.

The RMs were housed and treated/vaccinated at Bioqual, MD, USA. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations described in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the NIH, the Office of Animal Welfare, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. All animal immunisation work was approved by the Bioqual Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Bioqual is accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. All the procedures were carried out under ketamine anaesthesia by trained personnel under the supervision of veterinary staff, and all the efforts were made to protect the welfare of the animals and to minimise animal suffering in accordance with the 'Weatherall report for the use of non-human primates' recommendations. The animals were housed in adjoining individual primate cages allowing social interactions, under controlled conditions of humidity, temperature and light (12 h light/12 h dark cycles). Food and water were available ad libitum. The animals were monitored twice daily and fed commercial monkey chow, treats and fruits twice daily by trained personnel.

The ZIKV-prME plasmid DNA constructs encodes full-length precursor of membrane (prM) plus Env (E) and a construct encoding a consensus Capsid proteins were synthesised. A consensus strategy was used and the consensus sequences were determined by the alignment of current ZIKV prME protein sequences. The vaccine insert was genetically optimised (i.e., codon and RNA optimisation) for enhanced expression in humans and an IgE leader sequence was added to facilitate expression. The construct was synthesised commercially (Genscript, NJ, USA), and then subcloned into a modified pVax1 expression vector under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter as described before. 25 The final construct is named ZIKV-prME vaccine and the control plasmid backbone is pVax1. In addition, a number of other matched DNA constructs encoding the prM and E genes from MR766 (DQ859059.1) and a 2016 Brazilian (AMA12084.1) outbreak strain were also designed, for further evaluation. Large-scale amplifications of DNA constructs were carried out by Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA) and purified plasmid DNA was formulated in water for immunisations. The size of the DNA inserts was confirmed via agarose gel electrophoresis. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by multiple alignment with ClustalW using MEGA version 5 software. 25 DNA immunisations and electroporation-mediated delivery enhancement Female C57BL/6 mice (6-8 weeks old) and IFNAR − / − mice (5-6 weeks old) were immunised with 25 μg of DNA in a total volume of 20 or 30 μl of water delivered into the tibialis anterior muscle with in vivo electroporation delivery. In vivo electroporation was delivered with the CELLECTRA adaptive constant current electroporation device (Inovio Pharmaceuticals) at the same site immediately following DNA injection. A three-pronged CELLECTRA minimally invasive device was inserted~2 mm into the muscle. Square-wave pulses were delivered through a triangular threeelectrode array consisting of 26-gauge solid stainless steel electrodes and two constant current pulses of 0.1 Amps were delivered for 52 msec/pulse separated by a 1 s delay. Further protocols for the use of electroporation have been previously described in detail. 26 The mice were immunised three times at 2-week intervals and killed 1 week after the final immunisation. Blood and splenocytes were collected after each immunisation for the analysis of cellular and humoral immune responses. 25 Rhesus macaque immunogenicity studies: five rhesus macaques were immunised intradermally at two sites two times at 4-week intervals with 2 mg ZIKV-prME vaccine. Electroporation was delivered at 0.2 Amps immediately using the same device described for mouse immunisations.

For in vitro expression studies, transfections were performed using the GeneJammer reagent, following the manufacturer's protocols (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Briefly, the cells were grown to 50% confluence in a 35 mm dish and transfected with 1 μg of ZIKV-prME vaccine. The cells were collected 2 days after transfection, washed twice with PBS and lysed with cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA). Western Blot was used to verify the expression of the ZIKV-prME protein from the harvested cell lysate and the immune specificity of the mouse and RM serum through the use of either pan-flavivirus antibody or immune sera from the ZIKV-prME vaccinated mice, as described previously. 25 In brief, 3-12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gels (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were loaded with 5 μg or 1 μg of ZIKV Env recombinant protein (rZIKV-E); transfected cell lysates or supernatant and the Odyssey protein Molecular Weight Marker (Product # 928-40000). The gels were run at 200 V for 50 min in MOPS buffer. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using the iBlot 2 Gel Transfer Device (Life Technologies). The membranes were blocked in PBS Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. To detect vaccine expression, the anti-Flavivirus group antigen (MAB10216-Clone D1-4G2-4-15) antibody was diluted 1:500 and the immune serum from mice and RM was diluted 1:50 in Odyssey blocking buffer with 0.2% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and incubated with the membranes overnight at 4°C. The membranes were washed with PBST and then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IRDye680CW; LI-COR Biosciences) for mouse serum and flavivirus antibody; and goat anti-human IRDye800CW (LI-COR Biosciences) for RM sera at 1:15,000 dilution for mouse sera for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the membranes were imaged on the Odyssey infrared imager (LI-COR Biosciences).

For the immunofluorescence assay, the cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with 5 μg of ZIKV-prME vaccine. Two days after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Nonspecific binding was then blocked with normal goat serum diluted in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. The slides were then washed in PBS for 5 min and subsequently incubated with sera from immunised mice or RM at a 1:100 dilutions overnight at 4°C. The slides were washed as described above and incubated with appropriate secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG-AF488; for mouse serum and goat anti-human IgG-AF488 for RM serum; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) at 1:200 dilutions at room temperature for 1 h. After washing, Flouroshield mounting media with DAPI (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) was added to stain the nuclei of all cells. After which, coverslips were mounted and the slides were observed under a microscope (EVOS Cell Imaging Systems; Life Technologies). 25 . In addition, Vero, SK-N-SH or U87-MB cells were grown on four-chamber tissue culture treated glass slides and infected at MOI of 0.01 with ZIKV-MR766 or PR209 that were preincubated with/without RM immune sera (1:200) , and stained at 4 days post ZIKV infection using pan-flavivirus antibody as described. 17 Histopathology analysis For histopathology, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded brain tissue was sectioned into 5 μm thick sagittal sections, placed on Superfrost microscope slides (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA) and backed at 37°C overnight. The sections were deparaffinised using two changes of xylene and rehydrated by immersing in 100%, 90% and then 70% ethanol. The sections were stained for nuclear structures using Harris haematoxylin (Surgipath, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) for 2 min followed by differentiation in 1% acid alcohol (Surgipath) and treatment with Scott's tap water for 2 min. Subsequently, the sections were counterstained for cytoplasmic structures using eosin (Surgipath) for 2 min. The slides were dehydrated with 70%, 90% and 100% ethanol, cleared in xylene and mounted using Permount (Fisher Scientific).

Single-cell suspensions of splenocytes were prepared from all the mice. Briefly, the spleens from mice were collected individually in 5 ml of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS (R10), then processed with a Stomacher 80 paddle blender (A.J. Seward and Co. Ltd.) for 30 s on high speed. The processed spleen samples were filtered through 45 mm nylon filters and then centrifuged at 1,500g for 10 min at 4°C. The cell pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of ACK (ammonium-chloride-potassium) lysis buffer ZIKA virus prM envelope-based DNA vaccination K Muthumani et al (Life Technologies) for 5 min at room temperature, and PBS was then added to stop the reaction. The samples were again centrifuged at 1,500g for 10 min at 4°C. The cell pellets were resuspended in R10 and then passed through a 45 mm nylon filter before use in ELISpot assay and flow cytometric analysis. 25 For RM, blood (20 ml at each time point) was collected in EDTA tubes and the PBMCs were isolated using a standard Ficoll-hypaque procedure with Accuspin tubes (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Five millilitres of blood was also collected into sera tubes at each time point for sera isolation.

Flow cytometry and intracellular cytokine staining assay The splenocytes were added to a 96-well plate (2 × 10 6 /well) and were stimulated with ZIKV-prME pooled peptides for 5 h at 37°C/5% CO 2 in the presence of Protein Transport Inhibitor Cocktail (brefeldin A and monensin; eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). The cell stimulation cocktail (plus protein transport inhibitors; PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate), ionomycin, brefeldin A and monensin; eBioscience) was used as a positive control and R10 media as the negative control. All the cells were then stained for surface and intracellular proteins as described by the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). Briefly, the cells were washed in FACS buffer (PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide and 1% FBS) before surface staining with flourochrome-conjugated antibodies. The cells were washed with FACS buffer, fixed and permeabilised using the BD Cytofix/Ctyoperm TM (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol followed by intracellular staining. The following antibodies were used for surface staining: LIVE/DEAD Fixable Violet Dead Cell stain kit (Invitrogen), CD19 (V450; clone 1D3; BD Biosciences) CD4 (FITC; clone RM4-5; eBioscience), CD8 (APC-Cy7; clone 53-6.7; BD Biosciences); CD44 (BV711; clone IM7; BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA). For intracellular staining, the following antibodies were used: IFN-γ (APC; clone XMG1.2; BioLegend), TNF-α (PE; clone MP6-XT22; eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA), CD3 (PerCP/ Cy5.5; clone 145-2C11; BioLegend); IL-2 (PeCy7; clone JES6-SH4; eBioscience). All the data were collected using a LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analysed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA).

Briefly, 96-well ELISpot plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) were coated with anti-mouse IFN-γ capture Ab (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and incubated overnight at 4°C. The following day, the plates were washed with PBS and blocked for 2 h with PBST+1% BSA. Two hundred thousand splenocytes from immunised mice were added to each well and incubated overnight at 37°C in 5% CO 2 in the presence of media alone (negative control), media with PMA/ionomycin (positive control) or media with peptide pools (1 μg/ml) consisting of 15-mers overlapping by nine amino acids and spanning the length of the ZIKV prME protein (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ, USA). After 24 h, the cells were washed and then incubated overnight at 4°C with biotinylated anti-mouse IFN-γ Ab (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (R&D Systems) was added to each well after washing and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The plate was washed, and then 5-bromo-4-chloro-3′indolylphosphate p-toluidine salt and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (chromogen colour reagent; R&D Systems) was added. Last, the plates were rinsed with distilled water, dried at room temperature and SFU were quantified by an automated ELISpot reader (CTL Limited, Shaker Heights, OH, USA), and the raw values were normalised to SFU per million splenocytes. For RM samples, the ELISPOT PRO for monkey IFN-γ kit (MABTECH, Cincinnati, OH, USA) was used as described by the manufacturer; two hundred thousand PBMCs were stimulated with peptide pools; and the plates were washed and spots were developed and counted as described before. 25 Humoral immune response: antibody-binding ELISA An ELISA was used to determine the titres of mouse and RM sera as previously described. 25 Briefly, 1 μg of purified rZIKV-E protein was used to coat 96-well microtiter plates (Nalgene Nunc International, Naperville, IL, USA) at 4°C overnight. After blocking with 10% FBS in PBS for at least an hour, the plates were washed four times with 0.05% PBST (Tween20 in PBS). Serum samples from immunised mice and RMs were serially diluted in 1% FBS, added to the plates, then incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were again washed four times in 0.05% PBST, then incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) at a 1:35,000 dilution for mouse sera for 1 h at room temperature. For RM sera, anti-monkey IgG HRP (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA) was used at a 1:5,000 dilutions for 1 h at room temperature. The bound enzyme was detected by adding SIGMAFAST OPD (o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride) substrate solution according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The reaction was stopped after 15 min with the addition of 1 N H 2 SO 4 . The optical density at 450 nm was read on a Synergy plate reader. All the mouse and RM serum samples were assayed in duplicate. Endpoint titres were determined using the method described by Frey et al. 27 Neutralisation (PRNT 50 ) assay

The PRNT involving MR766 and Vero cells was described previously. 28 Briefly, heat-inactivated mouse or RM sera were serially diluted in serumfree DMEM (1:10 to 1: 1280) and incubated with an equal volume of ZIKV MR766 (100 PFU) at 37°C for 2 h. The mixtures were added to the confluent layers of Vero cells and left at 37°C for adsorption for 2 h. A 2 × DMEM media:soft-agar (1:1) overlay was added over cells and the plate was incubated for 5 days at 37°C. The agar overlay was removed and the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with 1 × PBS, stained with crystal violet solution, washed with 1 × PBS and the plates were left to dry. The plaques in assays done in 24-well plates were scanned with an automated Immunospot reader (CTL Limited), and the plaques in sample wells and in negative control (DMEM only) and positive control (100 PFU MR766 ZIKV virus only) wells were counted using the automated software provided with the ELISpot reader. The percentage plaque reduction was calculated as follows: % reduction = 100 × {1 − (average number of plaques for each dilution/average number of plaques in positive control wells)}. GraphPad Prism software was used to perform nonlinear regression analysis of % plaque reduction versus a log transformation of each individual serum dilution to facilitate linear interpolation of actual 50% PRNT titres at peak post vaccination response. The medians and interquartile ranges at 50% neutralisation were calculated for each neutralisation target overall and by vaccine treatment group; the geometric mean titres were also calculated. The titres represent the reciprocal of the highest dilution resulting in a 50% reduction in the number of plaques.

ZIKV challenge studies in IFNAR − / − mice For the ZIKA challenge studies, IFNAR − / − mice (n = 10/group) were immunised once or twice with the ZIKA-prME vaccine or pVax1. The mice were challenge with either 1 × 10 6 PFU or 2 × 10 6 PFU ZIKV-PR209 virus on day 15 (single immunisation group) or day 21 one week after the second immunisation (two immunisation groups). Post challenge, the animals were weighed and body temperature was measured daily by a subcutaneously located temperature chip. In addition, they were observed for clinical signs of disease twice daily (decreased mobility; hunched posture; hind-limb knuckle walking (partial paralysis), paralysis of one hind limb or both hind limbs) and blood was drawn for viral load determination. The criteria for killing on welfare grounds consisted of 20% weight loss or paralysis in one or both hind limbs.

The brains from treated mice were immersed in RNAlater (Ambion, Waltham, MA, USA) 4°C for 1 week, then stored at − 80°C. The brain tissue was then weighed and homogenised in 600 μl RLT buffer in a 2 ml cryovial using a TissueLyser (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) with a stainless steel bead for 6 min at 30 cycles/s. Viral RNA was also isolated from blood with the RNeasy Plus mini kit (Qiagen). A ZIKV specific real-time RT-PCR assay was utilised for the detection of viral RNA from subject animals. RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using the primers ZIKV 835 and ZIKV 911c and probe ZIKV 860FAM with the TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). A standard curve was generated in parallel for each plate and used for the quantification of viral genome copy numbers. The StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) software version 2.3 was used to calculate the cycle threshold (Ct) values, and a Ct value ⩽ 38 for at least one of the replicates was considered positive, as previously described. 29 Pre-bleeds were negative in this assay.

Differences in fold increases in antibody titres were compared using Mann-Whitney analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad, Prism 4 ZIKA virus prM envelope-based DNA vaccination K Muthumani et al (Graphpad software, Inc. San Diego, CA, USA). For all the analyses, Po0.05 was considered to be significant. Log 10 transformations were applied to end point binding ELISA titres and whole-virus PRNT 50 titres.

A new look at an old virus: patterns of mutation accumulation in the human H1N1 influenza virus since 1918

Background: The H1N1 influenza A virus has been circulating in the human population for over 95 years, first manifesting itself in the pandemic of 1917-1918. Initial mortality was extremely high, but dropped exponentially over time. Influenza viruses have high mutation rates, and H1N1 has undergone significant genetic changes since 1918. The exact nature of H1N1 mutation accumulation over time has not been fully explored. Methods: We have made a comprehensive historical analysis of mutational changes within H1N1 by examining over 4100 fully-sequenced H1N1 genomes. This has allowed us to examine the genetic changes arising within H1N1 from 1918 to the present. Results: We document multiple extinction events, including the previously known extinction of the human H1N1 lineage in the 1950s, and an apparent second extinction of the human H1N1 lineage in 2009. These extinctions appear to be due to a continuous accumulation of mutations. At the time of its disappearance in 2009, the human H1N1 lineage had accumulated over 1400 point mutations (more than 10% of the genome), including approximately 330 non-synonymous changes (7.4% of all codons). The accumulation of both point mutations and non-synonymous amino acid changes occurred at constant rates (μ = 14.4 and 2.4 new mutations/ year, respectively), and mutations accumulated uniformly across the entire influenza genome. We observed a continuous erosion over time of codon-specificity in H1N1, including a shift away from host (human, swine, and bird [duck]) codon preference patterns. Conclusions: While there have been numerous adaptations within the H1N1 genome, most of the genetic changes we document here appear to be nonadaptive, and much of the change appears to be degenerative. We suggest H1N1 has been undergoing natural genetic attenuation, and that significant attenuation may even occur during a single pandemic. This process may play a role in natural pandemic cessation and has apparently contributed to the exponential decline in mortality rates over time, as seen in all major human influenza strains. These findings may be relevant to the development of strategies for managing influenza pandemics and strain evolution.

At the close of World War I, the H1N1 influenza A virus swept the world [1] . During the 1917-1918 pandemic, approximately 40% of the human population was infected, with a death rate above 2%. It is estimated that this virus killed more people than died in the world war that was just then ending. Mortality rates have dramatically declined since then [2] , but the H1N1 flu has persisted. As a zoonotic pathogen, the influenza virus is able to infect multiple species. It is generally thought that aquatic waterfowl are a primary natural influenza reservoir [3] , where there are usually no clinical symptoms [4] , and where low level transmission probably perpetuates the viral pool [5] . All 14 influenza subtypes are maintained in waterfowl [5] .

H1N1 has had an interesting history. Derivatives of the original virus circulated in humans and swine until 1957, when the human strain went extinct. In 1977, a version identical to those circulating in NE Europe in the early 1950s reappeared in Anshan, China and subsequently spread across the world [5] [6] [7] . In 2009, a swine H1N1 jumped to the human population, causing a widespread pandemic. This has increased concern that H1N1 might mutate into a more virulent form. However, since the pandemic of 1917, this has not happened. In fact, H1N1-related human mortality has declined very dramatically and very systematically [2] . Apart from the 1917 pandemic, H1N1 has failed to cause any severe global pandemic, and human H1N1 essentially went extinct from 1957-1977. Since its re-introduction, it has remained a relatively minor cause of influenza mortality [2] . This applies also to the 2009 outbreak, which caused relatively few deaths in those areas with good reporting systems in place [8] .

It is therefore reasonable to ask if the striking reduction in H1N1 mortality might be due, in part, to natural attenuation resulting from deleterious mutation accumulation. Herd immunity is undoubtedly an important factor in reduced H1N1 mortality since 1918, but this may not be sufficient to explain the continuous decline in H1N1-related mortality over multiple human generations or the eventual extinction of the viral strain. Likewise, improved medical treatments, such as antibiotic treatment for flu-related pneumonia, were certainly a significant factor reducing H1N1 mortality, but these do not appear to fully explain the nature of the pattern of mortality decline seen for H1N1. For example, the exponential decline in mortality began before the invention of antibiotic treatment.

The literature suggests RNA viruses should be inherently subject to mutational degeneration [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . This includes the bacteriophage MS2 [14] , the tobacco etch virus [15] , HIV [16] [17] [18] [19] , dengue virus type-2 [20] , Ebola [21, 22] , and SARS [23, 24] . Some have suggested that intentionally increasing the rate of mutation accumulation ("lethal mutagenesis") may be a way to control viral epidemics by hastening strain extinction [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . There is some long-term historical evidence that supports the concept of natural viral attenuation through mutation accumulation [2] , and theoretical studies using numerical simulation strongly support the concept of natural and accelerated genetic attenuation of RNA viruses [13] .

The influenza genome consists of eight RNA segments totaling over 13,100 nucleotides. These code for up to eleven distinct proteins, two with alternate reading frames and one through alternate splicing. Each of the eight RNA segments has its own history of reassortment, inheritance, and mutation [5] . In the same way, each of the major serotypes (e.g., H1N1, H2N2, H3N2) has its own rate of mutation and history of reassortment. Almost all of the influenza genome is protein coding, and 5.7% (749 nucleotides) of the genome codes for two protein products simultaneously (Table 1) . Currently, there are thousands of fully-sequenced influenza genomes available in public databases, including a reconstructed version of a 1918 H1N1 genome. Most of these have collection dates and lineage information associated with them. Given this large body of data, it becomes feasible to test the attenuation model using mutation accumulation rates, non-synonymous amino acid changes, changing dN/dS ratios, changing transition/transversions ratios, and changes in codon specificity over time.

Previous genetic studies examining the history of the influenza virus have performed extensive phylogenetic analyses of influenza genomes [8, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . They have shown considerable nucleotide diversity among circulating strains, given clear evidence for adaptive selection of antigenic variants [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] , and have shown that most of the major innovations within the flu genome have occurred via reassortment [5] , by which one flu strain has recombined with another strain and obtained a segment of RNA from the second strain.

Influenza phylogenies are odd, in some respects, consisting of one main trunk with many short and short-lived side branches [36, 39, 42, 43] . There are several factors that influence strain diversity, including the mutation rate, selection, drift, and crossimmunity-mediated competition between strains [39] . Feguson, et al. [39] felt that strain-transcending immunity was essential in restricting viral diversity. Ito, et al. [42] thought that the many side branches died out because they could not compete with the main-trunk lineage viruses. Others have noted the temporal extinction of circulating strains upon the introduction of new strains or serotypes [5] . Whatever the reason, a hierarchy of strain robustness is evident in the history of influenza viruses.

While phylogenetic studies can build robust family trees, they do so by focusing only on a limited number of "informative" genomic locations [44] . Even though the influenza genome is broken into eight separate RNAs, unless an individual is infected with two strains simultaneously (providing an opportunity for reassortment), all eight sections are inherited as a set in a form of linkage [36] . Thus, neutral and slightly deleterious mutations are carried along with those mutations under positive or purifying selection. This gives us enough information to make many phylogenetic inferences, and we have a wealth of data telling us the history of the various viral lines, but these phylogenetic techniques ignore genetic change within a larger portion of the genome in order to focus on the phylogenetically-informative sites. There is abundant evidence for multiple substitutions in specific places that are, in turn, sites of active selection [42] , but what about the rest of the genome? Fitch, et al. [36] noted that the main strategy of influenza viruses was to outrun the immune system of the host by maintaining a high mutation rate. They wondered "why such a virus does not accumulate so many deleterious mutations as to die of its own ineptitude." They further wondered if the only reason influenza viruses continued to circulate in mammalian species was because of a sort of "gene therapy" through reassortment with stronger, less mutated avian viruses.

The present study is an attempt to elucidate more fully the nature of mutational change in this historically important human pathogen.

Accession numbers for all available complete flu genomes were obtained from the Influenza Research Database [45] as of June 1, 2012. This list was then compared to those available at FluGenome.org [46] . To create a list of the 2009-2010 H1N1 outbreak versions, we used the collated genome list from Kedwaii, et al. [8] . Using these two accession lists, sequence data were obtained from GenBank [47]. We removed non-human/swine, non-H1N1, and incomplete genomes from this list, obtaining 3,755 human and 351 swine genomes. Because there are few indels in these flu genomes, a simple first-pass alignment algorithm, written in Perl with the BioPerl toolkit [48] , was used. Essentially, we visually picked out a 6-10-nucleotide candidate region close to the beginning of each of the eight strands of the flu genome that appeared mostly conserved. The algorithm scanned each set of sequences for this segment and added an appropriate number of spaces to the beginning of each for a rough alignment. Using BioEdit [49] , we simply looked for sequences that were misaligned and inserted gaps where necessary to complete the alignment, paying close attention to codon usage. In difficult and ambiguous regions, we chose to minimize the number of changes necessary to produce each variant, similar to the methodology of Carter [44] .

Once an alignment for each of the eight sections of the flu genome was completed, we used another Perl program to scan through the alignment and compare each sequence to a reference strain. Point mutations were counted individually while indels, irrespective of size, were counted as a single change [44] . There are several different ways to calculate sequence differences (discussed in [50] ), but this simple measure is sufficient for the purposes of this paper. Due to variations in technique among the various studies that produced these sequences, the ends of the alignment tended to be ragged. For this reason, we compared only the section of complete alignment between each sequence and the reference genome. The few internal reassortments [32] that have occurred in H1N1 were easily seen in the alignments, but these also made up a small fraction of all sites. We did our best to create a consistent alignment through these regions.

We began by analyzing mutation accumulation during the human H1N1 outbreak of 2009-2010, using strain California/04/2009 as a reference. This was the first sequenced genome of the outbreak included in Kedwaii, et al. [8] . We then calculated the extent of mutational divergence of all subsequent genomes over the duration of the outbreak.

We did a similar, but much larger analysis of mutation accumulation in all human H1N1 strains from 1918 to 2012, using the 1918 "Brevig Mission" reference genome (A/Brevig Mission/1/1918) as a reference. This sequence was missing the last 480 nucleotides of segment 4. We amended this by appending the ending sequence of another 1918 H1N1 virus, A/South Carolina/1/18(H1N1). These two strains had only one nucleotide difference in the ORF of segment 4 (C/T at position 238). Thus, they are essentially identical and we do not expect to have introduced extra mutations in this way.

Using the amended 1918 Brevig Mission virus as a reference and including all human and porcine viruses in the database, we calculated SNPs, indels, transitions, transversions, non-synonymous amino acid changes, dN/dS ratios, predicted protein lengths (for all 11 proteins), the normalized codon scores (NCS) and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) [51] score for each predicted protein of each genome. To calculate the normalized codon score, we downloaded the frequency of each of the 64 codons in the human, duck and domestic pig genomes from the Codon Usage Database [52] . We then created a predicted amino acid chain from each of the respective open reading frames. We calculated NCS for each protein by simply summing the frequency of each codon, as it is used in each of the three species, and then dividing by the total number of codons in the proteins produced. RSCU is simply the number of times any particular codon appears, divided by the number of times synonymous codons appear in that genome. Anhlan, et al. [51] were the first to apply RCSU to influenza genomic data, but they only studied one of the eleven protein products of the H1N1 genome and did not analyze changes over time. Here, we extend their techniques to create a time series in which one can better study shifts in codon usage due to mutation accumulation.

During the 2009-2010 H1N1 outbreak, mutations within H1N1 accumulated at a relatively constant rate ( Figure 1 ). The strains sequenced at the end of the pandemic had approximately 80 more mutations than the 2009 reference genotype. The line of best fit reveals a slope of 42.1 mutations accumulated per year (3.2 × 10 -3 mutations per site per year). Given that the data were collected from viral strains circulating worldwide, the correlation between mutation count and the date of collection was surprisingly good (r 2 = 0.77).

The linear accumulation of mutations during the 2009 outbreak clearly also extends to the longer-term accumulation of mutations during the entire history of H1N1 ( Figure 2 ). During the last century there has been a remarkably constant increase in mutation count within the H1N1 virus population, except for a striking discontinuity between 1957 and 1976. This discontinuity reflects the extinction of the human H1N1 strain in the mid 1950s, followed by the re-introduction of the strain in 1976, presumably from a researcher's freezer. Even though most reports (e.g., [53] ) indicate the re-introduction year was 1977, our data suggests the year of re-introduction was 1976. This is based upon the isolate A/New Jersey/1976, which very clearly falls in line with the rest of the re-introduced lineage. Notice that after re-introduction in 1976, the human H1N1 mutation count and the rate of accumulation resumed exactly where it left off just before the extinction occurred in the 1950s.

Our data clearly show that some non-frozen H1N1 genotypes occasionally appeared in the human population after H1N1 dropped from public concern after 1957 ( Figure 2 ). These fall on the same mutation-count trajectory as the H1N1 circulating before the 1957 extinction. However, these nine strains appear to represent repeated transmission events from pigs to humans that failed to cause any pandemic (the porcine lineage had no extinction event, and hence no pause in mutation accumulation). Nearest neighbor calculations (data not shown) indicate these strains are not a continuation of the human lineage. They cluster tightly with the 2009-2010 outbreak porcine viruses, all of which are more closely related to the 1918 isolate than they are to the human lineage viruses. Thus, we included the 2009-2010 viruses and the nine isolated, nonoutbreak viruses in the "porcine" category. In this same figure, we can see that genotypes from the 2009 outbreak and after ( Figure 2 , circle) fall directly on the trajectory of the non-frozen lineage. This clearly shows that the 2009 genotype was not derived from the 1976 re-introduction virus. Kedwaii, et al. [8] affirmed earlier conclusions that the 2009 genotype was due to a reassortment between two swine viruses, an H1N2 and an H1N1, from different continents, but this did not affect the mutation accumulation curve. Regardless, general attenuation due to genome-wide mutation accumulation might best explain the very low mortality [54] [55] [56] associated with the 2009 pandemic. The earliest 2009 outbreak strain had already accumulated 1,889 mutations compared to the 1918 strain.

The most obvious place to test how reassortment might affect the mutation accumulation curve is with the 2009-2010 "swine flu" outbreak samples. Despite the fact that the viral line has been attributed to reassortment with swine viruses, with partial contribution from earlier reassortments between swine and avian strains [8] , it does not display a jump in mutation count. Reassortment can produce novel antigenic variants, but it does not reverse the majority of mutations, for they have accumulated in the non-reassorted areas of the genome.

After we identified the direct 1918 human lineage viruses, we were able to adjust the dates of the later samples to account for a period of dormancy ( Figure 3 ). When we shifted the "frozen" samples back 21 years (i.e., sequences from 1976 were assigned a recalibrated date of 1955), we see the data lines up almost perfectly (r 2 = 0.989; mutation rate = 14.4). The exact amount of time-frame adjustment was not critical; adjustments ranging from 20 to 30 years all gave excellent alignments, with correlation coefficients above 98%. The observed accumulation rate of roughly 14 mutations per year (1.1 × 10 -3 mutations per site per year) is more or less consistent with previous estimates (e.g., [39, 57] ). The accumulation of non-synonymous mutations in human H1N1 genomes is also shown in Figure 3 . The non-synonymous mutations are not as abundant, as expected, but they are still accumulating at a rapid and constant rate. There were an average of 2.4 amino acid changes per year (0.6 × 10 -3 mutations per codon per year).

Our data show that the lineage re-introduced in 1976 was the only significant human H1N1 strain from 1976 until 2009. The mutation count trajectory of the H1N1 lineage The data in Figure 3 can be used to estimate the time of arrival into the human population of the first H1N1 virus. Extrapolating total mutation count linearly backwards to zero yields a year of first introduction into the human population of approximately 1893. Interestingly, this would be in time to explain the 1889-1890 "Russian" flu outbreak, which has been considered by some to possibly be the first H1N1 outbreak (no sequence or serotype data are available for that event). While our data strongly suggest that the ancestral genotype for all human and porcine H1N1 influenza strains (and by extension, all human influenza strains), entered the human population as early as the 1890s, others have estimated the arrival date to be one or more decades later [5] . Our data strongly confirm that all human H1N1 viruses derive from a single, very recent common ancestor, just as others have concluded prior to this study [1] . Given an estimated arrival date of 1893, we infer that, by 1918, H1N1 would have accumulated roughly 375 (25 years × 15 mutations/year) mutations since the initial genotype invaded the human population. This depends, of course, on the exact arrival date.

Within the entire human H1N1 lineage, only 56% of all nucleotide sites were invariant, indicating intense mutation pressure. Before its apparent extinction in 2009, the human H1N1 lineage had accumulated approximately 1400 mutations (mostly point mutations), including 320 non-synonymous mutations, compared to the 1918 genotype. Across all 3,755 H1N1 genomes isolated from humans (i.e., including the outbreak and non-outbreak porcine versions), we found that only 41.8% of all nucleotide sites were invariant. Multiple variant forms (i.e., 3-fold and 4-fold degeneracy, meaning 3 and sometimes 4 different nucleotides observed at a given site) occurred at 21% of the variable loci, further suggesting that the mutations were primarily non-adaptive. When we included the porcine H1N1 genotypes, only 36.1% of sites remained invariant, with a similar distribution of nucleotide degeneracy. Because the re-introduced H1N1 lineage had accumulated fewer mutations than the porcine H1N1 strains, the disappearance of the human lineage and the subsequent dominance of the 2009 porcine strain in the human population resulted in even more divergence from the 1918 stain: over 1900 nucleotide differences (approximately 15% divergence) and 325 amino acids differences (approximately 7% divergence in protein sequence).

The approximately 90-nucleotide PB1-F2 protein is coded on the second genomic segment and overlaps completely the PB1 coding region [58, 59] Table 1 . PB1-F2 has been implicated in increasing host death rate. Yet, not all influenza viruses code for this protein, so it is not intrinsically necessary for the cycle of infection. In the case of H1N1, the majority (98.2%) of genomes in this study are predicted to fail to produce a full-length version of the protein, including most of the human versions after 1948 and none of the porcine versions prior to 1987. For this reason, only 10 of the 11 influenza proteins were included in RSCU and NCS calculations. All genomes were predicted to produce fully-formed PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M1, M2, and NS1 proteins. Only 14 genomes were expected to fail to produce a functioning NS2 protein due to mutation in the start codon, but all of these had another potential in-frame ATG only a few codons upstream and/or downstream. For this reason, we assumed these viruses would also produce an NS2 protein of proper length.

Mutation accumulation in swine H1N1 since 1918 is shown in Figure 4 , with the human regression line (with "frozen" linage adjusted for 21 years of dormancy) for comparison. Regression analysis (ANCOVA) indicated a significant difference in the slope (p = 0.0001) of the lines of best fit for the viruses obtained from the two species. Although it is clear that the swine versions have more variability towards the end of the sampling period, they also have a higher mutation rate in general, even after adjusting the human data for the 21 year period of dormancy.

We note that many mutations appeared and disappeared several times over the life of H1N1. The data are too sparse over most of the range to know if this is due to repeat mutations at common loci or incomplete genetic sampling of the circulating H1N1 viruses. However, over the 2009-2010 H1N1 outbreak, Kedwaii, et al. [8] demonstrated near-complete lineage loss among the circulating viruses during a single season. Bedford, et al. [33] had similar results in their study of influenza A (H3N2). It was noted earlier that the phylogeny appears as a main trunk with many short-lived side branches. If most mutations are lost from the population quickly, variations that appear several times over the course of H1N1 are most likely due to mutations occurring multiple times in the same place. We do not have enough sequence data to get a full picture of strain diversity in most years, but this will be interesting to pursue as more data become available.

Even though each genomic segment has a slightly different mutation/substitution rate, strong, genome-wide patterns are evident, including a declining ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous codon changes (dN/dS), a declining ratio of transition to transversion mutations (Ti/Tv), and even changes in codon bias. Additional file 1 includes these data on a segment-by-segment basis. Figure 5 illustrates a continuous decline in the Ti/Tv ratio during the entire history of the human H1N1 lineage. This suggests there may be increasing selection against transversions over time, perhaps reflecting some degree of truncation selection as the genome becomes more attenuated and as extinction approaches. A transversion is 2.7 times more likely to cause a non-synonymous change than a transition, and is also more likely to change RNA 3-dimensional configuration. Since we do not see a change in the rate of accumulation of amino acid substitutions over time (Figure 3 ), we suspect that the heightened selection against transversions may be more strongly associated with RNA architectural constraints.

Over the history of the human H1N1 lineage, the accumulation of non-synonymous mutations was highly linear, after correcting the "frozen" samples for 21 years of dormancy ( Figure 3 ). While it is true that this simple distance metric applied to amino acid changes would be expected to underestimate evolutionary relationships at large distances due to an increasing likelihood of multiple changes at individual loci, applying the standard Poisson or Gamma corrections [60] made no improvement to the fit of the regression to two significant figures. We therefore conclude that the relationship is indeed linear, at least over the sampled timescale.

Analysis of the normalized codon scores (NCS) clearly shows that codon preference degenerated continuously throughout the entire history of the human H1N1 line ( Figure 6 ). All viruses in our database are more duck-like in their codon usage and most (99.8%) are more human-like than pig-like, but codon preference moved toward randomized codon use and away from the codon preference of the human, swine and duck hosts. Thus, the virus is not adapting to use the codon preference of any of the 

It has generally been assumed that any non-neutral mutations within the influenza genome have arisen as selective adaptations and generally help drive influenza toward a stronger and more dangerous pathogen (in terms of either pathenogenicity or transmissibility) [41] . This was probably the basis for the extreme caution exhibited during the 2009-2010 H1N1 outbreak. There is a general perception that, given enough time, Figure 7 Relative synonymous codon usage in the direct 1918 human H1N1 lineage for the four alanine codons, after adjusting the "frozen" portion of the lineage (1976-2009) by 21 years. Note that the two decreasing in frequency over time are exactly matched by the two increasing over time (i.e., non-synonymous changes are having a negligible effect). Also, three of these lines (GCA, GCC, and GCG) indicate these codons are drifting even farther away from the human average. H1N1 might mutate into a stronger pathogen, and hence might create another catastrophic pandemic, as it did in 1918.

Selection is evident in H1N1 and other influenza genomes. In certain sites of the HA1 genomic segment of H3, non-synonymous substitutions occur at more than twice the rate as in other sites [39] . This is seen as a major signature of adaptive change, but deleterious mutations in the areas not under selection are carried along with the ones under positive selection [36] . In this light, some perceive H1N1 to be a growing threat, with a new outbreak being just a matter of time. Despite this common perception, a more lethal version of H1N1 has not arisen via mutation within the human population during the last 90+ years. This is significant. The two major human influenza pandemics since 1918 did not arise due to mutations within H1N1, but arose via horizontal transmission of new genetic material from bird influenza strains, creating recombinant viruses. They were also less lethal than the 1918 version. It is true that the population had a degree of residual immunity and was not as immunologically naïve as it was in 1917-18, but selection has still not been able to generate a devastating pandemic from the remnants of that which swept the world at the close of WWI.

In this paper, we examine an alternative point of view regarding mutation accumulation within H1N1. We suggest that, while specific adaptive mutations commonly occur within the H1N1 virus, many more deleterious mutations are accumulating than beneficial mutations, even when there is strong selection. Consequently, H1N1 appears to have been in very gradual error catastrophe throughout its history.

Our results strongly confirm the widely recognized fact that all past and present human and swine H1N1 influenza strains derive from the 1918 strain. By extension, this applies to other human influenza strains, including H3N2 and H2N2 [1] .

Human influenza has such a high mutation rate that, even within a single host individual, the virus quickly becomes a genetically diverse "swarm" [61, 62] . Yet, globally human H1N1 influenza is monophyletic and all current variation is of recent origin. This is only possible if almost all human influenza lineages rapidly go extinct. Moreover, we present strong evidence that the H1N1 genome has been systematically degenerating since 1918. This is evidenced by continuous, systematic, and rapid changes in the H1N1 genome throughout its history. For example, there was an especially rapid and monotonic accumulation of mutations during a single pandemic (Figure 1 ). Similarly, there was a continuous and rapid accumulation of mutations over the entire history of the virus (Figures 2 and 3) , including a similar steady increase in nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions (Figure 3 ). While mutations accumulated in the human H1N1s, there was a parallel accumulation of mutations in the porcine H1N1 lineage (Figure 4) . Fitch, et al. [36] also showed a linear mutation accumulation curve. The "gnarled trunk" of Ito, et al. [42] should be buried in our data as well, but it will be swamped by the pervasive, genome-wide accumulation of mutations not under active selection.

Within the human lineage, there was a systematic decline in the Ti/Tv ratio ( Figure 5 ). In addition, there was a very consistent loss of codon specificity over time (Figures 6  and 7) . We show compelling new evidence supporting the extinction of human H1N1 in the 1950s, its subsequent re-introduction in 1976, and an apparent second extinction event of the human H1N1 lineage in 2009. Strain extinction has often occurred when new strains appeared, including H1N1 replacing the circulating H3-like strains in 1917, H2N2 replacing H1N1 in 1957, and H3N2 replacing H2N2 in 1968 [5] . To our knowledge, we are the first to document the replacement of the re-introduced human H1N1 with reassorted swine H1N1 in 2009. All this is consistent with the genetic attenuation hypothesis, and we feel this is the most fundamental explanation for the very smooth, systematic, and exponential decline in H1N1 mortality rates since 1918 [2] .

In light of these findings, what are the medical implications? Does mutation accumulation really have anything to do with virulence? Simonsen, et al. [2] showed mortality statistics for three influenza strains over multiple years (H1N1 from 1918 to 1987; H2N2 from 1958 to 1962; and H3N2 from 1968 to 1995). Even though there is some debate concerning the mortality burden imposed by influenza viruses [63] , there has clearly been a continuous exponential decline in influenza-related mortality over time, and this is true for all three major serotypes. Since there is a strong linear correlation between mutation count and time (Figures 2 and 3) , and since there is also a close correlation between declining virus-related death rates and time, there is obviously also a correlation between mutation count and reduced death rates. Reduction in mortality may be due to many other factors, including herd immunity, advances in medicine, and advances in hygiene, but would these other factors be expected to follow so tightly the time courses seen in Simonsen? There have been major medical advances since 1918, and these have clearly been a factor in reducing H1N1-related mortalities. Therefore, the correlation between mutation count and reduced H1N1 mortality might be considered spurious by some. However, while it is certainly true that medical intervention has greatly improved in the developed world since 1918, such medical intervention has been much more limited in the rest of the world. Second, the observed decline in mortality is a remarkably smooth curve, while medical advances have occurred in bursts (e.g., the breakthrough in antibiotics, and the more recent development of antivirals). Third, each of the great influenza pandemics (1918, 1956, 1968) involved the emergence of a new viral strain, which then followed its own exponential decline in mortality but within its own timeframe. This uncouples reduction in mortality and stage of medical advance. Finally, the correlation between the exponential decline of H1N1-related mortalities and the linear increase in H1N1 mutations is only one of our evidences for the genetic attenuation of H1N1. Our other evidences include: a) the extinction of all human influenza strains existing prior to the H1N1 strain; b) the apparent extinction of the human lineage of H1N1 in 1956, and then again apparently in 2009; and c) the erosion of H1N1 codon specificity, approaching random codon usage.

It is our contention that all human influenza strains undergo natural attenuation due to mutation accumulation. It is too early to tell if the remaining versions of the 2009-2010 outbreak viruses will do the same, but it is likely given the known history of change in the various influenza genomes.

The decline in codon bias is especially significant for several reasons. First, since the frequency of codon usage is positively correlated with tRNA availability in the cell [64] , the increased use of rare codons is expected to negatively affect protein translation rates. Alternatively, Li, et al. [65] did not notice any decrease in translational efficiency based on codon choice in bacteria, but they did see effects caused by mutation towards other genomic control motifs (i.e., anti-Shine Dalgarno sequences). Part of codon bias deals with a cell's avoidance of controlling factors that do not directly deal with translation rates (e.g., CG dinucleotides). Thus, there are multiple ways a disruption of codon bias might negatively impact the functionality of a particular stretch of any nucleic acid. Second, even though the codon usage in ducks and humans is similar [51] , although less so for swine [52] , this might affect the ability of a virus to cross species lines (after cellular antigenic recognition is taken into account). Third, Anhlan, et al. [51] entertained several hypotheses, including that the virus was avian in origin but transferred to pigs before it jumped to humans. Our data clearly indicate that all H1N1s studied are more duck-like in their codon usage, although we cannot comment about a prehuman swine intermediate based on our data. Finally, since we see an obvious decay in codon bias over time when compared to codon usage in either human, duck, or pig, it is clear that H1N1 is not evolving toward optimal codon usage in any of these species but is slowing drifting away from optimal translational efficiency. We concur with Anhlan, et al. that, "the issue of codon usage seems to be much more important at least for influenza viruses than previously thought."

During the last 100 years, the H1N1 influenza genome has diverged from the original genotype by roughly 15%. Might the approximately 1,900 nucleotide substitutions be primarily attributed to the genetic drift of perfectly neutral variations? This seems unlikely for several reasons. First, a viral genome of approximately 13,000 nucleotides does not have room for very much neutral RNA. Not only did 15% of the genome change, but polymorphisms arose across more than 50% of the genome. This strongly points to extreme mutational pressure, high enough, reasonably, to threaten error catastrophe. Second, if some significant portions of the viral genome are neutral, deletions of such portions of the viral genome should be regularly seen, and selection should favor such deletions, rapidly producing smaller genomes. There is no evidence of significantly smaller influenza genomes. Indeed, there is little evidence of deletion in any of the 2009-2010 genomes compared to the 1918 version. The only major indels occurred among the oldest samples (prior to 1948) in the sixth genomic segment (neuraminidase, or NA), but all of these represented deletions compared to the 1918 genome and all later genomes. Third, it is now known that even synonymous mutations are not always neutral. Even though they may not directly affect protein sequence, they can affect RNA stability, RNA architecture, speed of translation, and protein folding. Fourth, there should only be a finite number of nucleotide positions that are perfectly neutral. Because of this, neutral divergence should quickly approach a limit, causing the rate of divergence from the original genotype to slow, but this is not seen. Finally, the extensive genetic changes observed simply do not appear to be phenotypically neutral; they are tightly correlated with rapid fitness decline, attenuation, extinction of most circulating strains, and even more frequent sub-lineage extinction events.

Might the observed divergence be primarily due to adaptive mutations? We feel that the 15% divergence must be primarily non-adaptive because adaptation should occur rapidly and then reach a natural optimum. Yet, we see that divergence increases in a remarkably linear manner. Furthermore, the virus does not seem to be converging on a new optimal genotype since polymorphism remains extreme (over 50%), since many polymorphic sites have more than two alleles, and since codon specificity is declining over time. Codon patterns can inform us about the origin of the virus, and they tell us that H1N1 is not only drifting away from that original codon use, but it is also drifting away from the host codon preferences. When grown in mouse cell culture, 2009 H1N1 viruses exhibited variation in replication rates, virulence, and pathogenicity, but these did not match the severity of clinical symptoms in humans [66] . Thus, at this time, the exact relationship between mutation load and the severity of infection remains unknown. Yet, selective adaptation is limited to only those amino acids that produce significant phenotypic effects [42] , and, since a viral genome in the absence of reassortment is essentially a single linkage block, it is expected that many more than just adaptive mutations occur. Some of the changes might be due to selection, but the majority certainly are not.

Is it feasible that natural selection might fail to remove a large number of deleterious mutations? It is well known that numerous factors can cause a breakdown in the selective removal of deleterious mutations. These factors include a high mutation rate, a high rate of random loss, limited sexual recombination, genetic bottlenecking, and mutations with very small fitness effects. All of these factors should be especially pronounced in an RNA virus such as influenza and all of these are either previously known or documented here. The genetic changes in H1N1 appear non-directional and are distributed quite uniformly across the genome (Additional file 3), consistent with an accumulation of low-impact deleterious mutations. Error catastrophe and lethal mutagenesis are already recognized as a threat to any RNA virus. These facts, combined with the dramatic decline in H1N1 mortality and the very high rate of H1N1 strain extinction, all very strongly indicate that most of the genetic divergence from the original H1N1 genotype has been due to fixation of slightly deleterious mutations.

Could H1N1 ever back-mutate into a strain such as the ancestral genotype that caused the catastrophic 1917-1918 pandemic? Given that the modern strains of H1N1 have diverged from the original 1918 strain by nearly 2000 mutations, that many of these mutations should be slightly deleterious [67] , and that natural selection was unable to stop their continuous accumulation in the first place, it is difficult to imagine how mutation/selection might ever restore full virulence. Reassortment might bring in new material, but thus far this has only applied to a limited section of the genome, and reassortment today occurs in a very different mutational/genomic context than that of 95 years ago. It is often thought that a high mutation rate translates to rapid adaptation and evolution, yet the reverse seems more commonly true. Deleterious mutations often interfere with selection for the more rare beneficial mutations [67, 68] . Thus, the rapid accumulation of mutations in all H1N1 lineages should logically lead to their eventual extinction.

The origin of human H1N1 influenza is unknown, but it is generally reasoned that it invaded the human population from a natural reservoir [5, 51] , most likely an aquatic waterfowl, with pigs as a possible intermediate host. In light of the strong tendency toward natural genetic attenuation which we document here, we suggest that the natural reservoir most likely involves a very quiescent viral state, as might occur within a host where there is very little viral replication, and hence much lower mutation rates. It would be very interesting to know the rate of influenza mutation accumulation in waterfowl.

Can reassortment explain these findings? Based on our mutation count analysis, there is no evidence for reasortment in the human H1N1 lineage, and it has gone extinct, apparently twice. From other studies, various influenza strains are obviously derived from reassortment, but all this does is set the mutation clock back a little. Any reassortment between a "fresh" virus and a high-mutation-count virus will inevitably lead to, at best, an averaging of the mutational load of the two. The 2009-2010 "swine flu" virus shows evidence of multiple reassortment events in a limited portion of its genome, and it was more robust than the lingering human H1N1 strain that it replaced, but it carries a great number of non-adaptive and presumably deleterious mutations. Reassortment between two viruses of different immunological character might preserve the less degraded genome, but only temporarily.

Might pandemics be shortened by artificially accelerating the rate of genetic attenuation? The continuous and linear accumulation of mutations within a single influenza lineage, as was seen in H1N1 during the 2009-2010 influenza season (in which about 0.3% of all nucleotides mutated), supports the concept that natural genetic attenuation may be an important factor in the natural cessation of influenza pandemics. Thus, the possibility of an artificial acceleration of mutation rate deserves further investigation, and may suggest new avenues of research in terms of pandemic management [13] . It is clear that natural selection is strongly at work in the influenza genome. This can be seen by preservation of all the basic proteins and functions of the virus, in spite of the fact that every possible point mutation happens in every human individual during the course of an infection. A large fraction of all deleterious mutations clearly must be selected away. Likewise, the emergence of major antigenic variants shows that positive selection is operational. It is also clear that genetic drift is strongly in operation, with a major viral bottleneck happening at each transmission from one human host to the next, and perhaps at the start of each local outbreak [33] , ensuring that most unique genotypes are very quickly lost. Yet, in addition to selection and drift, it also appears there is very strong mutational pressure on the influenza genome, potentially leading to lethal mutagenesis in most strains, and a gradual, natural genetic attenuation of human influenza in general.

Read and Taubenberger [69] called the origin of human H1N1 an "enigma" whose riddle was not yet solved. Like them, we see this as an unsolved riddle and we can only hope that our data might bring us one step closer to understanding the origins of this important disease.

Sequence analysis of historical and modern genomes of influenza H1N1 reveal a great deal about the history of the virus. The most recent common ancestor existed only about 120 years ago, and there has been universal extinction of all earlier human influenza strains. The rate of mutational divergence from that original genotype has been very constant both in human and porcine H1N1 strains (roughly 14-16 mutations fixed per year). Modern H1N1 strains have diverged from the original genotype by roughly 1,900 fixations (more than 15% of the genome has mutated). Roughly 7% of the amino acids have mutated. Mutation accumulation is also associated with the historical exponential decline in H1N1 human mortalities, which may suggest significant genetic attenuation, as might arise due to very slow error catastrophe.

Sequence analysis confirms that the human H1N1 strain went extinct in 1957, but was reintroduced in 1976, apparently from a specimen frozen in the early 1950s. The resulting "frozen" lineage appeared less mutated compared to all other contemporary H1N1 strains (i.e., porcine strains and a few rare H1N1 strains appearing in humans but not derived from the frozen strain). Consistent with the genetic attenuation model, the frozen human H1N1 lineage disappeared in 2009, and may now be extinct.

It appears that the H1N1 strains currently in circulation are significantly attenuated, and cannot reasonably be expected to back-mutate into a non-attenuated strain. The greatest influenza threat, therefore, is the introduction of a non-attenuated strain from some natural reservoir. This suggests that a better understanding of the origin of such non-attenuated strains should be a priority [5] . Our findings suggest that new strategies that accelerate natural genetic attenuation of RNA viruses may prove useful for managing future pandemics and, perhaps in the long run, precluding the genesis of new influenza strains.

Obesity and risk of respiratory tract infections: results of an infection-diary based cohort study

Background: Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are a major morbidity factor contributing largely to health care costs and individual quality of life. The aim of the study was to test whether obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 ) is one of the risk factors underlying frequent RTIs in the German adult population. Methods: We recruited 1455 individuals between 18 to 70 years from a cross-sectional survey on airway infections in Germany and invited them to self-report in diaries incident RTIs experienced during three consecutive winter/ spring seasons. RTIs reported in these 18 months and summary measures adding-up individual RTIs were the outcomes of interest.

Results: Compared to individuals with normal weight, obese individuals reported a consistently higher frequency of upper and lower RTIs and predominantly fell in the upper 10% group of a diary sumscore adding-up 10 different RTI symptoms over time. Obesity was associated both with lower RTIs ( adjusted OR = 2.02, 95%CI = 1.36-3.00) and upper RTIs ( adjusted OR = 1.55, 95%CI = 1.22-1.96). Adjusting for demographic and lifestyle variables did only marginally affect ORs. Stratified analyses suggested a stronger association for women and effect modifications by sports activity and dietary habits.

We confirm the association of obesity with infection burden and present evidence for putative interaction with sports activity and dietary patterns.

Frequent and severe respiratory tract infections (RTIs) constitute an important morbidity factor in our society and a considerable cost burden in terms of medical treatment and time of work-loss [1, 2] . RTIs are divided into upper RTIs (URTIs) including common cold, pharyngitis, otitis, sinusitis, laryngotracheitis, epiglottitis and lower RTIs (LRTIs) including bronchitis, pneumonia and bronchiolitis [3] . Individual exposure to infectious agents and host factors such as smoking [4, 5] and vitamin D status [6, 7] are believed to contribute to observed differences in RTI risk. In addition, the role of overweight (body mass index (BMI) = 25.0-29.9 kg/m 2 ) and in particular obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 ) in predisposition to RTIs is increasingly discussed [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . This growing interest is driven by the rising number of overweight and obese individuals worldwide [14] and the emerging knowledge of notable immunological imbalances in association with obesity [15] . Most of the studies targeting adults explored the association of obesity with specific RTIs and their outcomes. Thus, obesity was associated with non-allergic rhinitis [8] and influenza like-illness [9] . Moreover, two population-based studies which investigated the role of obesity as risk factor for community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the general population resulted in controversial findings [10, 11] . Two recent Danish population-based studies reported an excess of a large spectrum of RTIs including pneumonia among obese people [12, 13] . The overall aim of our study targeting the adult population in South Baden, Germany, is to identify risk factors for the susceptibility to RTIs. Here we present data on the role of obesity as contributing factor to a high RTI burden in the German society and explore effect modification by gender, sports activity and nutritional patterns.

Study participants (n = 1455) were recruited from the airway infection susceptibility (AWIS) cross sectional study querying RTI burden in an adult population in South-Baden, Germany [16] . The study protocol was approved by community officials and the Ethics Committee of the University of Freiburg (Ref. No. 258/11_120365). Based on the RTI history-score individuals of putative low, medium and high risk of future RTIs were invited to the actual sub-cohort. The RTI history score is summarizing information on the frequency and severity of RTIs and antibiotics use over the past two years, selfassessed RTI susceptibility, and occurrence of selected severe infections [16] . Study participants were requested to fill-in an additional questionnaire (baseline questionnaire) on lifestyle factors and co-morbidities and to complete monthly diaries registering the monthly occurrence and the duration (< 2 weeks, > 2 weeks) of RTIs, namely sinusitis, rhinitis, otitis media, pharyngitis/laryngitis, tonsillitis, influenza-like illness, bronchitis, pneumonia, pleurisy and other acute RTIs, from the beginning of November to the end of April of three seasons: 2012/13, 2013/14 and 2014/15. Furthermore, the intake of antibiotics, doctor visits, hospitalisation for RTIs and the impact of RTI symptoms on their daily activities were queried. Further recruitment details into the AWIS study and the present sub-cohort are presented under Additional files 1 and 2. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.

In order to describe the association between obesity and RTIs, different outcome indicators were considered: outcomes at the level of each month ["any RTI", "any URTI" (sinusitis, rhinitis, otitis media, pharyngitis/laryngitis and tonsillitis), "any LRTI" (bronchitis, pneumonia and pleurisy), "≥3 RTIs", "any long lasting infection" (> 2 weeks)]; at the level of each winter season ("≥4 months with infections", "≥3 long lasting infections"); and at the individual level (i.e. are defined once per individual and covering the overall study period). The ten specific RTI symptom categories were considered with the binary symptom indicators "infection reported" or "no infection reported" for each month.

When counting the episodes for the outcome indicator "≥3 long lasting infections", different infection symptoms were counted as separate episodes, even if they overlapped in time. However, within one symptom category at least one month without this specific infection was required to call it a new episode. We also calculated a monthly diary RTI score, averaging the ten RTI symptom categories with the coding "0" for "no infection reported", "1" for "reported infection with duration < 2 weeks", and "2" for "reported infection present with duration >2 weeks". Missing values for individual infection items were treated as zero. If an individual RTI symptom was reported, but information on duration was missing, it was counted as "reported infection with duration < 2 weeks". If all items were missing, no diary score was computed. The diary RTI score at the monthly level was expanded to a score at the seasonal level by averaging over the six months (November-April) of each season, and to an overall score at the individual level by averaging over all available months. The respective upper 10% of these diary scores within each month, season and overall served as additional outcome indicators.

Further variables considered in the study were age, gender, self-reported weight and height for BMI calculation (BMI was categorized as < 30 (non-obese), 25 ≤ BMI < 30 (overweight) and ≥30 (obese)), educational level, contact with children, comorbidities, removed immunological organs, smoking status, sports activity and dietary intake patterns. Details on these variables are described in the Additional file 1 and supplementary information on dietary intake patterns is presented in Additional file 3.

Statistical analysis was performed using Stata (version 14 STATSCorp, USA). Descriptive statistics: Monthly prevalences of individual RTI symptoms were computed by taking the average over all subjects available at each month and then averaging over all 18 months covered. Prevalences at the seasonal level were computed accordingly averaging over all three seasons covered. The corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values are based on a generalised linear model with identity link and binomial type variance together with robust variance estimates. The frequency of long lasting infections among all months with infections was analysed accordingly. However, due to the limited number of cases for tonsillitis and otitis media we determined the monthly frequency of long-lasting infections by pooling the data over all seasons and for pneumonia by pooling all indicated months.

At the monthly level ORs were computed using a logistic regression model with a random intercept applied to the individual data for each month taking the 18 months as a categorical covariate into account in addition to the obesity status indicator. Due to its small prevalence, pleurisy was not considered as single outcome in these analyses. Outcomes at the seasonal level were analysed accordingly with the individual data for each winter season and taking into account the three seasons as a categorical covariate. Outcomes at the individual level were analysed using a logistic regression model. Results are ORs and 95% CIs. Adjusted ORs are based on including age groups and education as simultaneous categorical covariates. Furthermore, in order to study the stability of the obesity-RTI association with respect to potential confounders, ORs were adjusted by respective variables. Subjects with incomplete covariate data were excluded from multivariate analyses.

Effect modification by a binary variable was assessed by fitting an overall model with the corresponding interactions parametrized so that we could directly read off the two subgroup-specific ORs. Effect modification by sports activity and nutrition patterns was explored among those representing the lower and upper third of respective scores.

The study population comprised 1455 individuals (931 female and 524 male) with a median age of 51.08 years. Based on BMI calculated from self-reported weight and height, 2.1% of the population was underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m 2 ), 54% had a normal weight (18.5 kg/m 2 ≤ BMI < 25 kg/m 2 ), 31.1% was overweight, and 12.8% was considered obese (Table 1 ). In women, the distribution was 2.8%, 60.21%, 25.0%, and 12.1% and in men 0.76%, 43.1%, 41.8%, and 14.3%, respectively. The study participants were mainly of medium and high educational level, non-or ex-smokers, moderately affected by selected co-morbidities and they reported rather infrequent contact to small children. Further information on the study population and completed diaries is reported in Table 1 and Additional file 4.

Missing rates of single items in the returned diaries were limited and ranged from 1.2% for rhinitis and pharyngitis/laryngitis to 2.6% for other acute respiratory infections. Study participants reported most frequently rhinitis (26.6%), followed by influenza-like illness (11.4%) and pharyngitis/laryngitis (10.5%), whereas pleurisy (0.10%) was rarely experienced. Any URTI (31.5%) was more frequent than any LRTI (7.9%). Apart from the LRTIs bronchitis, pneumonia and pleurisy, which more men than women reported, all other RTIs were more prevalent among women (Table 2 ). Seasonal patterns of reported infections show a February peak for two of the three assessed infection seasons (2012/13 and 2014/15, see Additional file 5). Respiratory infections with a high fraction of long duration were almost exclusively LRTIs, namely pneumonia (59%), followed by bronchitis (48.2%). Men were overrepresented among those with long-lasting RTIs ( Table 2) .

Compared to normal weight individuals, overweight and obese people consistently had a higher prevalence (Table 3) for the single RTIs, URTIs, LRTIs, as well as the other outcome parameters we looked at with other acute infections and pneumonia as the exceptions. For pneumonia, only obese subjects had a higher prevalence. The overweight group was typically falling in between the groups with normal weight and obesity ( Table 3 ). The strongest association was seen for pneumonia and bronchitis, and accordingly, any LRTI was more strongly associated with obesity than any URTI. Long-lasting RTIs, frequent RTIs and high diary scores were also more strongly associated with obesity than the individual symptoms. Adjustments by age and education did only marginally change these estimates. Among subjects with an infection, long lasting infections were again associated with obesity, reaching significance for any RTI, rhinitis, pharyngitis/laryngitis, influenza-like illness, and bronchitis ( Table 3) .

For a better understanding of the robustness of the relationship between RTI burden and obesity, the effect of adjusting for putative confounders was explored (Additional file 6). The studied demographic and lifestyle variables (age, gender, education level, smoking status, contact to children, asthma, sports activity, dietary patterns and previous removal of immune organs) did only marginally affect ORs. However, adjustment for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or a summary score covering all queried co-morbidities weakened the relationship between obesity and all outcomes considerably. Adjustment for vitamin D levels among those for which serum was available (n = 508), had only a slight effect on the magnitude of the association between obesity and RTI outcomes.

The association between obesity and RTI outcomes was more prominent for women than for men and reached statistical significance only for the former (Table 4 ). For most outcomes this interaction was not significant, with the individual level diary score as an exception. When looking at sports activity, for most outcomes the association with obesity was confined to those physically more active and not seen for those reporting little sports activity (Table 5 ). For all outcomes the association was less pronounced in the latter group (compare the ratios of ORs in Table 5 ), a difference that reached significance for all outcomes except those with low prevalence. Typically the prevalence of an outcome was only increased in the small group of people with obesity and higher sports activity whereas all other groups presented rather similar patterns. Similarly, the prevalence of outcomes was increased among people with obesity and a more favourable nutritional pattern, but comparable among the other groups ( Table 6 ). The interaction reaches significance for the majority of outcomes.

RTIs constitute an important morbidity factor considering the high health care costs, the time lost from work, and the impaired quality of life among those recurrently affected [1, 2, 17] . Obesity belongs to one of the host risk factors for RTI and has possibly an emerging role due to the dramatically increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide. In the present study, we report on the association of obesity with individual RTIs as well as with a diary score summarising different incident RTI symptoms over a period of 18 months. Our investigation could demonstrate an association between obesity and RTIs confirming previous findings on influenza-like illness [9] , bronchitis [18] and pneumonia [10, 12] . We also saw an association between obesity and rhinitis, sinusitis and pharyngitis/laryngitis. An elevated risk for sinusitis among obese was also reported in a populationbased cohort of Danish women [13] . None of the two Danish population-based studies [12, 13] used ORs of monthly prevalence, but hazard ratios (HRs), as they could identify events on a daily basis. The HR of 1.6 [12] for the association with RTIs and the HR of 1.48 [13] for the association with URTIs are, however, of similar magnitude to the risk estimates which we observed. Mechanistically, excess adiposity might weigh down host defence as several mouse as well as human studies have suggested [19, 20] . The here observed associations were more prominent for LRTIs compared to URTIs, but evident for both, and more pronounced when considering long lasting or frequent RTIs compared to single symptoms. Based on the infection diary data, we generated a RTI diary score summing-up all ten symptoms and allowing to average per month, per whole season or over the whole period of three years. Considering the upper ten percentile of the distribution of such scores as an outcome, associations were typically stronger than when considering single symptoms, and interactions were more pronounced. Moreover, the results of the seasonal score were very similar or even stronger than those of the three-years score, arguing for the adequacy to query six months infectious events in future studies to identify the infection-prone sub-group of the population. Lifestyle habits seem to contribute to an individual's risk for RTI. Among them, cigarette smoking has been reported as a major environmental risk factor for recurrent and severe RTIs [4, 5] . Frequent contact to small children [21, 22] , vitamin D deficiency [23, 24] , and lack of physical activity [25, 26] constitute other exposures associated with heightened RTI risks. Moreover, higher levels of education were associated with a lower risk of CAP [27] . Based on those previous findings we investigated their role as possible confounders. The association between obesity and RTIs remained nearly unchanged after adjustment for age, gender, educational status, contact to children, smoking status, sports activity and nutrition scores, suggesting that the association is not markedly confounded by the effects of these factors on both BMI and the risk of infections. Also additional adjustment by measured serum vitamin D in a subgroup for which measurements were available did not change the risk estimates considerably. This supports arguments that the observed associations between obesity and RTI burden are due to physiological differences in the immune responsiveness between obese and non-obese individuals rather than lifestyle differences. In addition, some chronic diseases, foremost asthma and COPD, are associated with both an increased risk of RTIs and obesity [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Considering these associations we investigated the effect of asthma, COPD and a comorbidity scoresummarizing the other chronic conditionson the relationship between obesity and individual RTIs and the RTI diary score. Adjusting for these conditions individually and even more so in a combined fashion resulted in a considerable attenuation of the association between obesity and considered RTI outcomes. Hence part of the association between infections and obesity might be explainable by associations of co-morbidities with both. We see a gender difference in the observed associations with more noticeable findings for women. A significantly increased risk for combined RTIs was also restricted to women in a Danish blood donor cohort [12] . Several lines of research support this notion: Szabova et al. and Ilavska et al. reported gender-dependent effects of obesity on the immune system [33, 34] . The effect of BMI on a variety of immune parameters including those with relevance for immune defence was much more apparent in women than in men [34] . NK cells (CD3-/CD16+/CD56+), represent first-line cells for the clearing of virus-infected cells. Reduced levels of these cells reported for obese women, but not for respective men, might underlie the gender effect seen in our study. We also investigated a potential effect modification by sports activity and nutrition. Interestingly, an association between obesity and RTIs was evident only for those obese individuals who reported a higher level of sports activity. Thus, only the group of obese people who engaged in more intensive sports activity reported RTIs more frequently whereas obese people with low sports activity and non-obese with low or high sports activity showed comparable lower prevalences for most outcomes. We hypothesize that oxidative stress induced by vigorous aerobic as well as anaerobic sports activity is exacerbated in people with obesity, but not in normal weight individuals. Evidence supporting this has been previously published [35] . An imbalanced oxidative stress status may have negative consequences on mounting an appropriate immune response towards respiratory pathogens. Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) was shown to hinder T cell responses to viral infection [36] and ROS accumulation was detected in autophagy-deficient effector T cells rendering them incapable of controlling viral infections [37] .

A similar surprising result was found when studying the effect modification by dietary patterns. Here we queried the participants' dietary habits and classified them as adhering to a more favourable or more unfavourable dietary pattern according to Winkler et al. [38] . Aware of the limitations of a one-time assessment of a habitual diet, we found a more pronounced relationship between obesity and infections among obese people who reported an apparent healthier diet. Thus, again only the group of obese individuals who presumably eat a healthier diet showed an increased risk of RTIs. The question arises as to whether misreporting of dietary habits among these individuals with and without RTIs may explain the puzzle. One can imagine that obese individuals may have an increased perception of RTI related symptoms experiencing the contradiction between living a healthy lifestyle and being affected by excess weight and frequent infections. On the other hand the inconspicuous results from the non-obese population with respect to favourable and unfavourable diet pattern would somewhat argue against this explanation. Alternatively, among the group of people with obesity a genetically defined subgroup may exist predisposing to both, excess body weight and proneness to infections.

As strengths of our study we count 1) its sample size, allowing for the analysis of effect modification, 2) its prospective design involving 18 months infection diaries for the exploration of the relationship between BMI and subsequent RTI frequency and severity, 3) the comprehensive information on lifestyle and co-morbidities allowing to study the interplay of such factors on their effect on infections, and 4) the wide range of outcome indicators considered. The uniformity of the results with respect to these outcomes also suggests that in the field of airway infection morbidity, studies may be comparable despite the fact that they often concentrate on different RTI outcomes. In line with the majority of epidemiological studies in this area of research, our study suffers from some limitations, including the reliance on self-reported outcomes and exposure data with the risk of misclassification. However, we found -for instance -a good agreement between BMI derived from self-reported weight and height data and BMI calculated from measured values available for a sub-cohort (n = 508). Moreover, differential misclassification which would substantially bias the relationship between obesity and RTIs is rather unexpected in this setting. The disproportional selection of women into the study may negatively impact the generalizability of some of our results.

Appropriate Models for the Management of Infectious Diseases

Mathematical models have become invaluable management tools for epidemiologists, both shedding light on the mechanisms underlying observed dynamics as well as making quantitative predictions on the effectiveness of different control measures. Here, we explain how substantial biases are introduced by two important, yet largely ignored, assumptions at the core of the vast majority of such models.

First, we use analytical methods to show that (i) ignoring the latent period or (ii) making the common assumption of exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods (when including the latent period) always results in underestimating the basic reproductive ratio of an infection from outbreak data. We then proceed to illustrate these points by fitting epidemic models to data from an influenza outbreak. Finally, we document how such unrealistic a priori assumptions concerning model structure give rise to systematically overoptimistic predictions on the outcome of potential management options.

This work aims to highlight that, when developing models for public health use, we need to pay careful attention to the intrinsic assumptions embedded within classical frameworks.

Mathematical models have become invaluable management tools for epidemiologists, both shedding light on the mechanisms underlying observed dynamics as well as making quantitative predictions on the effectiveness of different control measures. Here, we explain how substantial biases are introduced by two important, yet largely ignored, assumptions at the core of the vast majority of such models.

First, we use analytical methods to show that (i) ignoring the latent period or (ii) making the common assumption of exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods (when including the latent period) always results in underestimating the basic reproductive ratio of an infection from outbreak data. We then proceed to illustrate these points by fitting epidemic models to data from an influenza outbreak. Finally, we document how such unrealistic a priori assumptions concerning model structure give rise to systematically overoptimistic predictions on the outcome of potential management options.

The past decade has seen a dramatic increase in the significance attached to infectious diseases from the public health perspective. This trend is due in part to the emergence of new and highly pathogenic infections such as Ebola [1] , West Nile virus [2] , and SARS [3] . There are also wellpublicized concerns surrounding the deliberate introduction of pathogens as bioterrorism weapons [4, 5] , and the continued persistence and resurgence of older infections, several of which now boast strains resistant to more than one drug [6] . In addition, there have been a number of high-profile and economically expensive disease outbreaks in domestic livestock [7] [8] [9] as well as wildlife populations [10] .

The effective management and control of such infections is increasingly done with substantial input from mathematical models, which are used not only to provide information on the nature of the infection itself, through estimates of key parameters such as the basic reproductive ratio R 0 [11] , but also to make predictions about the likely outcome of alternative courses of action [12] [13] [14] [15] . During the 2001 outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom, for example, the former UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food set up a committee that included two groups with expertise in mathematical modeling of disease dynamics. It is becoming increasingly important, therefore, that epidemiological models produce accurate quantitative predictions, and this in turn relies on accurate parameterization. Here, we examine the dynamical consequences of an unrealistic yet almost ubiquitous assumption embedded in such models concerning the distribution of the latent and infectious periods. In particular, we show that without greater care in model formulation, we may risk systematic biases when parameterizing models from data and may make overly optimistic policy recommendations.

The most commonly used framework for epidemiological systems, is still the susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) class of models, in which the host population is categorized according to infection status as either susceptible, infectious, or recovered [16, 17] . Subsequent refinements of the model have incorporated an additional exposed (infected but not yet infectious) class (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered [SEIR] models) (see Protocol S1 for mathematical equations). One of the fundamental mathematical assumptions in such models is that the rate of leaving the exposed or infectious class is constant, irrespective of the period already spent in that class. While mathematically very convenient, this assumption gives rise to exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods, which is epidemiologically unrealistic for most infections [18] [19] [20] . A more sensible formulation would be to specify the probability of leaving a class as a function of the time spent within the class, such that initially the chance of leaving the class is small, but the probability increases as the mean infectious/latent period is reached. This would give rise to a more realistic distribution of latent and infectious periods, with a stronger central tendency. A convenient way to describe such distributions is to write an expression for the infectious class (neglecting the latent class for this example) as follows: 

which translates mathematically into

where b is the infection transmission rate and N is the total population size. The probability of remaining infectious through time is governed by the survivorship function, P(t), and as such the average infectious period, denoted by 1/c, is given by R ' 0 PðtÞdt [21] . The probability density function of the infectious period, p(t), is just the negative derivative of the survivorship function, ÀdP(t)/dt. Different functional forms for p(t) give rise to alternative assumptions concerning the distribution of the infectious period in the model. For example, setting p(t) equal to e Àct /c recovers the classical exponentially distributed SIR model. More realistic distributions can be obtained by choosing p(t) to be a gamma probability density function [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] , with parameters c and n (see Protocol S1). An alternative (and computationally efficient) means of modeling infections with gamma distributions is to divide the infectious class into n subclasses with nc being the rate of sequential progression through the subclasses. The advantage of this formalism is that when n ¼ 1 we recover the exponentially distributed model, which has a large variance, while as n!' we obtain a fixed infectious period. The effects of n on the distribution of the infectious period are demonstrated in Figure 1A ; in Table 1 we present some examples of latent and infectious period distributions estimated from data.

The dynamical consequences of these differences in the distribution of infectious and latent periods have received some attention over the past two decades. It has been shown, for example, that the precise distribution of the infectious period has no qualitative effects on the asymptotic values or properties of the system [21, 24] , though perturbations to the endemic equilibrium take longer to die out as n increases [22, 26] . When contact rates vary seasonally, for example, to mimic the aggregation of children in schools [28, 29] , changes in p(t) are known to have important consequences for the persistence likelihood of infections [25, 26, 30 ]. An issue that has received surprisingly little attention, despite its obvious applicability to emerging infections and possible ''deliberate exposure,'' is the influence of latent and infectious period distributions on the invasion dynamics of an infection into a largely susceptible population. This is in contrast to the conceptually similar situation of within-host dynamics of viral disease, such as HIV, for which some models already adopt realistic distributions to describe stages in the cell life cycle [31, 32] . In particular, Lloyd [33] has shown how parameter estimates made from viral load data are affected by different assumptions about these distributions. Here we are interested in the application of this work to between-host transmission dynamics. As can be seen in Figure 1B , changes in the gamma distribution parameter n have substantial quantitative consequences for the epidemic curve: in comparison to a gamma-distributed model, the epidemic given by the exponentially distributed model (i) takes off at a dramatically slower rate, (ii) predicts a significantly smaller (approximately 56%) peak number of cases, and (iii) lasts much longer (almost twice as long).

Whether these marked differences between alternate model formulations may translate into potentially important public health concerns is a key question, which we address in two ways. First, we document systematic differences in the model parameters estimated from an epidemic using the exponential and gamma-distributed models. Second, we demonstrate that the use of exponential models produces overoptimistic predictions about the low levels of control required to subdue an epidemic.

The Relationship between R 0 and Initial Epidemic Growth Rate During the early phase of an epidemic, the observed exponential growth rate, k, is related to the basic reproduc-tive ratio, R 0 , of the infection. Mathematically, k is just the dominant eigenvalue of the disease-free equilibrium, and one can show that k must satisfy

for the SEIR model with gamma-distributed latent and infectious periods (further details are given in Protocol S1). This equation translates into an expression for R 0 in terms of k and the other parameters, as is presented in equation 4. Therefore, if we can estimate the growth rate k from data, we can use equation 4 to obtain an estimate of R 0 .

To study the effects of contact tracing and isolation, we modify the assumptions of the SEIR epidemic model, while still incorporating gamma-distributed latent and infectious periods. In the new model, isolation of newly infectious cases occurs at a daily rate of d I after a delay of s D days, which represents a period when infected individuals are infectious but asymptomatic or undetectable (I A ). A fraction q of those who had contact with an infectious and symptomatic individual (I S ) (but did not contract the infection) are removed to the quarantined susceptible class, S Q , where they spend exactly s Q days. An identical fraction of newly exposed individuals is also quarantined. Full details of the model equations are given in Protocol S1.

In a typical management setting, such as the SARS outbreak of 2003, public health professionals are confronted with a novel (or perhaps a highly virulent variant of an existing) pathogen that is spreading rapidly through a predominantly susceptible population. One of the important tasks of any modeling exercise is to provide insights into some of the epidemiological characteristics of the invading infection, such as its transmissibility, virulence, and persistence dynamics. Of great interest is the estimation of the basic reproductive ratio of the infection (R 0 ), which measures the transmission potential of the infection, and determines the degree of control required.

Some of these aspects can be explored by studying the range of model parameters that give (initial) outbreak dynamics consistent with the (short-term) epidemic data thus far gathered. One approach is to fit model parameters to data by ''trajectory matching,'' where one looks for the combination of parameters that, in a statistically rigorous sense, give rise to dynamics most consistent with observed patterns [34, 35] . Alternatively, one may use the well-established result that during the initial stages of an epidemic, the growth rate is approximately exponential [17, 20] , with the rate determined by R 0 . First, we use this approach to examine, in general, how the distribution of the latent and infectious periods may affect the estimation of R 0 from initial epidemic data. To illustrate that our results are not specific to this methodology, we then take incidence data from an influenza outbreak and parameterize the epidemic models using trajectory matching.

Estimating R 0 from Initial Epidemic Growth Rate

We may obtain an estimate for R 0 by calculating the initial growth rate (k) of an infection from data and equating it to the growth rate of the equations, calculated from the dominant eigenvalue of the disease-free equilibrium (see Methods). Such an exercise reveals that for any observed k, the precise value of R 0 estimated is crucially dependent on the fundamental assumptions made concerning the distributions of latent and infectious periods. Specifically, we find that the following equation determines the relationship between R 0 and an empirically estimated epidemic growth rate, k:

where m and n represent the number of subclasses in the exposed and infectious categories, respectively. The mean latent and infectious periods are represented by 1/r and 1/c, respectively, and are assumed to be known or estimated from independent data. This relationship was first determined by Anderson and Watson [36] and has recently been applied in the context of viral life cycle dynamics by Lloyd [33] . The relationship between estimated R 0 and the distributions of the latent and infectious periods is demonstrated in Figure 2A . It reveals a subtle yet very important interaction between model structure and estimated R 0 . In general, as the infectious period becomes more tightly distributed (increasing n), lower values of R 0 are estimated for any given growth rate k. On the other hand, as the variance in the latent period is reduced (increasing m), higher values of R 0 are estimated. Indeed, we may use the relationship given by equation 4 to arrive at the following general principle: if we ignore the latent period, then models with an exponentially distributed infectious period will always overestimate the infection's basic reproductive ratio. When the latent period is included, however, this finding is reversed when the growth rate is large ( Figure 2B ). In closely examining equation 4, we note that the basic reproductive ratio estimated from a model without an exposed class (1/r ¼ 0) is always lower than the estimate from the corresponding model when a latent period is included (1/ r . 0) (see equation S1 in Protocol S1). Therefore, when faced with a rapidly spreading infection, either entirely ignoring the latent period or assuming exponential distributions will lead to an underestimate of R 0 and therefore will underestimate the level of global control measures (such as mass vaccination) that will be needed to control the epidemic. The effects of changing the distributions of the latent and infectious periods on the estimated value of R 0 , with k assumed to be 100 per year and the average latent and infectious periods fixed at 1 wk. The gray grid surfaces show the asymptotic values of R 0 when the latent and infectious periods are both exponentially distributed (lower surface) or fixed (higher surface). We note that the shape of each surface is independent of the exact value of k. (B) At higher values of k, R 0 may be substantially over-or underestimated using the classical exponentially distributed model (n ¼ m ¼ 1) compared to periods of fixed lengths (n ¼ m!'), depending on whether an exposed class is included (solid lines) or not (dashed lines).

Estimating R 0 from Trajectory Matching While the results described in the previous section are based on the rate of epidemic take-off, we reach the same qualitative conclusions about the effects of the distributions of latent and infectious periods when estimating R 0 by other data-fitting methods. For illustration, we use data from an influenza outbreak in an English boarding school [37] to estimate model parameters by trajectory matching. In the absence of independent data, this method can be used to provide estimates of the key infectious parameters. Of course, here we can also compare the parameter estimates to observed parameter ranges, since the influenza virus is known to have a latent period of between 1 and 4 d and infected individuals may transmit the virus up to 4 or 5 d after the onset of illness [38] . We determine the best fit of the model output to daily incidence data by minimizing the least squares errors for different values of the distribution parameters m and n. For comparison, we also determine the best-fit parameters in the absence of any latent period. The least squares errors and estimated R 0 of the best fit for a combination of m and n are presented in Figure 3 . These results clearly illustrate the points raised in the previous section: (i) entirely ignoring the latent period gives a significantly lower estimate of R 0 , and (ii) the assumption of exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods results in consistently lower estimates of R 0 than their gammadistributed counterparts.

Despite visually similar solutions, the SIR best-fit and SEIR best-fit models ( Figure 3C ) result in strikingly different estimates of R 0 : 3.74 for the SIR model versus 35.9 for the SEIR model, which is partly a result of the small population size. However, the best-fit estimate of R 0 obtained from the gamma-distributed SEIR model (m ¼ 2, n ¼ 2) is much more sensitive to the number of points used to obtain the fit ( Figure 3D ): the exponentially distributed SIR model gives the same estimate whether the first six (up to the peak in incidence) or more points are used. This difference is further emphasized if we use the first few points of the data to estimate the rate of epidemic take-off (k ¼ 1.0837 d À1 ), and then take the final estimates of the average latent and infectious periods to compute R 0 using equation 4. For the SIR model (n ¼ 1, 1/c ¼ 2.2 d) we obtain an R 0 of 4.38 whereas for the SEIR model (m ¼ 2, n ¼ 2, 1/r ¼ 2.6 d, 1/c ¼ 2.1 d) we obtain an R 0 of 16.9. Thus the initial rate of increase in incidence does well in estimating R 0 for the exponentially distributed SIR model but significantly less well for the gamma-distributed SEIR model. Given that we are fitting an additional parameter, it is to be expected that a limited number of data points confounds the estimation of R 0 when we include a latent period in the model assumptions. However, this also highlights that even when incorporating a latent period, estimates of R 0 based on the initial epidemic growth rate may potentially underestimate the true value of R 0 .

The results outlined above highlight the pitfalls of making a priori assumptions concerning the distributions of latent and infectious periods when estimating parameters. Depending on the precise details, inappropriate model selection may give rise to either gross over-or underestimates for the basic reproductive ratio of an infection. However, even when parameter estimates are reliable, choice of model structure can also be very important when making recommendations concerning individual-level control strategies. Historically, it has been shown that contact tracing and the effective quarantine of infected individuals and those potentially exposed is an important means of infection management [13, 39, 40] . We introduce both these measures into the SEIR epidemic model, assuming that there is a small delay in detecting newly infectious individuals, which may represent an asymptomatic phase or uncertainty in diagnosing symptoms (see Methods and Protocol S1). As we show in Figure 4 , the precise levels of isolation of infected individuals and of quarantining contacts required to control the outbreak and the predicted level of disease incidence are crucially affected by whether the classic exponentially distributed SEIR model or a more realistic framework is used.

The process of isolating infected individuals results in a reduction in the mean infectious period (see Protocol S1). It is much more effective when the infectious period is exponentially distributed because it essentially truncates the tail of the distribution, so that the infectious period of a few individuals is dramatically reduced. This effect is not as pronounced in the gamma-distributed models because there is less variation in the infectious periods (see Figure 1A ). In the same way, a longer delay in detecting infected individuals has fewer consequences for the exponentially distributed model because during this time many individuals will have naturally left the infectious class. Under the assumption of a gamma-distributed infectious period most individuals are infectious for a minimum period of time so early detection is (C) We plot the incidence data along with the SEIR best fit (m ¼ 2, n ¼ 2) and that obtained by ignoring any latent period (n ¼ 1)-the SIR best fit. (D) The best-fit estimate of R 0 changes for these two models as we increase the number of points used in the fitting procedure. When fitting the models, for each value of n (and m), we are estimating the average infectious period, 1/c, and transmission parameter, b (and average latent period, 1/r). The effective population size for the influenza outbreak was known to be N ¼ 763. DOI: 10.1371/journal.pmed.0020174.g003 more important. While the predicted difference between the exponential and gamma-distributed models depends on the duration of the infectious period and the fraction of contacts traced, it is generally true that models with an exponentially distributed infectious period will give rise to overly optimistic predictions concerning the effectiveness of isolating infected individuals.

To focus on the effects of the infectious period distribution on different courses of intervention we have assumed that all those who are quarantined and exposed are detected before the end of the quarantine period and are not released back into the general population. We have also formulated a model that takes into account the distribution of the latent period during quarantine and find similar qualitative results to those shown in Figure 4 . However, if the average latent period is increased relative to the fixed quarantine period and there is only a small amount of isolation of infected individuals, then the control measures are predicted to be more effective for the gamma-distributed model, because more exposed individuals in the exponentially distributed model will leave quarantine before they develop the infection.

The use of models in epidemiology dates back almost a century, and while traditional models have often been highly successful in explaining observed dynamics [17, 20, 28, 29, 41] , our results show that within a strict management setting, epidemiological details can make a crucial difference. Although a body of theoretical work [25, 26, 30] has demonstrated the importance of incorporating realistic distributions of latent and infectious periods into models of endemic disease, few studies have considered the effects associated with making predictions for an emerging disease [42] .

The large discrepancies between estimates of R 0 from the exponentially distributed and gamma-distributed fits reiterate the importance of accurately determining the precise distributions of latent and infectious periods. Although the data required for such a task are often available from post hoc analyses of epidemics they are certainly lacking for a novel emerging infection. Instead, the uncertainty surrounding assumptions about the distributions should be incorporated into quantitative predictions made from epidemiological models, especially since this may well be greater than any uncertainty that arises from noise in the data. Of course, more sophisticated fitting methods than those used in this paper exist [43] [44] [45] [46] , but if the underlying structure of the model is inappropriate, the method of parameterization is largely irrelevant.

The take home message from our work is that when developing models for public health use, we need to pay careful attention to the intrinsic assumptions embedded within classical frameworks. While some practitioners are already using the approach we advocate [3, 15, 34, 39, 47] , the vast majority of applied epidemiological studies still use models that incorporate exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods. Perhaps this work points to the next steps in delivering quantitatively accurate epidemiological models.

eEF1A Interacts with the NS5A Protein and Inhibits the Growth of Classical Swine Fever Virus

The NS5A protein of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is involved in the RNA synthesis and viral replication. However, the NS5A-interacting cellular proteins engaged in the CSFV replication are poorly defined. Using yeast two-hybrid screen, the eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) was identified to be an NS5A-binding partner. The NS5A-eEF1A interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation, glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown and laser confocal microscopy assays. The domain I of eEF1A was shown to be critical for the NS5A-eEF1A interaction. Overexpression of eEF1A suppressed the CSFV growth markedly, and conversely, knockdown of eEF1A enhanced the CSFV replication significantly. Furthermore, eEF1A, as well as NS5A, was found to reduce the translation efficiency of the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of CSFV in a dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by luciferase reporter assay. Streptavidin pulldown assay revealed that eEF1A could bind to the CSFV IRES. Collectively, our results suggest that eEF1A interacts with NS5A and negatively regulates the growth of CSFV.

Classical swine fever virus (CSFV), together with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and border disease virus (BDV), is a member of the genus Pestivirus within the family Flaviviridae and an important pathogen of pigs that often causes huge economic losses to the pig industry worldwide. CSFV is a small enveloped virus with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of 12.3 kb. The RNA genome contains a single large open reading frame (ORF) coding for a polyprotein, flanked by a 5 1 -untranslated region (UTR) and a 3 1 -UTR. Under cellular and viral protease processing, the polyprotein is processed into 11 mature proteins, including four structural proteins (C, E rns , E1 and E2) and seven nonstructural proteins (N pro , p7, NS2-3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B) [1] [2] [3] . The 5 1 -UTR contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that is responsible for translation initiation of the viral genome [4] . The 3 1 -UTR is in charge of regulating the pestiviral genome replication [5, 6] .

The CSFV NS5A comprises 497 amino acids and is a component of the replication complex. The conserved sequence C2717-C2740-C2742-C2767 in the NS5A protein has been proved to be important for viral growth and RNA synthesis [7] . It has been shown that NS5A regulates viral RNA replication through binding to NS5B (viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRp] ) and 3 1 -UTR [8] . The NS5A protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV), another member of the family Flaviviridae, is an essential component of the replication complex [9] and plays a role in regulating cellular and viral mRNA translation [10, 11] . The HCV NS5A-Core interaction is critical for the subcellular localization of NS5A and the production of infectious virus [12] . The HCV NS5A also plays an essential role in the switch from genome replication to particle assembly [13, 14] . In addition, the CSFV NS5A decreases IRES-mediated translation in a dose-dependent manner and the key sites (K399, T401, E406 and L413) are also found in BVDV, BDV and HCV [15] . To date, studies have been focused on the roles of the CSFV NS5A protein in viral genomic replication and translation [8, 15] , but knowledge of NS5A-interacting host proteins and their impacts on CSFV replication is limited.

The eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), one of the most abundant protein synthesis factors, constitutes 1% to 4% of the total soluble proteins in actively dividing cells [16, 17] . The canonical function of eEF1A is to bind aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) in a GTP-dependent manner and deliver it to the A site on the ribosome during protein synthesis [18] . eEF1A is also involved in non-canonical functions including turnover of misfolded proteins, nuclear export events, binding and bundling of the actin cytoskeleton, apoptosis and the viral life cycle [19, 20] . eEF1A contains three well-defined domains: the domain I binds to GTP; the domain II binds to the aminoacyl end of aa-tRNA, the domains I and II bind to the eEF1B complex, and the domain III is linked to actin binding [19] .

Different groups of viruses, such as tombusvirus (TBSV), human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) and West Nile virus (WNV), utilize eEF1A as cofactor for viral transcription, translation and assembly. For TBSV, eEF1A facilitates the assembly of the TBSV replicase and stimulates minus-strand synthesis [21] . The HIV-1 Nef protein enhances the resistance to stress-induced apoptosis in primary human macrophages through the nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of eEF1A and tRNAs. Moreover, eEF1 complex subunits are critical HIV-1 reverse transcription cofactors [22, 23] . In addition, the BVDV NS5A was also shown to interact with eEF1A [24] . Considering CSFV, BVDV, HCV and WNV are all Flaviviridae members, we suppose that the CSFV NS5A protein possibly interacts with eEF1A or affects the CSFV growth in host cells. In this study, we identified the host protein eEF1A as a novel NS5A-interacting partner that negatively regulates the growth of CSFV.

In the yeast two-hybrid screen, only one protein, eEF1A, was identified to be a potential binding protein for NS5A ( Figure 1A ). To confirm the interaction between NS5A and eEF1A, glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assay was performed with the GST-tagged NS5A protein expressed in Escherichia coli and the Myc-tagged eEF1A protein expressed in HEK293T cells. The results showed that GST-NS5A but not GST interacts with eEF1A ( Figure 1B ). To further verify the interaction between NS5A and eEF1A, coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay was performed with HEK293T cells overexpressing 3ˆFlag-tagged NS5A and Myc-tagged eEF1A. After incubation with anti-Flag monoclonal antibody (MAb) and Protein G-Agarose, the Myc-tagged eEF1A was found to coprecipitate with the 3ˆFlag-tagged NS5A ( Figure 1C) . Furthermore, the 3ˆFlag-tagged NS5A was shown to coprecipitate with Myc-eEF1A when the cell lysate was incubated with anti-Myc MAb and Protein G-Agarose ( Figure 1D ). Considering that both eEF1A and NS5A show a strong affinity for nucleic acids, we investigated whether the NS5A-eEF1A interaction might be mediated through a nonspecific RNA bridge. The results showed that the NS5A-eEF1A interaction was not influenced by RNase treatment, indicating that the interaction is not due to nonspecific RNA-mediated binding ( Figure 1E ). To examine the colocalization of NS5A protein with eEF1A, the subcellular localization of 3ˆFlag-NS5A and Myc-eEF1A was examined by confocal microscopy. Both 3ˆFlag-NS5A and Myc-eEF1A were colocalized in the cytoplasm ( Figure 1F ). Taken together, the results demonstrated that eEF1A is an interacting partner of the CSFV NS5A protein.

To determine which domain(s) of eEF1A is responsible for the association with NS5A, a series of Myc-tagged deletion mutants of eEF1A were constructed ( Figure 2A ) and tested for the interaction with NS5A by Co-IP assay. The results showed that eEF1A(1-133) and eEF1A(1-237) were capable of binding NS5A ( Figure 2B ), indicating that the domain I is critical for the NS5A-eEF1A interaction. in a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system. Yeast Y2HGold strain was cotransformed with pGBKT7-NS5A (BD-NS5A) as a bait and pGADT7-eEF1A (AD-eEF1A) as a prey. As a positive control, pGBKT7-p53 (BD-p53) and pGADT7-T (AD-T) were cotransformed into Y2HGold strain. Cotransformation of pGBKT7-Lamin C (BD-Lamin C) and AD-T was used as a negative control. All the yeast colonies cotransformed with the above plasmids were grown on synthetically defined (SD) medium lacking His and Leu (SD/-2), SD medium lacking His, Leu, Trp and Ade (SD/-4) and SD/-4 medium containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-D-galactopyranoside (X-α-Gal) and aureobasidin A (Aba) (SD/-4/X-α-Gal/Aba); (B) Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assay. The GST or GST-NS5A fusion proteins expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) were purified with glutathione Sepharose 4B resin and incubated with the lysate of HEK293T cells overexpressing the Myc-tagged eEF1A. After washing with cold PBS, the bound proteins were subjected to sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (10%) and Western blotting using the anti-GST polyclonal antibody (PAb) (1:2000) and the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (MAb) (1:1000); (C) Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) analysis of Myc-tagged eEF1A and Flag-tagged NS5A. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the indicated plasmids (+) or empty vectors (-) for 48 h. The transfected cells were lyzed and incubated with a mouse anti-Flag MAb, followed by incubation with the Protein G-Agarose for 6 h at 4˝C. The immunoprecipitate was analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-Flag MAb (1:1000) and a rabbit anti-Myc PAb (1:500); (D) Co-IP analysis of eEF1A and NS5A by the anti-Myc MAb. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the indicated plasmids (+) or empty vectors (´), the cell lysate was collected at 48 h post-transfection (hpt), incubated with the anti-Myc MAb and Protein G-Agarose. The immunoprecipitate was examined by Western blotting using the anti-Flag MAb (1:1000) and the anti-Myc PAb (1:500); (E) Effects of RNase A/T1 treatment on the NS5A-eEF1A interaction. Extracts of HEK293T cells overexpressing different proteins were treated or untreated with RNase A/T1 for 1 h prior to Co-IP and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. The total RNA in the immunoprecipitate was visualized by ethidium bromide-staining; (F) Colocalization of NS5A protein with eEF1A. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with p3ˆFlag-NS5A and pMyc-eEF1A. Cells were fixed at 48 hpt and subjected to indirect immunofluorescence assay to detect 3ˆFlag-NS5A (green) and Myc-eEF1A (red) with mouse anti-Flag and rabbit anti-Myc antibodies. The position of the nucleus is indicated by DAPI (blue) staining in the merged image. Samples were imaged and magnified 630 times on the Leica SP2 confocal system fitted with a 63ˆobjective lens. Scale bar = 7.5 µm. 

To investigate the effects of eEF1A on the CSFV replication, stable PK-15 cell line overexpressing EGFP-eEF1A (PK-EGFP-eEF1A) or EGFP (PK-EGFP) was generated and infected with the CSFV Shimen strain at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. The N pro expression in the CSFV-infected PK-EGFP-eEF1A cells was decreased at 48 and 72 h post-infection (hpi), compared with that in the PK-EGFP cells ( Figure 3A ,B). Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that the viral genome copies in the PK-EGFP-eEF1A cells were also reduced at 48 and 72 hpi, compared with the PK-EGFP cells ( Figure 3C ). Additionally, yields of infectious virus in culture supernatant of PK-EGFP-eEF1A cells were decreased at 48 and 72 hpi ( Figure 3D ). The results indicated the eEF1A negatively modulates the CSFV replication.

To further determine the effects of eEF1A on CSFV replication, recombinant lentiviruses expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against eEF1A (sheEF1A) or non-targeting negative control shRNA (shNC) were generated and transduced into PK-15 cells, resulting in efficient knockdown of the eEF1A expression ( Figure 4A ). Twenty-four hours after lentivirus-mediated shRNAs transduction, PK-15 cells were infected with the CSFV Shimen strain at an MOI of 0.1. The viral replication was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR, virus titration and Western blotting. In comparison with the shNC control, the viral genome copies in the eEF1A-knocked down cells were increased at 48 and 72 hpi ( Figure 4A ). Similarly, the CSFV titers were significantly increased after eEF1A knockdown in PK-15 cells ( Figure 4B) , and the N pro protein expression in the sheEF1A-transduced cells was increased at 48 and 72 hpi ( Figure 4C ). The results indicate that the eEF1A negatively modulates the CSFV replication.

Viruses 2015, 7 7 were generated and transduced into PK-15 cells, resulting in efficient knockdown of the eEF1A expression ( Figure 4A ). Twenty-four hours after lentivirus-mediated shRNAs transduction, PK-15 cells were infected with the CSFV Shimen strain at an MOI of 0.1. The viral replication was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR, virus titration and Western blotting.

The results indicate that the eEF1A negatively modulates the CSFV replication. 

A previous study showed that NS5A decreases the CSFV IRES-mediated translation in a dose-dependent manner [13] . To examine the effects of eEF1A on the NS5A-mediated inhibition of the CSFV IRES activity, the luciferase reporter assay was used in this study. The results showed that eEF1A ( Figure 5A ), as well as NS5A ( Figure 5B ), inhibited the CSFV IRES activity in a dose-dependent manner. To further investigate the inhibitory effects of eEF1A and NS5A coexpression, eEF1A-and NS5A-expressing plasmids were cotransfected with the luciferase reporter plasmids into HEK293T cells. The results indicated that the eEF1A did not antagonize the inhibition of the IRES activity by NS5A when NS5A and eEF1A were coexpressed ( Figure 5C ).

HEK293T cells were transfected with pMyc-eEF1A, pMyc-NS5A or pCMV-Myc. The cell lysate was incubated with the biotinylated CSFV IRES or PRRSV 3ʹ-UTR, followed by incubation with streptavidin beads. Bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (MAb) (1:1000); (B) eEF1A interacts with the CSFV IRES in a dose-dependent manner. HEK293T cells grown in the 6-well plate were transfected with an increased amount of pMyc-eEF1A (0, 1, 2 and 4 μg), followed by streptavidin pulldown assay as described above; (C) Competitive RNA pulldown assay. HEK293T cells grown in the 6-well plate were transfected with the indicated pMyc-eEF1A (4 μg). The cell lysate was incubated with an increased amount of the IRES RNA (0, 0.75, 1.5 and 3.0 μg) for 1 h at 4 °C and incubated with the biotinylated IRES RNA and streptavidin beads. Bound proteins were subjected to immunoblotting using the anti-Myc MAb. or pMyc-NS5A. The cell lysate was incubated with the biotinylated CSFV IRES or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) 3 1 -UTR, followed by incubation with streptavidin beads. The bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (MAb) (1:1000); (B) eEF1A interacts with the CSFV IRES in a dose-dependent manner.

HEK293T cells grown in the 6-well plate were transfected with the indicated pMyc-eEF1A (4 µg).

The bound proteins were subjected to immunoblotting using the anti-Myc MAb.

The observation that overexpression of eEF1A resulted in the inhibition of the CSFV IRES activity prompted an examination of the interaction between eEF1A and IRES of CSFV. Streptavidin pulldown assay showed that the biotinylated CSFV IRES, but not the biotinylated porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) 3 1 -UTR, could bind to eEF1A in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 6A,B) . Competitive RNA pulldown assay indicated that the association of eEF1A with the CSFV IRES could be inhibited by the unlabeled CSFV IRES ( Figure 6C ). The results demonstrated that eEF1A binds to the CSFV IRES and inhibits its activity.

The CSFV NS5A functions as the modulation of viral RNA replication via interacting with NS5B and 3 1 -UTR [8] . In addition, the NS5A protein can inhibit the IRES-mediated translation through binding to the IRES located in the 5 1 -UTR. A previous study showed that the NS5A-interacting cellular proteins were screened using Y2H analysis, and the identified proteins are mostly related to gene transcription, protein degradation, protein folding and metabolism [26] . Recently, heat shock protein 70 has been identified to interact with the CSFV NS5A and enhance viral RNA replication [27] . In this study, eEF1A was identified as a novel NS5A partner and a negative regulator of CSFV replication. eEF1A had not been identified in the previous study, probably due to the different cell types (endothelial cells vs. primary macrophages) used to construct the cDNA library [26] . We showed that NS5A and eEF1A were colocalized in the cytoplasm. As NS5A is the component of the replication complex, whether eEF1A is also localized in the replication complex needs further investigation.

The domain I of eEF1A was shown to be critical for the NS5A-eEF1A interaction, implying that it may be a potential target of anti-CSFV strategies. We also showed that eEF1A was able to bind to the IRES located in the 5 1 -UTR and inhibit its activity. In addition, we investigated the effects of eEF1A on the inhibition of the IRES activity by NS5A; however, we demonstrated that eEF1A did not antagonize the inhibition of the IRES activity by NS5A, indicating that NS5A and eEF1A perhaps bind to distinct parts of the IRES.

Several viral proteins have been observed to associate with eEF1A. The nucleocapsid protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) could modulate cell cytokinesis and proliferation via interacting with eEF1A [28] . eEF1A also interacts with the nucleocapsid protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and regulates the virus replication [29] . Furthermore, eEF1A can be utilized as the cofactors of the viral RNA synthesis for several viruses, such as HIV-1 [22, 23] , TBSV [21] and WNV [30] . Previous studies on turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and TBSV have shown that eEF1A interacts primarily with the viral RdRp complex, and thus acts as a chaperone and supports viral replication [31] [32] [33] . As members of Flaviviridae, both BVDV NS5A and HCV NS4A interact with eEF1A [24, 34] . Thereinto, the exact role of eEF1A on the BVDV replication remains unclear [24] . The HCV NS4A inhibits the viral IRES-mediated translation, and the translation inhibitory effect of NS4A was relieved by the addition of purified recombinant eEF1A in the in vitro translation system [34] . However, we showed here that eEF1A negatively regulates the CSFV growth. We conclude that the different roles of eEF1A in viral replication may vary depending on the distinct interactions between eEF1A and different viruses. In this study, the eEF1A was shown to bind to the IRES and inhibit its activity, thus it is possible to suppress the CSFV replication.

Since eEF1A binds to aa-tRNA among mammalian RNA species [35] , it is possible for eEF1A to bind to the similar RNA structures located in 5 1 -or 3 1 -UTR of the viral genome. It has been shown that interaction between eEF1A and the 3 1 -terminal stem-loop of the WNV genomic RNA facilitates the viral minus-strand RNA synthesis [30, 36, 37] . In the present study, we demonstrated that eEF1A binds to IRES located in the 5 1 -UTR of CSFV. Whether eEF1A binds to 3 1 -UTR of CSFV and influences RNA replication requires further study. We showed that eEF1A inhibits CSFV growth and reduces IRES activity of CSFV. Thus, we speculate that eEF1A affects the process of the viral protein translation via interacting with the CSFV IRES.

In summary, we demonstrated that eEF1A interacts with NS5A and negatively modulates the CSFV growth. The possible mechanism of the negative effect of eEF1A on the CSFV growth is that eEF1A interacts with the CSFV IRES and inhibits its activity. Further studies are needed to define the detailed interplay among eEF1A, NS5A and IRES in the life cycle of CSFV.

PK-15 or SK6 cells (porcine kidney cell lines) and HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) confirmed to be free of BVDV and anti-BVDV antibodies. The CSFV Shimen strain was propagated in PK-15 or SK6 cells. Viral titers in the culture supernatant of CSFV-infected cells were determined as described previously [38] . Table 1 . Primers used in this study.

Sequences ( 

The swine eEF1A gene (GenBank accession no. NM_001097418.2) and its various domains were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pCMV-Myc vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA) to generate pMyc-eEF1A, pMyc-eEF1A(1-333), pMyc-eEF1A(1-237), pMyc-eEF1A(238-462) and pMyc-eEF1A(201-333), respectively. The CSFV NS5A gene (GenBank accession no. EU497410.1) was amplified by PCR and cloned into the p3ˆFlag-CMV-10 vector (Sigma-Aldrich, ST. Louis, MO, USA) or pCMV-Myc to generate p3ˆFlag-NS5A or pMyc-NS5A. The primers for amplifying eEF1A and NS5A genes are listed in Table 1 .

A Matchmaker two-hybrid system (catalog no. 630489; Clontech) was used to screen host proteins that interact with NS5A. Briefly, the bait construct pGBKT7-NS5A (BD-NS5A) was transformed into the yeast strain Y2HGold and hybridized with a cDNA library derived from porcine macrophages [39] . Transformants were selected for growth on synthetically defined (SD) medium lacking His, Leu, Trp and Ade (SD/-4) for 3 to 6 days at 30˝C. The clones were then transferred to SD/-4 medium containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-D-galactopyranoside (X-α-Gal) and aureobasidin A (Aba) (SD/-4/X-α-Gal/Aba). Blue colonies were selected and inoculated with 5 mL of SD/-4 medium for shaking culture at 30˝C for 1 to 3 days. Yeast plasmids were extracted using a yeast plasmid kit (catalog no. D3376; Omega, Guangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the target inserts were verified by sequencing using the Gal4 AD and 3 1 AD primers. To validate the interaction between NS5A and the cellular proteins, the bait and prey plasmids were cotransformed into the Y2HGold yeast strain using a yeast transformation system 2 (catalog no. 630439; Clontech). The interaction between murine p53 and SV40 large T-antigen was used as a positive control, and the human lamin C protein, which does not interact with the SV40 large T-antigen, was included as a negative control.

HEK293T cells grown in 6-well plates (Nunc, Waltham, MA, USA) were cotransfected with 5 µg of pMyc-eEF1A and 3 µg of p3ˆFlag-NS5A using an X-tremeGENE HP DNA transfection reagent (catalog no. 06366236001; Roche, Penzberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cells were transfected with 400 µL of serum-free DMEM containing 8 µg of plasmids and 12 µL of X-tremeGENE HP DNA transfection reagent. At 6 h post-transfection (hpt), the transfection mixture was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and incubated for an additional 48 h before being assayed.

For expression of the GST-tagged NS5A protein, the NS5A gene was subcloned into the pGEX-6p-1 vector (catalog no. 28-9546-48; GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA), creating pGEX-NS5A. The GST or GST-NS5A fusion protein expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) were purified with the glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (catalog no. 10049253; GE Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Briefly, the expression of GST or GST-NS5A protein was induced by addition of 1 mM isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG) (catalog no. ST098; Beyotime, Shanghai, China). The bacterial cells were harvested and resuspended in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mg/mL protease inhibitor cocktail (catalog no. 11873580001; Roche, Penzberg, Germany), followed by mild sonication. Insoluble components were removed by centrifugation at 10,000ˆg for 20 min. Subsequently, the soluble GST or GST-NS5A protein was incubated with the glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin for 4 h at 4˝C. The resins were washed four times with cold PBS and incubated with 300 µL of the lysate of the HEK293T cells transfected with pMyc-eEF1A for 2 h at 4˝C. After an extensive wash with PBS, the bound proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by immunoblotting using the anti-Myc MAb (1:1000) (catalog no. M4439; Sigma-Aldrich) and an anti-GST polyclonal antibody (PAb) (1:2000) (catalog no. AB101; Tiangen, Beijing, China).

For Co-IP assay, the p3ˆFlag-NS5A and pMyc-eEF1A were cotransfected into HEK293T cells as described above. The cells were collected at 48 hpt, washed two times with cold PBS, and lyzed with the CHAPS lysis buffer (1% CHAPS, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 and 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5]) containing 1 mM PMSF (catalog no. ST506; Beyotime) and 1 mg/mL protease inhibitor cocktail at 4˝C for 1 h. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 13,000ˆg for 20 min at 4˝C. The clarified lysate was treated with a mixture of RNase A (25 U/mL) (catalog no. 2158; TaKaRa, Dalian, China) and RNase T1 (1 U/µL) (catalog no. PF0059; Fermentas, Burlington, Canada) for 1 h at room temperature prior to Co-IP analysis. The lysate was precleared with the Protein G-Agarose (catalog no. 11243233001; Roche) at 4˝C for 4 h followed by incubation with the indicated antibodies at 4˝C for 4 h, and the Protein G-Agarose was then added and incubated at 4˝C for 2 h. The Protein G-Agarose was washed three times with PBS, and the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using the indicated antibodies.

HEK293T cells were cotransfected with pMyc-eEF1A (3 µg) and p3ˆFlag-NS5A (2 µg). After 48-h incubation, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min. The cells were then incubated with an anti-Myc PAb (1:100) (catalog no. C3956; Sigma-Aldrich) or anti-Flag MAb (1:100) (catalog no. F1804; Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h.

The cells were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG (whole molecule)-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) antibody (1:100) (catalog no. F2012; Sigma-Aldrich) and goat anti-rabbit IgG (whole molecule)-tetramethyl rhodamine isocyanate (TRITC) antibody (1:100) (catalog no. T6778; Sigma-Aldrich). Subsequently, the cells were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (1:1000) (catalog no. D8417; Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min and examined using a Leica SP2 confocal system (Leica Microsystems, GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany).

To construct a stable cell line overexpressing eEF1A, the swine eEF1A gene was subcloned into the lentivirus vector pFUGW (Addgene, Cambridge, MA, USA). HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the recombinant plasmid pFUGW-eEF1A or the empty vector pFUGW, and the packaging plasmids psPAX2 (Addgene) and pMD2.G (Addgene). At 6 hpt, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 5% FBS. After 48-h incubation, the supernatant of the cell culture was harvested and ultra-centrifuged to concentrate the recombinant lentiviruses. Subsequently, PK-15 cells grown on 6-well plates were transduced with the lentiviruses of 10 transduction units (TU) per cell. The expression of EGFP-eEF1A in the transduced PK-15 cells was examined by Western blotting using a rabbit anti-eEF1A MAb (1:2000) (catalog no. ab157455; Abcam, Cambridge, UK).

To knock down the expression of eEF1A in PK-15 cells, a lentivirus vector-mediated shRNA targeting eEF1A was constructed. Briefly, the upper and lower sequences of shRNAs for eEF1A and non-targeting negative control (NC) are listed in Table 1 . The oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into the lentivirus vector pLVX-shRNA2 (Clontech). The resulting recombinant plasmids pLVX-eEF1A-shRNA1, pLVX-eEF1A-shRNA2 or pLVX-NC-shRNA were cotransfected with the packaging plasmids psPAX2 and pMD2.G into HEK293T cells in 10-cm cell dishes. At 48 hpt, the lentiviruses in the culture supernatant were concentrated at 6000ˆg for 20 min at 4˝C using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit with Ultracel-100 membrane (catalog no. UFC910096; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The lentiviuses were titrated and transduced into PK-15 cells as described above. Knockdown of eEF1A was validated by Western blotting using the anti-eEF1A MAb (1:2000).

Total RNA was extracted from the culture supernatant of CSFV-infected PK-15 cells using a TRIzol reagent (catalog no. 15596026; Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). The isolated RNA was then reverse transcribed to cDNA with reverse transcriptase XL (AMV) (catalog no. 2621; TaKaRa, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Genomic copies of CSFV were quantified by a real-time RT-PCR assay as described previously [25] . The experiment was carried out in triplicates.

In luciferase reporter assay, the reporter plasmid pFluc/IRES/Rluc [40] , a gift from Prof. Belsham, was used, which contains the firefly luciferase (Fluc) gene under the control of the T7 promoter and the renilla luciferase (Rluc) gene under the control of the CSFV IRES. The plasmid pLXSN-T7 expressing the T7 RNA polymerase [41] was also used in the assay. For the luciferase reporter assay, HEK293T cells grown on 24-well plates were cotransfected with 750 ng of pFluc/IRES/Rluc, 300 ng of pLXSN-T7 and different amounts of p3ˆFlag-NS5A or pMyc-eEF1A. After 48-h incubation, the reporter gene activity was analyzed with a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (catalog no. E1910; Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and measured with the TD-20/20 Luminometer (Turner Designs, Morgan Hill, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The data represent the Rluc activity normalized to the Fluc activity. Three independent experiments were carried out in duplicates.

The CSFV IRES or PRRSV 3 1 -UTR fragment was amplified and cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector to generate pcDNA-IRES or pcDNA-PRRSV-3 1 -UTR. Subsequently, the plasmids were linearized by EcoRV and transcribed in vitro using a RiboMAXTM large scale RNA production system (catalog no. P1300; Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting RNA was labeled with photobiotin (catalog no. A14216; Baoman, Shanghai, China) using a mercury vapor lamp for 30 min. HEK293T cells grown on 6-well plates were transfected with the indicated plasmids (pMyc-NS5A and pMyc-eEF1A) and lyzed with the lysis buffer. The lysate collected from two wells of the 6-well plate (lyzed with 150 µL of lysis buffer per well) was incubated with the biotinylated IRES RNA (2 µg) for 4 h at 4˝C, and then incubated with streptavidin beads (catalog no. 11205D; Invitrogen) for another 30 min at room temperature. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-Myc MAb (1:1000). For competitive RNA pulldown, the cell lysate was incubated with an increased amount of unlabeled IRES RNA (0, 0.75, 1.5 and 3 µg) for 1 h at 4˝C and then incubated with the biotinylated IRES and streptavidin beads. The experiments were carried out in triplicates.

Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 17.0 software. Student's t-test or one-way analysis of variance was used to compare the CSFV genomic copies. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant.

Foodborne Transmission of Deformed Wing Virus to Ants (Myrmica rubra)

Virus host shifts occur frequently, but the whole range of host species and the actual transmission pathways are often poorly understood. Deformed wing virus (DWV), an RNA virus described from honeybees (Apis mellifera), has been shown to have a broad host range. Since ants are often scavenging on dead honeybees, foodborne transmission of these viruses may occur. However, the role of the ant Myrmica rubra as an alternative host is not known and foodborne transmission to ants has not been experimentally addressed yet. Here, we show with a 16-week feeding experiment that foodborne transmission enables DWV type-A and -B to infect M. rubra and that these ants may serve as a virus reservoir. However, the titers of both plus-and minus-sense viral RNA strands decreased over time. Since the ants were fed with highly virus-saturated honeybee pupae, this probably resulted in initial viral peaks, then approaching lower equilibrium titers in infected individuals later. Since DWV infections were also found in untreated field-collected M. rubra colonies, our results support the wide host range of DWV and further suggest foodborne transmission as a so far underestimated spread mechanism. of honeybee viruses frequently happens, although it is not fully understood why and when pathogens jump between some species and not others [4, 15] .

The deformed wing virus (DWV) is a prevalent virus in honeybees with a broad host range spanning at least eight insect orders and three orders of Arachnida [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . This virus is a positive sense single-stranded RNA virus and a harmful honeybee pathogen [22] , of which at least three distinct genotypes or master variants-type A, B, and C-are known [21] . DWV can cause clinical symptoms such as crippled wings, a shortened abdomen, and a reduced host lifespan [22] [23] [24] . Driven by efficient vector transmission via ectoparasitic mites Varroa destructor, DWV has become ubiquitous [25] [26] [27] [28] .

Foodborne virus transmission appears to be less important in honeybees, but may be relevant for transmission to other species [21], especially for predators and scavengers [29] [30] [31] [32] . However, data on foodborne DWV transmission between honeybees and insect predators/scavengers are scarce.

Since virus-infected brood and adults are often expelled from honeybee colonies [33-36] and ants are often seen foraging such bees in apiaries (personal observations), it appears as if ants are very likely to consume DWV-infected food. However, there are only few studies on virus transmission between honeybees and ants. DWV and Kashmir Bee Virus (KBV) presence plus replication was detected in invasive argentine ants (Linepithema humile) as well as presence of Black queen cell virus (BQCV) in Linepithema humile and Anoplolepis gracilipes [37] [38] [39] . Further, DWV and other honeybee viruses (BQCV, Israeli acute paralysis virus and Sacbrood virus) were detected in Camponotus sp. ants [19] . Similarly, chronic bee paralysis virus seems to be able to replicate in ants Camponotus vagus [29] . So far, no study has yet experimentally addressed the efficacy of foodborne virus transmission between honeybees and predators/scavengers. Since ants are ubiquitous and play essential roles in terrestrial ecosystem functioning [40] [41] [42] [43] , virus transmission from managed honeybees might pose a considerable threat, given the virus is able to exploit the novel hosts. On the other hand, viruses and other pathogens may help limiting the spread of invasive M. rubra populations [37, 44] . Novel hosts can be biological vectors that support virus replication or reservoirs and mechanical vectors without virus replication [4] . Further, spillover events can also be bidirectional, from the novel host back to the initial host [1], possibly resulting in altered virulence and respective consequences as e.g., for influenza [45] .

Here, we empirically test for the first time whether ants, Myrmica rubra, which are common in Europe [46] and an invasive species in North America [47], can be alternative hosts of DWV and if foodborne transmission is feasible. Monitoring of viral loads after consumption of virus-infected food will shed light on the fate of the viruses. If negative-sense strands of the RNA viruses can be found, this would suggest virus replication [48, 49] .

Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) can cause a significant impact on human-and animal health [1] [2] [3] and are often the product of a host shift, where a pathogen jumps from its original host to new species [4] . Prominent examples include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus or the still ongoing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) pandemic [3] [4] [5] . Pathogens and their novel hosts lack a co-evolutionary history, which can lead to drastic effects on host populations [6] . In particular, RNA viruses have a high potential to cross species barriers because of high mutation rates that enable fast adaptive changes [7, 8] , which make them prominent among EIDs [9] . Such RNA viruses have also been suggested to contribute to the recent decline of wild pollinators and losses of managed ones, thereby potentially endangering valuable pollination services [10] [11] [12] [13] . Thus, it is not surprising that virus transmission between managed honeybees, Apis mellifera, and wild bees has recently been speculated [14, 15] .

The transmission potential of honeybee viruses between bees and other ecosystem service providing insects has received considerably less attention [16] . It appears as if cross-species transmission

Fifteen M. rubra colonies, collected in their founding stage around Berlin, Germany, were purchased from https://www.antstore.net/shop/de [50] . These colonies were kept in nesting tubes (155 mm length, 14 inner diameters) and fed with Drosophila hydei and sugar-water ad libitum (40% mass fraction of sugar). For the experiment, the colonies were transferred into boxes (60 × 70 × 15 mm) attached to a foraging arena (200 × 150 × 120 mm). Humidity in the nest was maintained with a moist cotton ball. Red foil covered the nest boxes to reduce stress [51] . The foraging arenas had an opening covered with removable insect nets and the edges were covered with paraffin oil to minimize escape. The colonies were maintained at RT (19-23 • C) with a natural day/night cycle.

White-eyed honeybee pupae were obtained from sealed worker brood frames of two local A. mellifera colonies and then microinjected laterally between the second and third segment of the abdomen with 2 µL of a solution containing DWV [52] . The pupae were then incubated at 34.5 • C, ≥50% relative humidity and darkness for seven days [53] and afterward frozen at −80 • C. The DWV solution was prepared by homogenizing a DWV symptomatic honeybee in PBS and chloroform, followed by centrifugation (15800 rcf for 10 min). The supernatant was collected, diluted 1:1000, and frozen at −80 • C before injection into the pupae [52] . For the injected honeybee pupae used as food and positive controls for the virus detection, the logarithmic mean number of viral copies was 11.49 ± 0.29 and DWV type-specific primers showed a ratio of 5.88/1 for DWV-B to DWV-A, but no DWV-C.

After four weeks, the colonies were randomly assigned to three treatments, differing in DWV infected protein supply over eight-weeks: (1) The controls (C, N = 3) were fed with D. hydei ad libitum;

(2) treatment 1 (T1) colonies (N = 6) were fed for four weeks with DWV-infected honeybee pupae and then for eight weeks with D. hydei; (3) treatment 2 (T2) colonies (N = 6) were fed for eight weeks with DWV infected honeybee pupae and for 4 weeks with D. hydei. D. hydei were chosen as food for the controls, because honeybee pupae taken from local Swiss colonies inevitably contain background levels of DWV [54] . Sugar water (40% mass fraction of sugar) supply ad libitum was maintained. Then, ten adult workers were randomly sampled from each colony over four consecutive weeks until the end of the experiment (week [13] [14] [15] [16] and stored at −80 • C until further processing. The different feeding regimes were chosen to see if there is an impact of feeding duration on virus uptake and the time gap since the last feeding of the virus until the first sampling should reduce the risk of detecting DWV in the ant's gut content [55, 56] . Some colonies were not large enough to provide adults, thereby decreasing sample size at the last sampling (C -N = 1; T1 -N = 5; T2 -N = 6).

For the quantification of viral titers a pooled sample of five workers per sampling week was crushed in 100 µL TN buffer (100 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.6) with a 5-mm metal bead in 2-mL Eppendorf ® (Basel, Switzerland) tubes using a Retsch ® (Haan, Germany) MM 300 mixer mill for 1 min at the frequency 25 1/s [57] . Injected honeybee pupae extracted as well as positive controls using 200 µL TN buffer. Fifty microliters of the homogenate was transferred to 1.5-mL Eppendorf ® tubes and the RNA extraction was done using a NucleoSpin ® RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel, Oensingen, Switzerland) following the manufacturer's recommendations. In the final step, RNA was eluted in 30 µL of elution buffer and stored at −80 • C [57] . To monitor the efficiency of the RNA purification and cDNA synthesis, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV, 1 µL TMV solution (1:1000)) was used as an exogenous internal reference added to each sample at the first step of the RNA extraction [58] .

For the reverse transcription, we used the M-MLV RT (Promega, Dübendorf, Switzerland) Kit and followed the manufacturer's recommendations: Template RNA (50-500 µg, Table S1 ) was incubated with 0.75 µL of a random hexamer oligonucleotide (100 µM) and H 2 O for 5 min at 70 • C in a thermocycler (Biometra; Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany). For the cDNA synthesis, 5 µL 5× buffer, 1.125 µL nucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) 10 mM and 1 µL reverse transcriptase (M-MLV) was added to a final reaction volume of 25 µL, which was incubated at 37 • C for 60 min. The resulting cDNA was diluted 1/5 and stored at −25 • C until further processing.

The RT-qPCR was performed in duplicate for each sample using the KAPA SYBR ® FAST Universal qPCR kit (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, DE, USA) with 12 µL volumes containing 6 µL KAPA SYBR ® (Wilmington, DE, USA) green reaction mix, 0.24 µL each of the forward and reverse primers for DWV or TMV (Table 1) , 2.52 µL H 2 O and 3 µL diluted cDNA [52] . An ECO™ real-time PCR machine (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) processed the reaction at the following qPCR cycling profile: 3 min incubation at 95 • C and 40 cycles of 3 s at 95 • C for denaturation, 30 s at 57 • C for annealing and extension, and data collection. By reading the fluorescence at 0.5 • C intervals between 55 • C and 95 • C, a melting curve analysis was performed after the amplification to verify the specificity of the PCR products. On each plate, a ten-folds serial dilution of purified PCR products that served as standard curves for DWV and TMV and two no-template negatives were included [59] . From the q-PCR output data, the standard curves and the experimental dilution factors viral titers respectively estimated viral copies per sample were derived [60] . To account for the exponential distribution of the data, virus titers were log-transformed and throughout the manuscript, the logarithmic values of the viral titers are reported. Because it is not possible to log transform zero values of negative samples we assigned to them a hypothetical Cq value of 36, which was transformed to virus titers as above. From the averaged value of these "negative titers," we obtained the titer detection threshold [61] . Table 1 . Primers used during qPCR for the detection and quantification of deformed wing virus (DWV) and minus strand-specific PCR as a proxy for viral replication as well as the DWV type-specific (A, B, and C) primers. 

The detection of the negative-sense strand RNA was used as a token of DWV replication [48, 49] . First, the negative-sense strand RNA was tagged and then amplified: The cDNA of all T1 and T2 colonies sampled at Week 13 and 16 were obtained by using Superscript ® III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's recommendations (1 µL of DWV 3F tagged primer, Table 1 , 1 µL dNTP 10 mM, 4 µL of 5× first strand buffer, 2 µL 0.1 M DTT, 1 µL M-MLV reverse transcriptase, H 2 O and sample in a final reaction volume of 20 µL) [52] . The reaction was processed in a thermocycler (Biometra; Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany) according to the following protocol: 5 min at 65 • C, 10 min at 25 • C, 60 min at 50 • C followed by 15 min at 70 • C. The obtained cDNA then was purified using the NucleoSpin ® Gel & PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel) and eluted in 30 µL elution buffer to avoid false-positive results. A five-fold dilution of the purified cDNA was used for the subsequent amplification with conventional PCR (MyTay™ kit by Bioline, London, UK). DWV-R1 was used as the reverse primer, while a Tag oligonucleotide (Table 1 ) was used as forward primer. For each sample, a second reaction was carried out without forward primer to check for efficient removal of DWV 3F tagged primer after the reverse transcription. The thermal cycling was done with a profile that consisted of 2 min incubation at 95 • C and 35 cycles of 20 s at 95 • C for denaturation, 20 s at 42 • C for annealing, and 30 s at 72 • C for extension. By electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel, the PCR products were analyzed and visually checked under UV light. If a clear band was present at 221 bp and the associated negative control was indeed negative, a sample was considered positive.

All statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.5.1 [64] and R Studio version 1.1.456 [65] . Data were checked for normality with the Shapiro-Wilk test and homogeneity of variances with the Levene's test and subsequent statistical tests chosen accordingly. We used the lmer function from the package lme4 [66] to perform a linear mixed effect analysis to test for differences of viral titers over time between the treatments. The logarithm of the viral titers entered the model as a response variable. As fixed effects, we used sampling week and treatment including their interaction term. As a random effect, we added the colony identity to control for multiple testing of the same colonies (week [13] [14] [15] [16] . Visual inspection of residual plots did not reveal deviations from homoscedasticity or normality. p-values were obtained by comparing the model with the effect in question against the model without it, using an ANOVA as a likelihood ratio test. The post-hoc pairwise comparison was then performed using the Bonferroni correction.

All the samples from T1 (colonies fed for four weeks with DWV-infected honeybee pupae) and T2 (colonies fed for eight weeks with DWV-infected honeybee pupae) were strongly positive, with two exceptions (one pooled sample each during week 13 and 15). With 4.17/1 (T1) and 5.46/1 (T2), the ratio of DWV type-B to type-A was similar to the one in the feeding pupae (5.88/1 for DWV-B to DWV-A). Sequencing of the PCR products confirmed the identity of both DWV strains found in M. rubra (GenBank accession: DWV-A, JF346565.1, 99.73% identity, 100% query cover; DWV-B, AY251269.2, 98.84% identity, 99% query cover). The viral titers found in ants were in the range of 6.46-9.66 with a log mean of 7.95 ± 0.72 for T1, 6.17-10.18, 8.26 ± 1.02 for T2, and 3.17-5.88, 4.22 ± 0.85 in the control group seen over all weeks ( Figure 1 , Table 2 ). Viral titers in ants were significantly affected by the factors treatment (X 2

(2) = 42.39, p < 0.001) and sampling week (X 2 (1) = 38.43, p < 0.001), including their interaction term (X 2

(2) = 8.12, p < 0.017). Viral titers of both treatment groups were significantly higher than in the control group (p < 0.0001, Bonferroni post hoc test), but there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups (p = 0.53, Bonferroni post hoc test). The significant interaction between treatment and sampling week indicates that the slope of the viral titer decrease was dependent on treatment. 9.47 ± 0.51 [6] 8.47 ± 0.48 [6] 8.01 ± 0.65 [6] 7.12 ± 0.65 [6] 3.

The presence of the negative-sense strand of DWV, as indicated by a band at 221 bp of the agarose gel electrophoresis [49, 52] was confirmed for all colonies of T1 at week 13, but only for two colonies at week 16 ( Figure 2) . Similarly, the band at 221 bp was clearly visible in all but one colony of T2 at the first sampling point. Four weeks later, the band was still well visible in one colony, less pronounced in two others, and not visible in three colonies. 

Our results suggest that the ant M. rubra can be an alternative host for both DWV A and B as a result of foodborne transmission because of the presence of both high viral titers and the negative-sense RNA strand for up to 13 weeks after the last virus-infected food has been consumed. These results further support that DWV has a wide host range including other predatory insects [14, 15, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [29] [30] [31] [32] 37] . Interestingly, there were only two ant species from the family Formicidae among the more than 60 species in which DWV has been detected so far [21] . It is obvious that recently consumed highly virus infected food like honeybee pupae, containing the virus negative-sense strand, might lead to false positive results simply because of the presence of viral particles in ant's gut. Because of the delayed sampling, we can however expect that the gut content of the ants has been cleared out at least once before the virus analyses [55] .

The experimental data show that foodborne transmission, e.g., via consumption of infected honeybees, can be an underlying mechanism, which enables DWV to infect M. rubra and potentially other arthropod predators and scavengers [29] [30] [31] [32] 37] . Indeed, both treatment groups that were fed with virus-infected honeybee pupae had consistently higher viral titers than the controls. Since symptomatic honeybees with an overt infection have 10 10+ genomic equivalents of DWV and at lower infection levels 10 3 -10 9 genomic copies [67] , the titers observed in M. rubra seem to reflect covert infections. However, the average honeybee worker (~120 mg) weights about 60 times more than a M. rubra worker [68, 69] . When controlled for these bodyweight differences, the DWV A and B titers found in the treatment groups therefore almost reach infection levels per mg ant-tissue analogous to an overt infection in bees. Further, the viral titers were very low in the control colonies, thereby indicating that DWV A and B were only replicating in the treatments. Interestingly, the ratios of DWV type-B to type-A were very similar in the ants, regardless of the treatment (4.17/1 (T1), 5.46/1 (T2), as well as in the injected honeybee pupae (5.88/1 for DWV-B to DWV-A), thereby suggesting that both strains had similar reproductive capacities in both hosts.

Over time, a decrease of both the viral titers and the presence of the negative-sense strand was observed in the treatment colonies. It may well be that the treatment colonies would eventually reach a low viral level such as the controls, display low level replication and at that both A and B strains are present. However, we have no data to address those questions. What could explain the observed decrease of viral titers over time? Neither altruistic self-removal of infected nestmates [70] nor increased mortality in the treatment colonies were observed. Therefore, the higher initial viral titers and the more common minus-strand presence could reflect virus particles consumed with the infected honeybee food. In light of ant physiology [71] , this is nevertheless unlikely to explain the comparatively high viral titers and especially the presence of the minus strand for up to 13 weeks after the last virus-infected food has been consumed. The most parsimonious explanation therefore is that the ants were fed with highly virus saturated honeybee pupae resulting in initial viral peaks, then approaching lower equilibrium titers in infected ant individuals later. In light of these results, it appears as if controlled laboratory experiments are required before drawing general conclusions on the role of predators/scavengers as alternative hosts of any honeybee viruses, i.e., the timing of the last virus-infected food consumption should be known. Similarly, the detection of the negative-sense strand in V. destructor suggested DWV replication in the mites until recently, when a non-propagative manner DWV transmission has been proposed [72] .

Given the prevalence and high titers of DWV and its wide host range [21] , it is not surprising that the field-collected control colonies were also tested positive for DWV at low levels. Since our experimental data clearly show that DWV transmission to ants is feasible via food, we assume that either (1) DWV-contaminated food must have been given to the ant colonies in captivity prior to our experiments or alternatively, but not mutually exclusive, (2) the D. hydei flies used as control food were DWV positive, which we regard as unlikely, or (3) the control colonies had consumed DWV-infected food prior to field-sampling by the company. Given the latter case, this would support the view that DWV transmission to M. rubra also occurs in the field, which would be in line with other studies showing the presence of viruses, originally described from honeybees, in ants [29, 37] . A closer look at the controls also reveals that the viruses are not equally distributed within these naturally infected colonies. It would be interesting to see if the uneven distribution is due to age-related division of labor and non-stochastic interaction patterns [73] , i.e., foragers might have a higher exposure risk compared to in-house workers. Considering the low viral titers in the controls, it is possible that the viruses persist in M. rubra as a covert infection that might turn into an overt infection under suitable conditions, e.g., parasite infections as in honeybees [26] .

Although the data suggest that DWV prevails and replicates in M. rubra and that it also occurs in field-collected samples, it provides no insights on pathogenicity. Neither abnormalities in colony development nor individual clinical symptoms in workers were observed. Additional studies are therefore required to understand if and how honeybee viruses might affect M. rubra or other predators/scavengers.

The data suggest for the first time that M. rubra is another biological host for DWV type-A and -B known from honeybees and that foodborne transmission is an underlying transmission mechanism. Since ants are ubiquitous and important in terrestrial ecosystems, it appears as if there is a considerable potential for virus transmission between wild insects and managed bees with possible consequences for ecosystem functioning. It has been suggested that viruses might offer novel options for the control of invasive ant species [37] . However, we consider such biocontrol suboptimal due to the evident wide host range of viruses and the here demonstrated considerable chances of host-switches, with possibly dramatic consequences [5] .

The objective of this study was to screen for antigens of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) to establish a new double antibody sandwich-lateral flow immunoassay (DAS-LFIA) method for testing the presence of anti-HCV antibodies in human serum or plasma. A series of different recombinant HCV proteins in Escherichia coli cells were constructed, expressed, purified and the new DAS-LFIA strip was developed. The sensitivity and specificity of new the DAS-LFIA strip were evaluated by detecting 23 HCV-positive sera, a set of quality control references for anti-HCV detection that contain known amounts of anti-HCV antibodies, and 8 HCV-negative sera. A total of 300 clinical serum samples was examined by both the new DAS-LFIA strip and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Data were analyzed using SPSS 11.5 software. The sensitivity and specificity of the new DAS-LFIA strip were 100%. The lowest test line of the HCV DAS-LFIA strips was 2 NCU/ml. Additionally, the concordance between the new DAS-LFIA strip and ELISA methods was 94.33%. In conclusion, our new testing method is rapid, simple, sensitive and specifically detects the presence of anti-HCV antibodies in human serum or plasma. Therefore, it may be used for monitoring HCV.

It is estimated that approximately 180 million people have been infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and approximately 130 million people are chronic HCV carriers (1).

HCV is a common cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide (2) (3) (4) . Currently, there are two main methods for detecting an HCV infection: one detects viral RNA by RT-PCR (5) (6) (7) (8) and the other detects HCV antibodies by immunoassay [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)] in serum (9, 10) . The sensitive ELISA assay uses recombinant viral proteins corresponding to multiple polypeptides from different viral regions, including structural proteins and non-structural polypeptides (11) (12) (13) . It can be used as a confirmation test. However, its usage is limited in the clinical setting as the procedure requires sophisticated laboratory equipment and there is a high probability of contamination. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to develop an affordable and reliable rapid lateral flow test to detect the presence of HCV antibodies in blood samples by screening for HCV antigens, which would help decrease the chances of HCV infection from blood transfusions.

Plasmids and bacterial strains. The p90/HCVFLlongpU plasmid carrying full-length coding sequences of HCV was a generous gift from Professor Charles M. Rice from the Center for the Study of Hepatitis C, Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA. The Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains, Jm109, DH5a and BL21 (DE3), were used as the cloning and expression hosts.

A panel of 23 standard positive sera, 8 standard negative sera, a set of quality control references for anti-HCV detection that contain known amounts of anti-HCV antibodies (Artron BioResearch Inc., Burnaby, BC, Canada) and 300 clinical sera were used for the antigenicity assessment of HCV proteins. Other reagents and instruments included goat anti-mouse HCV IgG polyclonal antibody, 30-60 nm colloidal gold particles (from Artron BioResearch Inc.), HCV-ELISA (KHB, Shanghai, China), a NanoDrop ® ND-1000 Spectrophotometer, a Bio-Rad BioLogic LP, ZQ4000 test strip cutter, and XYZ-3000 Bio-Dot (all from Bio-Rad, Shanghai, China).

Construction and expression of recombinant HCV antigens. To obtain the HCV antigens, the sequences encoding the desired A novel double antibody sandwich-lateral flow immunoassay for the rapid and simple detection of hepatitis C virus regions in the HCV genome were amplified by RT-PCR, and cloned into the prokaryotic expression vectors, pQE30 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), pET32a(+) (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), or pGEX-4T-2 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chalfont St. Giles, UK), in-frame downstream of the 6-His-tag or glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tag coding sequence. Primers used for the HCV PCR amplification are listed in Table I and the structures of the plasmids are illustrated in Fig. 1 . E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harbouring the HCV gene fragment were grown at 37˚C in LB medium containing 50 µg/ml of ampicillin to OD 600 = 0.8. The expression of the antigens was induced by adding isopropylβ-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 1 mmol/l. The cells were harvested 4-6 h later by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min and stored at -20˚C. Solubility analyses of expression products were performed as previously described (14) . Briefly, harvested bacteria were re-suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; containing 140 mmol/l NaCl, 2.7 mmol/l KCl, 10 mmol/l Na 2 HPO 4 , 1.8 mmol/l KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.3), sonicated on an ice-bath, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min at 4˚C. After centrifugation, the soluble and insoluble fractions were analyzed for the presence of expression products.

Purification of recombinant HCV antigens. To purify the expressed proteins, we chose to use a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity chromatography column for His-tagged proteins and a glutathione sepharose™ 4B column for GST-tagged proteins. The two methods are similar as regards experimental procedures but differ in column chromatography and reagents, as described below: i) Protein purification with Ni-NTA column. The column was first equilibrated with lysis buffer (50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, pH 7.8) at five times the volume of the beads. The sample was then loaded and allowed to flow slowly in order to maximize the amount of protein bound to the beads. The flow-through solution was collected for SDS-PAGE analysis later. After the sample was completely loaded, washing buffer (50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) was added to wash off unspecific proteins bound to the beads or remaining in the column until the OD 280 reading was below 0.100. The proteins of interest were eluted by adding elution buffer (50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, pH 8.0).

ii) Protein purification with glutathione sepharose 4B column. The general procedures were the same as those for the Ni-NTA columns, although the buffers used in the GST columns were different. PBS solution (pH 7.4) was used for equilibration. After the sample was loaded, the same PBS solution was used to wash the column. Finally, the glutathione solution (50 mM Tris-HCL, 10 mM reduced glutathione) was used to elute the protein of interest. All purified recombinant HCV antigens were found to be >90% pure based on SDS/polyacrylamide gel analysis followed by Coomassie blue staining. Eluents with high OD 280 were collected into a membrane bag and dialysis was performed overnight at 4˚C in a buffer (PBS buffer). Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as the standard.

Construction of double antigen sandwich-lateral flow immunoassay (DAS-LFIA) strip and indirect lateral flow immunoassay (I-LFIA). The DAS-LFIA device for the detection of anti-HCV antibodies was manufactured by Artron BioResearch Inc. First, we optimized the conditions for the colloidal gold conjugation of the purified antigen and the coating of the gold-conjugated recombinant protein on non-woven fabric sheets. Colloidal gold is used as an indicator for the presence of antigens binding to the membrane on the rapid lateral flow test strip. After the proteins are bound to colloidal gold to form the conjugate, the fabric sheets are placed in a dry room for at least 2 h for drying. Subsequently, the purified antigen, diluted in PBS, is coated on the test region. Simultaneously, HCV IgG polyclonal antibody, diluted in PBS, is coated on the control region. The coated membrane is dried for a minimum of 24 h and then blocked with a particular blocking solution. Finally, the test strip is assembled such that everything slightly overlaps in order to allow for the continuous lateral flow of the liquid sample. The test strip has an absorption pad, a strip of membrane, a conjugate fibre and other fibres to hold the conjugate fibre in place. Instructions on how to assemble a test strip were provided by Artron BioResearch Inc. The combination of the coating protein, conjugate protein, conjugate fibre and dialysis buffer forms a 'system' in a test strip. The test strip developed was tested with different positive and negative HCV sera. I-LFIA was manufactured using IgG antibody conjugating colloidal gold instead of antigen.

Test principle and assay procedure. Each test solution (50 µl) was pipetted onto the sample pad and driven to migrate by capillary action along the strip. If HCV antibodies were present in the serum or plasma, they would react with the colloidal goldconjugated antigen to form an antibody-antigen complex. This complex would flow through the absorbent device and bind to the antigen in the positive reaction test zone ('T' area), forming a gold-conjugated Ag-Ab-Ag sandwich complex, producing a pink-purple colored band. A colored band in the control region of the device indicates adequate sample volume and capillary action. The absence of a colored band in the control region is an indication of an invalid result. Positive results were read as soon as two colored bands appeared. Negative samples provided only one pink control band. If no control band was present, the test was considered invalid. Color formation for both reactions was complete after 5-10 min. A schematic representation of possible test results is shown in Fig. 2B .

Determination of sensitivity and specificity of the HCV strip. To assess the sensitivity of the HCV strip, a panel of 23 standard positive sera were simultaneously measured by the ELISA, DAS-LFIA, I-LFIA and RT-PCR methods. In addition, serial dilutions of a reference panel with known amounts of anti-HCV antibodies with a concentration from 8 NCU/ml (NCU meaning national clinical unit) to 0.5 NCU/ml were measured by the DAS-LFIA strip. To assess the specificity and accuracy the ddH 2 0, positive enhancement sample (a set of quality control references for anti-HCV antibody detection that contains known amounts of anti-HCV antibodies; Artron BioResearch Inc.), BS control and 8 HCV-negative patients were analyzed by the DAS-LFIA strip.

Detection of HCV antibodies in clinical specimens. A total of 300 clinical samples was analyzed by the new DAS-LFIA method as described above and the HCV ELISA test kit (Shanghai Huaguan Biochip Co., Ltd.) according to the supplier's instructions.

Statistical analysis. The statistical package SPSS 11.5 was used for data analysis. P-value ≤0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.

Construction of expression plasmids. For the expression of HCV proteins in E. coli, corresponding coding sequences were cloned into the histidine fusion expression vectors, pET32a(+) and pQE30, or the GST-tag expression vector, pGEX-4T-2, as shown in Table I and Fig. 1 . Recombinant plasmids were examined and confirmed by PCR amplification, restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. We successfully produced a set of recombinant proteins derived from HCV structural (core, E1 and E2) and non-structural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B) in BL21 (DE3) cells by using the E. coli expression system.

In order to obtain pure proteins, recombinant plasmids were used to transform E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells and expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG. The expressed proteins were purified with Ni 2+ -chelate affinity chromatography and a glutathione sepharose™ 4B column. Proteins were examined using SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3) . The position of the protein bands was consistent with the expected molecular weight of the different HCV segments. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA method, using BSA as the standard. Our further analyses demonstrated that the HCV proteins were pure and that they could be used directly for the construction of the HCV DAS-LFIA strip.

Analytical parameters of the optimized one-step strip. In the current study, we optimized the concentration of the coating Table I . Sequences of oligonucleotide primers that were used to validate the expression of several different HCV segment genes.

Primer sequences Primary description Enzyme site antigen, the amount of colloidal gold-labelled antigen on the conjugate pad, the characteristics of the materials used, the buffer systems, the additives, and the solvents applied to ensure that the assays ran successfully over the concentration range required (Table II) . (Table IV) . All antigens ran against negative samples did not show any signs of reactivity in comparison to the control test strip (Fig. 4) . This indicated that the HCV antigen did not cross-react with other common viral antibodies and thus, was highly specific to HCV.

Immunoassay of the 300 clinical specimens. A total of 300 samples was measured using the anti-HCV DAS-LFIA strip and anti-HCV ELISA immunoassays. In these 300 cases, we found that the rate of the anti-HCV DAS-LFIA strip and the ELISA-negative one was 78% (234/300). The rate of anti-HCV DAS-LFIA-negative but ELISA-positive was 2% (6/300). The rate of the anti-HCV DAS-LFIA-positive strip but the ELISAnegative one was 3.67% (11/300). The rate of the anti-HCV DAS-LFIA and ELISA-positive was 16.33% (49/300). The concordance between the ELISA and DAS-LFIA methods was 94.33%. The disagreement rate between the ELISA and DAS-LFIA methods was not significant (χ 2 = 0.941, P= 0.332) ( Table V) . 

In this present study, we characterized the immunoreactivity of recombinant HCV polypeptides derived from many different regions of the HCV polyprotein expressed in bacteria. The purpose of synthesizing these segments is to determine which segments encoded by the genome are significant for the development of anti-HCV assays and to find a multiple epitope fusion antigen which incorporates all of the major immunodominant epitopes from the functional regions of the HCV genome. Therefore, we first constructed the different HCV segments into vectors containing His-tag or GST-tag to induce expression. The proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3) cells as fusion proteins with a 26 kDa GST-tag or 18 kDa His-tag used for detection and affinity purification. The immunogenicity of the tagged fusion proteins was analyzed using HCV strip analysis with standard positive and negative anti-HCV sera. Our results showed that the recombinant soluble proteins were expressed successfully. The sera studied recognized the core and NS3 protein at very high levels, whereas the other proteins, such as NS4B, NS4A, NS5A and NS5B, were found to have lower levels of reactivity. The E2 protein rarely reacted with anti-HCV positive serum. Thus, the core protein in combination with a new NS3 protein (1183-1476 aa) constitutes almost all of the major immunogenic proteins of the HCV. However, this study does not exclude the possibility that the low reactivity to some HCV antigens is due to a quantitative reduction in the titer of antibodies and not due to an absence of reactivity.

To determine the contributions of various regions of the core protein and NS3 protein to infectivity diagnosis, clones of the core gene and different NS3 segments were expressed in E. coli cells and the recombinant proteins were used to test human anti-HCV-positive sera in the ELISA and the rapid lateral flow test strip. The data suggested that the full-length core protein and the new NS3 protein (1183-1476 aa) were suitable for analyzing the presence of antibodies against individual HCV proteins in human sera obtained from patients suffering from chronic HCV infection. These results are in agreement with those of previous studies in which the putative nucleocapsid protein (C) and non-structural proteins (NS3) were found to contain the most immunodominant epitopes (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) .

Several studies have indicated that a peptide spanning aa 2-120 of the C gene (C22) is a major component of the commercially available second-generation anti-HCV tests. Our study demonstrates that the full-length core protein has better reactivity than C22. It is possible that the C-terminal domain of the core protein contains key peptide sequences for constructing the viral particle and regulating viral assembly (4, 20) .

The HCV NS3 protein is composed of an amino terminal protease and a carboxyl terminal RNA helicase (21) . NS3 contains major antigenic epitopes and plays an important role in the diagnosis of HCV infection, particularly in early HCV infection (21) . In this study, to our knowledge, our results demonstrate for the first time that a new NS3 segment (1183-1476 aa) shows strong reactivity in 95.6% of RT-PCRpositive samples and can act as a potential tool for the diagnosis of HCV infection.

To achieve the greatest possible sensitivity and specificity, we chose two formats of gold-based immunoassays. In the double antigen sandwich immunoassay, the HCV antigen labelled with colloidal gold is a soluble recombinant antigen. During the test, HCV antibodies in the sample react with antigen coated on the nitrocellucose membrane and gold-HCV antigen conjugates, forming a gold-conjugated Ag-Ab-Ag sandwich complex. At the same time, we carried out a series of experiments to optimize different parameters, such as the amount of immunoreagents, the type of materials, and the composition of the blocking solution and detector reagent mixture. The experimental results demon- strated that the chromatographic strip device we constructed is simple, sensitive and specific. It is an ideal test for the screening of patients with HCV infection. The presence of recombinant core and NS3 antigens in the strip may be crucial for the detection of HCV-infected patients with low antibody titers.

In conclusion, we found that recombinant antigens encoded by different HCV gene fragments display different immunoreactivity to anti-HCV antibodies. Our data show the full-length core and NS3 (1183-1476 aa) proteins have the major immunodominant epitopes of the HCV genome. More importantly, our study verify that the full-length core and NS3 (1183-1476 aa) recombinant antigen can be used to construct a double antigen sandwich lateral-flow immunochromatographic anti-HCV immunoassay strip. This strip allows for the more rapid and more economical detection of HCV. It also has a high sensitivity and specificity in testing for HCV. It has the potential to become a useful tool for HCV clinical detection.

LeishVet update and recommendations on feline leishmaniosis

Limited data is available on feline leishmaniosis (FeL) caused by Leishmania infantum worldwide. The LeishVet group presents in this report a review of the current knowledge on FeL, the epidemiological role of the cat in L. infantum infection, clinical manifestations, and recommendations on diagnosis, treatment and monitoring, prognosis and prevention of infection, in order to standardize the management of this disease in cats. The consensus of opinions and recommendations was formulated by combining a comprehensive review of evidence-based studies and case reports, clinical experience and critical consensus discussions. While subclinical feline infections are common in areas endemic for canine leishmaniosis, clinical illness due to L. infantum in cats is rare. The prevalence rates of feline infection with L. infantum in serological or molecular-based surveys range from 0 % to more than 60 %. Cats are able to infect sand flies and, therefore, they may act as a secondary reservoir, with dogs being the primary natural reservoir. The most common clinical signs and clinicopathological abnormalities compatible with FeL include lymph node enlargement and skin lesions such as ulcerative, exfoliative, crusting or nodular dermatitis (mainly on the head or distal limbs), ocular lesions (mainly uveitis), feline chronic gingivostomatitis syndrome, mucocutaneous ulcerative or nodular lesions, hypergammaglobulinaemia and mild normocytic normochromic anaemia. Clinical illness is frequently associated with impaired immunocompetence, as in case of retroviral coinfections or immunosuppressive therapy. Diagnosis is based on serology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cytology, histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) or culture. If serological testing is negative or low positive in a cat with clinical signs compatible with FeL, the diagnosis of leishmaniosis should not be excluded and additional diagnostic methods (cytology, histology with IHC, PCR, culture) should be employed. The most common treatment used is allopurinol. Meglumine antimoniate has been administered in very few reported cases. Both drugs are administered alone and most cats recover clinically after therapy. Follow-up of treated cats with routine laboratory tests, serology and PCR is essential for prevention of clinical relapses. Specific preventative measures for this infection in cats are currently not available.

Leishmania infantum (syn. Leishmania chagasi) infection is found both in the Old and New Worlds with dogs as the main reservoir. Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is an important and complex zoonotic disease whose transmission, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, therapy and prevention have been extensively studied [1, 2] . Conversely, in the last century, the cat was usually considered as a relatively resistant host species to Leishmania infection based on two experimental studies (see Question 5) and on limited numbers of clinical case reports and histopathological descriptions of the presence of Leishmania infection in necropsies.

Historically, some studies have used cats for investigating their potential role as reservoir for Leishmania. Pet cats living in the same houses where human cases of cutaneous or visceral leishmaniosis were diagnosed were examined for the presence of Leishmania amastigotes in skin lesions or by post mortem histopathological evaluation of the bone marrow and spleen [3, 4] . In Sicily (southern Italy), no case of infection was found by cytological and histological examination of spleen, liver and bone marrow of 120 necropsied cats living in an endemic area [5] . The same negative results were obtained in Egypt when spleen cytology and culture were performed on 28 stray cats, and six of them displaying skin lesions were negative also from skin [6] . Conversely, in Jordan, amastigotes were detected in liver and spleen smears from about 20 % of 78 stray cats [7] .

The development of both feline medicine and more sensitive and specific diagnostic techniques such as serological and molecular methods has led in recent decades to an increasing number of documented case reports of feline leishmaniosis (FeL) and subclinical infections. However, there is still limited information on epidemiological and clinical aspects of Leishmania infection in cats which is all derived from descriptive studies, case reports, information from canine leishmaniosis cases and personal experience of respected experts. This means that the current quality of evidence supporting any recommendation on feline leishmaniosis is low (grade IV) [8] .

In this report the LeishVet group presents an overview on current knowledge on Leishmania infection in cats. Moreover, recommendations on the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring, prognosis and prevention of FeL are also described in order to standardize the management of this infection in cats. These were constructed by combining a comprehensive review of evidence-based studies and case reports, clinical experience and critical consensus discussions. The goal of this review is therefore to offer the veterinary practitioners an updated approach with recommendations on the management of leishmaniosis in cats.

Etiology and transmission 1. What species of Leishmania infect cats? What is their geographical distribution?

Five species within the genus Leishmania have been identified in cats: Leishmania mexicana, Leishmania venezuelensis, Leishmania braziliensis and Leishmania amazonensis in the New World, and Leishmania infantum in both the New and Old Worlds (Table 1) . We can therefore state that cats are likely to be infected by the same Leishmania species found in humans or other animals in the same geographic area.

Species, strains, isolates and genetic variants of Leishmania spp. found in cats have been characterized by means of laboratory procedures including electrophoresis of isoenzymes upon parasite cultivation, monoclonal antibodies and molecular methods. The latter mainly comprise conventional and real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with DNA sequence analysis, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) or hybridization of amplified products with specific probes (Table 1) .

In southern European countries, canine and human leishmaniosis are mainly caused by L. infantum zymodeme MON-1 [9] . This occurs also in FeL [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , but zymodemes MON-72 and MON-201 have also been isolated in two single cases from Sicily [10] .

There is no specific information on the transmission of Leishmania spp. to cats. However, due to the extensive data on vectorial transmission of the Leishmania group of protozoal parasites to vertebrates, there is no doubt that the essential mode of transmission is by bites of infectious phlebotomine sand flies as for other vertebrate species. This means that in areas where L. infantum is transmitted to dogs, cats are likely to be in contact with the parasite and can also be potentially infected. The sand fly vectors appear to be more permissive in their blood source preferences than thought before. Several studies have demonstrated that cats constitute sources of blood for sand flies [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Moreover, the experimental demonstration of infectiousness of two infected cats to sand flies [11, 20] indirectly proves the ability of the vector to properly complete feeding on cats and acquire infection.

To date, other routes of transmission including vertical or horizontal pathways have not been described or demonstrated in cats as they have been in dogs, mice or humans [1] .

3. What is the prevalence of L. infantum infection in endemic regions?

The prevalence of L. infantum infection in cat populations is commonly estimated by detection of specific antibodies, and DNA amplification by PCR [21] . Over the last few decades, many studies have confirmed that feline Leishmania infection may be relatively common in areas where CanL is endemic. Seroprevalence ranges from 0 to 68.5 % and molecular rates of infection range from 0 and 60.7 % in endemic regions of the Old World (Table 2) . Therefore, a high variability in antibody or molecular prevalences is evident from published investigations, and this may be due to different levels of endemicity, characteristics of the population under study or differences in diagnostic methodologies including the cut-off titres of serology. Moreover, few studies validated the serological techniques in cats by using feline positive control sera obtained from cats with clinical illness confirmed by isolation and negative control sera from a substantial number of cats from non endemic areas [22] [23] [24] [25] .

However, it is important to highlight that clinical illness and subclinical infection in cats are less frequently reported than in their canine counterparts. In fact, the seroprevalence of Leishmania infection in cats is lower than in dogs from the same locations [23, [26] [27] [28] and a lower PCR prevalence in cats than in dogs is also reported from similar geographical areas [29] . Immune responses leading to natural feline resistance might account for the observed differences in the prevalence of infection in cats as compared to dogs. Studies evaluating Leishmania specific cellular immunity tests in cats could better estimate infection, but they are still lacking in cats [22] .

Limited epidemiological studies have reported significant association between L. infantum infection diagnosed by serology or PCR and seasonality [24] , altitude [30] , rural habitat [23] , outdoor lifestyle [12] , male gender [23, 31, 32] and adult age [23, 24, 32, 33] . Feline L. infantum coinfections with feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline coronavirus (FCoV) and/or Toxoplasma gondii have been reported in the literature [24, 25, 31, [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] , but a significant association was found only between L. infantum positivity (molecular or serological) and FIV [25, 33, 35] .

Domestic dogs are considered the only known primary reservoir for L. infantum infection [38] . It has been considered for a long time that cats did not play any role in the epidemiology of L. infantum in endemic areas. This view was directed by the facts that, for a long period, very few cases of clinical leishmaniosis were described in cats as compared to dogs, and that Italy (Imperia, Liguria) PCR-RFLP [26] Italy (Messina, Sicily) MLEE [10] Italy (Lipari island, Sicily) MLEE and PCR-RFLP [11] Switzerland a PCR and sequencing [50] France (Alpes-Maritimes) MLEE [12] Spain (Barcelona) PCR and sequencing [29] Spain (Madrid community) PCR and sequencing [33, 78] Spain a ILMA [68] Spain (Mallorca) b PCR-RFLP [95] Portugal (Lisbon region) PCR and sequencing [96, 97] Portugal (Lisbon and Algarve regions) PCR and sequencing [98] Greece (Thessaly and Macedonia) PCR and sequencing [99] Brazil (Cotia, São Paulo state) PCR and sequencing [100] Brazil (Rio de Janeiro) PCR and hybridization [101] Brazil [23] cats have also been considered more resistant to experimental infection [39] . This interpretation has changed, as the concepts of reservoir and susceptibility in infected hosts are now better understood. The majority of infected dogs does not exhibit clinical signs (at least for a long period), although they can be infectious to sand flies and consequently serve as sources of infection. During the last two decades, many wild mammals have been diagnosed with Leishmania infection by serological and/or molecular methods [40] . However, their role as reliable sources of infection (infectiousness to sand flies, persistent infection) remains unknown [40] . The recent demonstration that hares can be persistently infected, infectious to sandflies and a reservoir for humans in the absence of participation of dogs in the transmission cycle opens a possible evaluation of the role of species other than dogs in the epidemiology of L. infantum infections in particular scenarios [41, 42] .

Surveys have shown that the percentage of infected cats is not negligible in some endemic areas (Table 2 ). In cats, disease and infection may persist for very long periods and cats have been shown to be infectious to sand flies in experimental xenodiagnosis studies both in the Old and New Worlds. They may, therefore, play some role in the transmission of L. infantum in regions where many cats are infected [43] .

In cats, infection could be promoted by concurrent immunosuppressive infections such as FIV or FeLV [13, 31] . The fact that cats appear to better control the infection and more rarely manifest the disease is also in favour of a potential persistent source role of infected individuals. Moreover, the population of pet and stray cats may be even larger than that of dogs in some endemic areas [44] .

According to the current state of the art, cats are most likely a secondary reservoir of L. infantum which will not support persisting infection in a natural setting if the primary reservoir is absent, e.g. cats alone would not be responsible for the persistence of L. infantum infection in an area where disease transmission is possible with abundant competent sand fly vectors, unless infected dogs are present. The epidemiological role of cats in the maintenance and transmission of L. infantum should nevertheless be further investigated [43] . Questions that need to be addressed include: 1) are cats involved in the transmission of parasite by sand fly vectors in endemic areas where both infected cats and dogs are present? 2) how attractive are cats to vector sandflies? 3) how accessible is the parasite in infected cats to sand flies?

Experimental Leishmania infection

Reports on experimental feline infections with Leishmania spp. are very scarce. Only two studies have been reported with different species of the Leishmania donovani complex and were both performed many years ago [39, 45] . This means that sensitive techniques such as PCR were not applied for monitoring infected cats. A third study was conducted more recently in Brazil with L. braziliensis [46] . Parasitological, serological and clinical details on the experimental studies carried out in cats are shown in Table 3 .

Based on these studies, cats are apparently less susceptible than dogs [47, 48] to the development of disease after established experimental infection with species of the L. donovani complex or are even resistant to infection [15] .

In contrast after experimental infection with L. braziliensis, domestic cats develop self-healing chronic cutaneous lesions containing parasites as often seen in dogs [49] .

6. What are the most common clinical findings of FeL due to L. infantum? Detailed case reports of FeL have been available in recent years mainly from European countries where pet cats typically have a higher standard of health care. In the New World, other Leishmania spp. are endemic and may co-infect cats and complicate the clinical picture [28] . Therefore, we have only reviewed case reports or case series originally from European countries. A total of 46 clinical cases have been published between 1989 and 2014, where the diagnosis of FeL was confirmed by serological and/or parasitological methods [11-14, 21, 26, 36, 37, 50-67] .

The most common clinical signs reported in FeL include skin or mucocutaneous lesions and lymph node enlargement, and they have been described in more than half of the cases (Table 4 ). Some cats showed only dermatological lesions alone [13, 52, 56, 58] , while others with skin lesions showed a combination with systemic signs [12, 14, 21, 26, 36, 51, 60, [62] [63] [64] 68] . Conversely, other cats did not have any skin detectable lesions on clinical presentation [11, 36, 50, 54, 55, 57, 66, 69, 70] .

The cutaneous and mucocutaneous lesions are described in Question 7. Lymphadenomegaly may be solitary or multicentric. Ocular lesions have been reported in approximately one third of the affected cats. Uveitis, either unilateral or bilateral (Fig. 1) , is the most common ocular lesion described, with occasionally a pseudotumoral granulomatous pattern and eventually progress to panophthalmitis [50, 53, 55, 64, 69] . Blepharitis and conjunctivitis have also been described in a number of clinical cases [66, 68, 70] . Amastigotes have been found by cytology in conjunctival nodules, corneal infiltrates and aqueous humor, and by histopathology after enucleation of the eye or post mortem even in uveal tissue [50, 53, 55, 64, 69] . Chronic gingivostomatitis is also a common clinical finding and has been found in about one fourth of the cats so far studied with leishmaniosis ( Fig. 2) [11, 26, 53, 55, 63, 66, 70] . Nodular lesions are unfrequently seen on the gingival mucosa or the tongue [60, 66, 69, 71] , where infected macrophages may be visualized in lesion biopses [60, 69] .

Non specific signs such as weight loss, reduced appetite, dehydration, and lethargy also have been reported. A list of other sporadic clinical manifestations described includes: pale mucous membranes, hepatomegaly, jaundice, cachexia, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, chronic nasal discharge, splenomegaly, polyuria/polydipsia, dyspnea, wheezing, abortion and hypothermia.

The implication of Leishmania as a cause of some of these clinical signs has been associated with the presence of the parasite in cytological or histopathological examinations of liver, spleen, lymph nodes, stomach, large bowel, kidney, oral mucosa, nasal exudate and eye tissues [13, 14, 36, 50, 57, 63, 66, 68, 72] . However, clinical disease is commonly associated with an impaired immunocompetence due to several causes including retroviral infections (FIV and FeLV), immunosuppressive treatment and concomitant debilitating diseases such as malignant neoplasia or diabetes mellitus [44] .

As also found in dogs, FeL does not exclude the possibility of concurrent diseases or co-infections. This fact may influence the clinical presentation and prognosis. The cause-effect relationship between various etiological and pathogenic factors is not always easy to establish [21] .

7. What are the most common dermatological findings of FeL due to L. infantum and to other Leishmania species?

Cutaneous lesions predominate in the clinical picture of FeL due to L. infantum. Dermal abnormalities include nodules, ulcerations or more rarely exfoliative dermatitis. They are generalized or localized, symmetrical or asymmetric and may, though less frequently, appear all over the body in a focal, multifocal, regional or diffuse pattern [12-14, 26, 36, 37, 51, 52, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 68, 70] . Some cats may harbour different types of skin lesions at the same time or develop them subsequently; they may coexist with mucocutaneous lesions (Fig. 3) . Cutaneous and mucocutaneous nodules, of variable size, are more often localized on the head, including eyelids, nose and lips, or on the distal parts of the limbs. Nodules have Ulcerations which may be diffuse and superficial or focal and deep (Fig. 4) are localized on the same body sites as nodules, and may be complicated by bacterial infections that explain why they are covered by hemorrhagic crusts and/or purulent material [13, 14, 52, 53, 56, 58, 60-62, 64, 65, 68, 70] . However, ulcerative dermatitis is sometimes diffuse and can be observed on the body trunk or on bony prominences [14, 36, 58, 62, 63] .

In contrast to CanL, exfoliative dermatitis (Fig. 5) is rare in the feline disease [36, 52, 68] . Other uncommon dermatologic presentations include hemorrhagic papules and nodules where Leishmania amastigotes can be found [37, 52] . Alopecia (Fig. 6) , which is also uncommon in FeL [12, 36, 52, 62, 64] , may be associated with other skin diseases concurring in L. infantum infected cats such as demodicosis [64] . Mild to severe pruritus is rare in FeL [58, 64, 65] and in some cases with a pruritic syndrome other compatible causes co-existed such as flea allergy [52] , pemphigus foliaceus (PF) [56] or neoplasia (squamous cell carcinoma) [14] . Skin histopathology of lesions associated with L. infantum has shown that the most commonly observed alteration is a granulomatous dermatitis [26, 51, 56, 59, 60, 68] .

It often has a diffuse pattern and the epidermis may present hyperkeratosis, acanthosis and ulceration [56, 68] . A nodular to diffuse arrangement of the granulomatous dermatitis is also reported [26, 60] . However, in a retrospective case series from Spain, two cats presented different histological findings [68] . The first one had granulomatous perifolliculitis with a high number of lymphocytes and plasma cells surrounding the cutaneous adnexa. It was associated with a marked hyperplasia of epidermis and sebaceous glands. The other cat was diagnosed with a lichenoid interface dermatitis typically represented by infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells and a few neutrophils and macrophages at the dermoepidermal junction. In this case, epidermal necrosis and epidermal microabscesses were also observed. A perivascular infiltration of superficial skin layers by macrophages, mast cells, neutrophils and eosinophils was also observed in another case [12] .

Leishmania amastigotes have always been identified in the affected skin. A semiquantitative estimation of amastigotes was also performed with the aid of immunohistochemistry (IHC) [68] , in which the parasitic load of the skin ranged from high (>50 immunolabelled amastigotes/field at x400) to moderate (10-50 immunolabelled amastigotes/field) in cases of diffuse granulomatous dermatitis [68] . Conversely, it was low (1-9 immunolabelled amastigotes/field) in cases of granulomatous perifolliculitis or lichenoid interface dermatitis [68] .

In biopsy samples taken from cases with ulcerative dermatitis, eosinophilic granulomatous dermatitis with a severe dermo-epidermal necrosis were found without the presence of amastigotes, but with a positive quantitative Leishmania PCR [62] .

In some FeL cases, other dermatological diseases such as eosinophilic granuloma and PF were also diagnosed [52, 56, 68] .

Interestingly, amastigotes were also found associated with neoplastic tissue in the lesion of two cats with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) [13] . In one other case, SCC was diagnosed in a cat presenting concurrent Leishmania skin lesions [14, 59] .

In two cases of skin disease caused by L. braziliensis, a mononuclear and neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate of the dermal tissue was seen in histological sections [77] . 9 . What are the most common differential diagnoses in L. infantum endemic areas for dermatological features?

The commonly seen cutaneous nodular form in FeL cases should be distinguished from nodules caused in cats with cryptococcosis, sporotrichosis, histoplasmosis, sterile or eosinophilic granuloma, mycobacterioses, and a wide variety of cutaneous neoplasms (e.g. feline sarcoids, mast cell tumor, fibrosarcoma, basal cell carcinoma, bowenoid in situ carcinoma and lymphoma). The main differentials of the ulcerative lesions include squamous cell carcinoma with which however it may co-exist [13, 14, 59] , idiopathic ulcerative dermatitis, indolent ulcer, mosquito-bite dermatitis, atypical mycobacteriosis and feline leprosy, cutaneous vasculitis, erythema multiforme and cold-agglutinin disease. Finally, skin diseases such as dermatophytosis, systemic or cutaneous lupus erythematosus, exfoliative dermatitis due to thymoma or due to immunemediated pathomecanisms, PF, sebaceous adenitis/mural Two years after a radical pinnectomy, the animal had lesion recurrence at the stump, and lesions later developed on the muzzle and nasal mucosa; treatment was attempted several times, but with no resolution USA (Texas) 8 domestic cats (5 males and 3 females) aged 1 to 11 years old (median: 3 years)

One or multiple nodules on the pinnae and less commonly on the muzzle and periorbital skin, with variably ulcerated, scaled or smooth surfaces (histology: numerous amastigotes) [76] Two cats had recurrent cutaneous leishmaniosis: one was treated with allopurinol, but the skin lesions continued to recur despite treatment; in three other cats, excisional biopsy was apparently curative, and lesions did not recur during the follow-up period (2-4 years)

L. venezuelensis Venezuela (Lara state) 4 cats One cat: nodular lesion (2 cm) on the nose and six smaller nodules on the ears; two cats: single nodules (2-3 cm) on the nose; one cat: single nodule on the nose (2-3 cm) and 3 months afterwards presented with metastatic new lesions on the ears, tail and lower limbs [105] folliculitis complex and paraneoplastic alopecia could be included in the differential list of those leishmanial cats that are admitted with the rare exfoliative/crusting dermatitis which may also be alopecic and erythematous. It has been postulated that PF and FeL may share a common pathomechanism (molecular mimicry) when they co-exist in the same cat [56] .

10. What clinicopathological findings may alert the clinician to the possibility of FeL due to L. infantum?

Limited information is available about clinicopathological abnormalities in cats and it is only based on case reports. Mild to severe normocytic normochromic non-regenerative anemia is the most frequent haematological abnormality reported in clinical cases [37] . Moderate to severe pancytopenia may be observed [37, 50, 57] in association with aplastic bone marrow, but some of the cats reported with pancytopenia were FIV positive [37, 50, 57] . Curiously, in one of these cases, amastigotes were found in 4 % of neutrophils in buffy coat smears [57] .

Hyperproteinemia with hypergammaglobulinemia is a common finding in FeL as also found in dogs [2] , and hypoalbuminemia is occasionally reported [37, 50] .

Renal proteinuria and increased serum creatinine are also reported at diagnosis or during follow-up in some cases [37, 68] .

Relative lymphocytosis and an increase in serum ALT activity were significantly associated with seroreactivity to L. infantum [78] .

The type of inflammatory infiltrate found in tissue cytology (aspirates, impression smears) or histopathology in organs such as skin, eye, oral mucosa, liver, spleen and kidney is commonly pyogranulomatous to granulomatous [66, 68, 72] . There was also lymphoid reactive hyperplasia in lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes [79] and spleen [57] , with variable numbers of Leishmania amastigotes observed (Fig. 7) .

11. What are the most common differential diagnoses in endemic areas for systemic illness caused by L. infantum in cats?

As lymph node enlargement is the most common sign, apart from skin and mucocutaneous lesions, FeL should be included in the differential list when this finding is noted on physical examination as solitary or generalized lymphadenomegaly. This list mainly includes infections with other infectious agents (FIV, FeLV, FCoV, Bartonella, Mycobacteria, T. gondii, Cryptococcus or other systemic mycoses), lymphoma or metastatic involvement from other neoplasia.

FeL should also be considered in cats with ophthalmologic disease, mainly in cats with acute, recurring or chronic uveitis and differentiated from similar clinical conditions caused by FIV, FeLV, FCoV, Bartonella, T. gondii, fungal infections, neoplasia or paraneoplastic syndrome. Some feline uveitis cases are considered idiopatic and treated with corticosteroids. A diagnosis of idiopatic uveitis was initially made in some cases of ocular FeL and corticosteroids worsened the disease [50, 55, 69] . This fact warrants a careful investigation Fig. 7 Fine-needle aspirate of a reactive lymph node from a cat with feline leishmaniosis due to Leishmania infantum: lymphoid hyperplasia and a macrophage with L. infantum amastigotes (red arrows). May-Grünwald-Giemsa stain, scale bar = 20 μm to exclude FeL before treating ocular disease with corticosteroids.

Proliferative and ulcerative chronic inflammation of the oral mucosa associated with FeL can be included in the list of possible causes of the feline chronic gingivostomatitis syndrome (FCGS). This painful and common immune-mediated disease is considered multifactorial in cats and treated by full mouth teeth extraction for eliminating oral plaque antigenic stimulation. Corticosteroids are frequently used to improve the clinical signs; however, when this was tried in some cats with oral disease associated with L. infantum infection it induced worsening of FeL [11, 66] .

Hyperglobulinemia with increased gammaglobulin level reported in FeL is usually found in chronic infections caused by viruses, bacteria or systemic fungi, or inflammation associated with FCGS or inflammatory bowel disease, or in neoplasia such as lymphoma, or multiple myeloma.

Most diagnostic techniques for Leishmania infection which are available for dogs are also employed in cats. Diagnosis is made in the majority of cases by serologic, cytologic, histologic, culture or PCR methods ( Table 6) .

The most common serological test used appears to be the immunoflurescence antibody test (IFAT). A validated cut off value of 1:80 has been recommended in cats tested by this serological technique and the serum antibody level to Leishmania antigen ranged from low to high positive levels in clinical cases of FeL [24] . Quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are also frequently employed and seems to be more sensitive than IFAT [80] [81] [82] . The direct agglutination test (DAT) was found less sensitive than IFAT [27] or ELISA [23] and western blot (WB) was more sensitive than IFAT [83] .

Clinical cases of FeL with positive sera have specific antibodies against L. infantum antigens of low molecular mass (≤31 kDa) [12, 22] by WB. These low molecular mass antigens are considered to be also the most specific polypeptides in the diagnosis of human [84, 85] and CanL [86, 87] . It is important to highlight that cats from both endemic and non endemic areas may be positive against high molecular weight antigens. This is also observed in dogs and humans and it is considered as a cross-reaction probably due to the presence of antibodies to the heat shock protein 70 family [22] .

In general, anti-Leishmania antibodies should always be evaluated by laboratories using serological methods validated in cats.

Cross-reactions exist between feline antibodies to different Leishmania and Trypanosoma species as also shown in dogs, but they do not seem to occur with antibodies to T. gondii [28, 66] .

Amastigotes were found in blood smears and smears from nasal exudate or corneal cytology [50, 57, 63, 66] .

The diagnostic procedure in cats positive to Leishmania infection should always be completed with Leishmania infantum can infect apparently healthy cats, and as with dogs, infection may persist with no clinical manifestations [88] . Since cats infected with L. infantum may not be sick and, therefore, not present any clinical signs, it is questionable whether healthy cats should be tested for this infection. In our opinion, cats with no clinical signs and/or clinicopathological abnormalities compatible with leishmaniosis should be tested for Leishmania infection if they are used as blood donors, since it has been shown for humans and dogs that blood products from infected individuals may transmit infection [89] . Antibody testing and blood PCR are advisable as indicated for dogs. Furthermore, testing can be done for exportation purposes to countries where leishmaniosis is not endemic and may require cats to be tested for infection before importation. Finally, cats with clinical conditions requiring immunosuppressive therapies should be preliminarily tested in endemic areas, as clinical cases of FeL were diagnosed in cats under long term immunosuppressive treatment.

14. What is the most effective specific treatment and the expected clinical response to treatment of FeL due to L. infantum?

The published information on the treatment of FeL is extremely limited because it is available from only 20 case reports and only some of them were followed up (Table 7) . Allopurinol is the most frequently used drug followed by meglumine antimoniate, but information is lacking on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of these drugs in cats and also about their safety.

Allopurinol is generally well tolerated; however, in one cat, elevation of hepatic enzymes was reported at 10 mg/kg BID and the dose was reduced to 5 mg/kg BID [56] . Clinical improvement was observed in most cases treated with allopurinoleven in FIV positive cats -within a few weeks after treatment was initated [37, 50, 64] or slowly after 6 months [56] . A long term follow-up was available in some cats treated with allopurinol. A clinical cure was obtained in these cats but relapse occurred after discontinuation of treatment, suggesting that they were still infected [14, 37, 55] . Clinical worsening leading to euthanasia occurred in a few cases after a few weeks of therapy [54, 57] .

Clinical cure was generally obtained in the few cats that were treated with meglumine antimoniate, but long term follow up are not available from these cases.

Some other oral drugs (fluconazole, itraconazole, metronidazole and spiramycin) administered to one cat at different times were considered as not effective [37] .

Surgical removal of cutaneous nodules (performed in two cats) was followed by relapsing of cutaneous lesions [36, 51] .

In conclusion, currently, no scientific evidence concerning the best treatment for FeL is available, but more extensive clinical experience is available for treatment with allopurinol (10 mg/kg BID or 20 mg/ kg SID). The drug of choice to be used in FeL should nevertheless be based on the best compliance and safety for the cat with the alternatives of long term oral drug treatment (allopurinol) or a parenteral therapy (meglumine antimoniate). As there are no studies on the safety of these drugs in cats, it is recommended to strictly monitor the health status of animals under treatment by means of regular check- SC: subcutaneous; IM: intamuscular; PO: per os a a same cat was treated with the three different therapeutic regimens at subsequent times ups including urinalysis, and advising the owner to promptly report any abnormality.

The duration of allopurinol treatment should be evaluated case by case based on clinical response and on parasitological and serological monitoring.

Some consideration can be extrapolated from information reported on 14 cats affected by FeL and followed up until death or euthanasia. On the basis of these reported cases, prognosis appears to vary from good to poor. In fact, five cats died a few days or weeks after diagnosis [12, 26, 36, 37, 65] . Some were affected by chronic renal failure or hepatic disease, but the real influence of Leishmania infection on mortality was not clearly demonstrated in these cases [36, 37, 65] . In other cases, euthanasia was performed after diagnosis because of a rapid clinical worsening [54, 57, 62] or due to a concurrent neoplasia [13] . Post mortem evaluation was obtained in three cats that died or were euthanized shortly after diagnosis, and all of them had visceral dissemination of Leishmania amastigotes found in the spleen, lymph nodes, liver, stomach or in the large bowel [13, 36, 57] .

Records of a long-term follow up (13-60 months) are available for nine cats and in four of the cases they were followed up until death or euthanasia [11, 37, 50, 56, 60, 66, 69, 70] . Their age ranged between 5 and 12 years at diagnosis and only one had been found positive for FIV antibodies. Clinical presentation varied but visceral dissemination of Leishmania infection was investigated and confirmed in all but one case. This latter cat had a diagnosis of PF associated with Leishmania infection confirmed by serology and PCR on skin biopsies, but the potential extra-cutaneous dissemination of infection was not investigated [56] . Four of these followed up cats were treated with allopurinol for 24-40 months [37, 50, 56, 66] .

It is noteworthy that three cats which were never treated with anti-Leishmania drugs after diagnosis died or were euthanized 1-5 years later and one was reported alive after 4 years. In these untreated cases, FeL progressed with time and chronic renal disease developed in two cats that were not treated. Untreated ocular FeL may cause vision loss and may require ocular enucleation due to panophthalmitis [50, 53, 55, 68, 69] .

The retrospective evaluation of single case reports did not provide clear evidence about the prognosis of FeL because the clinical data available are heterogeneous and sometimes incomplete; however, some conclusions can be inferred. Both treated and untreated cats may live for years before the deterioration of their health status mainly due to renal and heart injuries that might be unrelated to L.infantum infection. The exact role of L. infantum infection in the development of multiorgan injury causing renal, cardiac or hepatic disease has to be confirmed. However, it can significantly influence life expectancy and any concurrent diseases should be treated if detected. In case of renal disease, the International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) staging system is recommended for therapy, follow-up and prognosis (http:// www.iris-kidney.com).

There are two main reasons for employing preventive measures against L. infantum infection in a susceptible animal host and suspected reservoir such as the cat: 1) to protect the single animal from the risk of developing a clinical disease; 2) and to contribute to the reduction of the prevalence of infection in a geographic area. However, it should be also pointed out that the epidemiological role of the cat as a main reservoir for Leishmania species has not been confirmed [34] .

Due to the absence of studies on vaccines against Leishmania in cats, the best strategy to prevent Leishmania infection in this animal could be to use topical insecticides with application of chemical compounds with sand fly repellent activity, similar to those used for dogs. Unfortunately, most pyrethroids, like permethrin and deltamethrin, cannot be used in cats due to their toxicity to this species. The recent launch of a collar containing an additional compound belonging to this chemical class, flumethrin, that is well tolerated in the cat might represent a valid preventive option for the individual reduction of risk for infection of cats in highly endemic areas of leishmaniosis, and for limiting the infectiousness of those that are already infected. In fact, this collar was found useful in reduction of the incidence of L. infantum infection in dogs [90, 91] .

Although the data on FeL supported by consolidated evidence-based studies are limited, these guidelines constitute a baseline for educating and informing feline practitioners with the most comprehensive and updated data set on this important neglected feline protozoal disease.

Further studies need to elucidate gaps in knowledge on this infection in cats and to provide evidence-based information on the management of this disease.

molecules Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Activities of Essential Oils: A Short Review

Essential oils are complex mixtures isolated from aromatic plants which may possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of interest in thye food and cosmetic industries as well as in the human health field. In this work, a review was done on the most recent publications concerning their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. At the same time a survey of the methods generally used for the evaluation of antioxidant activity and some of the mechanisms involved in the anti-inflammatory activities of essential oils are also reported.

An essential oil is defined internationally as the product obtained by hydrodistillation, steam distillation or dry distillation or by a suitable mechanical process without heating (for Citrus fruits) of a plant or some parts of it [1] . They are aromatic oily liquids, volatile, characterized by a strong odour, rarely coloured, and generally with a lower density than that of water. They can be synthesized by all plant organs (flowers, buds, seeds, leaves, twigs, bark, herbs, wood, fruits and root) and therefore extracted from these parts, where they are stored in secretory cells, cavities, canals, epidermic cells or glandular trichomes [2, 3] . Essential oils only represent a small fraction of plant's composition; nevertheless they confer the characteristics by which aromatic plants are used in the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries [4] .

The proportions of the components present in essential oils vary greatly. Major components can constitute up to 85% of the essential oils, while the remaining components can be present in only trace OPEN ACCESS communication between plants [3, 13] . The detection of some of these biological properties needed for the survival of plants has also been the base for searching similar properties for the combat of several microorganisms responsible for some infectious diseases in humans and animals. This search intends to respond to the increasing resistance of pathogenic microbes to antibiotics. Reichling et al. (2009) [14] have compiled the most important results about antibacterial and antiviral properties of essential oils published in the last decade. In this review, the essential oils against bacteria from the respiratory tract, anti-Helicobacter pylori, anti-Mycoplasma pneumoniae; essential oils against DNA virus: HSV1 (herpes simplex virus), HSV-2, NDV (Newcastle disease); or RNA virus: SARS-Cov (severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus), and Junin virus were overviewed. In addition, essential oils have also revealed to be effective on the inhibition of growth and reduction in numbers of the more serious foodborne pathogens such as Salmonella spp., E. coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes [2] .

The antioxidant activity of essential oils is another biological property of great interest because they may preserve foods from the toxic effects of oxidants [15] . Moreover, essential oils being also able of scavenging free radicals may play an important role in some disease prevention such as brain dysfunction, cancer, heart disease and immune system decline. Increasing evidence has suggested that these diseases may result from cellular damage caused by free radicals [16, 17] .

If essential oils are able to scavenge some free radicals, they can also act as anti-inflammatory agents, because one of the inflammatory responses is the oxidative burst that occurs in diverse cells (monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and macrophages). Phagocytosis of bacteria, which occurs during inflammation, is accompanied by a dramatic increase in oxygen consumption resulting in the formation of superoxide anion radical (O 2

) which is quickly converted to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), spontaneously, or by the enzyme superoxide dismutase. Hydrogen peroxide can then also be reduced by transition metal ions generating the hydroxyl radical (HO • ), one of the strongest oxidizing agents that can rapidly react with polyunsaturated fatty acids, resulting the production of peroxyl radicals (ROO • ). Peroxide hydrogen can also oxidise halide ions (Cl -) to hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which is a strong oxidant that can react with amines producing chloramines, some of them being very toxic [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . These radicals are commonly known as ROS (reactive oxygen species). Nevertheless and during an inflammatory process, there is also the generation of other free radicals named RNS (reactive nitrogen species). Nitric oxide ( • NO) and peroxynitrite anion (ONOO -) are two examples of this sort of radicals. Nitric oxide is produced in large quantities by the inducible nitric oxide synthases (iNOS) in activated macrophages and neutrophils during defence and immunological reactions. However this reactive species can also exerts its toxicity by generating the peroxynitrite anion after reacting with the superoxide anion radical [22, [23] [24] [25] .

Peroxynitrite is formed by phagocytes for killing invading microorganisms, nevertheless if in high concentrations can oxidise several host biomolecules by nitration with the consequent cellular damages being responsible for diverse diseases [26] .

ROS and RNS are generated in phagocytes in order to neutralise the invading organisms, having therefore an important role in the host defence mechanism. Nevertheless, their overproduction may be responsible for damage at inflammatory sites. In addition these reactive species play important roles in inflammation by being trigger elements or by being signalling messenger molecules. ROS and RNS act as modulators of protein and lipid kinases and phosphatases, membrane receptors, ion channels, and transcription factors, including nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), which regulate the expression of key cytokines [22] . This short review reports the potential of essential oils as antioxidants and antiinflammatory agents, as well as the in vitro mechanisms involved in such properties.

Antioxidants may act as physical barriers to prevent ROS generation or ROS access to important biological sites (UV filters, cell membranes); chemical traps/sinks that "absorb" energy and electrons, quenching ROS (carotenoids, anthocyanidins); catalytic systems that neutralize or divert ROS [antioxidant enzymes SOD (superoxide dismutase), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase]; binding/inactivation of metal ions to prevent generation of ROS (ferritin, ceruloplasmin, catechins); and chain-breaking antioxidants which scavenge and destroy ROS (ascorbic acid, tocopherols, uric acid, glutathione, flavonoids) [27] . Therefore, and based on their mode of action, the antioxidants can be classified as primary, secondary or co-antioxidants. Primary antioxidants are able to donate a hydrogen atom rapidly to a lipid radical, forming a new radical, which is more stable. Secondary antioxidants react with the initiating radicals (or inhibit the initiating enzymes), or reduce the oxygen level (without generating reactive radical species). Therefore, these secondary antioxidants can retard the rate of radical initiation reaction by elimination of initiators. This can be performed by deactivating high energy species (singlet oxygen); absorbing UV light; scavenging of oxygen; chelating metal that catalyses free radical reaction, or inhibiting enzymes, such as peroxidases, NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase, among other oxidative enzymes [28] .

Direct and indirect methods have been applied to determine the chain-breaking antioxidant activity of natural products. Direct methods are based on studying the effect of a tested product (e.g. food) containing antioxidants on the oxidative degradation of a testing system. The substrate of oxidation may be individual lipids, lipid mixtures (oils), proteins, DNA, blood plasma, LDL, and biological membranes. Homogenous lipids or microheterogeneous systems (micelles and liposomes) can be used depending on the solubility of samples. The indirect method studies the ability of antioxidant to scavenge some free radicals, which is not associated with the real oxidative degradation [29] .

In direct methods, they can be based on the kinetic of lipid peroxidation or on the kinetic of nonchain process (direct competition methods). In the first case, two modes of lipid peroxidation can be used for testing the antioxidant activity: one of them is the autoxidation mode when the process is progressing spontaneously, with self-acceleration due to the accumulation of LOOH; the other mode is based on the use of the kinetic model of the controlled chain reaction. The utilization of thermo-labile azo-compounds [water-soluble 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) and lipidsoluble 2,2'-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) (AMVN)] that decompose and produce active free radicals at moderate temperatures at any desired rate, which can be easily altered and controlled are two good examples greatly used [29] . When these thermo-labile azo-compounds are not used, and for accelerating lipid oxidation, increased partial oxygen pressure and temperature; addition of transition metal catalysts; exposure to light; and variable shaking and free radical sources may be used [5] .

There are two very popular methods for monitoring lipid peroxidation: determination of conjugated dienes (absorbance at 234 nm) and the TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) assay. This method measures the malonaldehyde formed after lipid hydroperoxide decomposition, which forms a pink chromophore with thiobarbituric acid (TBA). However, TBARS is representative of a rather late stage of lipid oxidation, when the oxidation substrate has undergone substantial transformation [29] . There are other methods, including the determination of peroxide value, iodine value, chromatographic measurement of volatile compounds, formic acid measurement [the Rancimat method in an automated test that measures the conductivity of low molecular weight fatty acids (formic acid) produced during the auto-oxidation of lipids at 100 ºC or above] [5] .

In the direct competition methods, natural antioxidants compete for the peroxyl radical with a reference free radical scavenger. Examples of reference free radicals scavengers include the fluorescent natural protein R-phycoerithrin and the natural crocin, or fluorescein, which compete with the antioxidant sample for peroxyl radicals formed. These radicals may be produced through the addition of AAPH or AMVA. This is the principle of the so-called ORAC (oxygen radical absorbance capacity) protocol. Another example is the bleaching of β-carotene during the autoxidation of linoleic acid or in a controlled chain reaction by using a free radical initiator: AAPH [29] .

Examples of free radicals which is not associated with the real oxidative degradation (indirect method) are 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) or 2,2-diphenyl-1picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), both with different colour according to the redox status. Another example of indirect method is based on the reduction of Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ , in the presence of 2,4,6-trypyridyl-s-triazine. This method is known as FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power). There are also methods based on the chemiluminescence of luminal in the presence of free radicals, which can be produced through AAPH [29] .

In addition to the methods to determine the chain-breaking antioxidant activity, there are also the remaining methods for evaluating the capacity for scavenging other free radicals such as superoxide, hydroxyl, nitric oxide, peroxynitrite or for chelating metals (secondary antioxidants). Many methods have been developed and compiled in recent review articles, being also in some of them reported the advantages and disadvantages of those methods [27, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . The antioxidant ability of the essential oils has also been evaluated using several methods. A recent review discusses the diversity of tests used by different authors for evaluating the antioxidant activity of essential oils [5] .

Lipid oxidation is a complex reaction that can be generated via three different pathways: 1. Nonenzymatic free radical-mediated chain reactions; 2. Non-enzymatic, non-radical photo-oxidations; 3. Enzymatic reactions [5] .

The first pathway leads to initiation of rapidly progressing, destructive chain reactions, generating hydroperoxides and volatile compounds, generally through a three-phase process: initiation, propagation and termination.

The initiation phase involves homolytic breakdown of hydrogen in the α-position relative to the fatty acid chain double bond, leading to the formation of an allyl radical. These species are highly unstable, short-lived intermediates that stabilize themselves by abstracting hydrogen from another chemical species or rapidly react with oxygen to form a peroxyl radical (propagation phase). In the propagation phase, peroxyl radicals formed can further oxidise the lipid, producing hydroperoxides.

These are stabilised via double-bond rearrangement (electron deslocalization), originating conjugated dienes and trienes. These intermediates decompose, originating alcohols, aldehydes, alkyl formates, ketones, hydrocarbons, alkoxyl radicals and formic acid. All of these compounds are considered secondary products of lipid oxidation [5] .

In assessing lipid peroxidation, several lipid substrates can be used. i.e. oils and fats, linoleic acid, fatty acid methyl esters and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). The antioxidant activity in such systems can be detected by measuring the substrate and the oxidant consumption, and the intermediates or the final products formation [5] .

Several tests are available for determining the primary and secondary products of lipid oxidation. From the most recent works published in scientific journals about the antioxidant activity of essential oils, it is possible to register such diversity on the evaluation of the antixodant activity of essential oils.

3.1.1. Peroxidation level evaluation using the ferric thiocyanate During linoleic acid oxidation, peroxides are formed (primary products of oxidation), which oxidise Fe 2+ to Fe 3+ . The latter ions form a complex with thiocyanate, and this complex has a maximum absorbance at 500 nm. Therefore, high absorbance indicates high linoleic-acid oxidation. Using this method, some authors [42] found that Lavandula angustifolia Mill. oil from Australia was significantly more effective against lipid peroxidation than any of the other oils studied. Such oil was predominantly constituted by linalool and lynalyl acetate.

The antioxidant effect of test substances can be evaluated by monitoring the conjugated diene formation at the early stage of lipid peroxidation. The hydroperoxides formed from methyl linoleate by oxidation at 40 ºC was measured by [43] over time, spectrophotometrically, at a wavelength of 234 nm (for conjugated diene absorption). The oils of Thymus vulgaris L. (thyme), [Eugenia caryophyllus (C. Spreng) Bull et Hare] (clove), and Ocimum basilicum L. (basil) had appreciable antioxidant activities, comparable to that of α-tocopherol, the reference chosen by the authors [43] . In the thyme oil p-cymene and thymol predominated; in the clove oil, eugenol and β-caryophyllene dominated; and in basil oil, linalool, isoanethole and eugenol constituted the major components. All of these components present in different relative percentages in the oils had similar ability for preventing lipidic peroxidation.

The β-carotene bleaching method (coupled oxidation of β-carotene and linoleic acid) estimates the relative ability of antioxidant compounds in plant extracts to scavenge the radical of linoleic acid peroxide that oxidizes β-carotene in the emulsion phase. β-carotene in the absence of the antixodant undergoes a rapid decolourization since the free linoleic acid radical attacks the β-carotene, which loses the double bonds and, consequently, its orange colour.

From the seven Himalayan Lauraceae species, the essential oils of Dodecadenia grandiflora Nees, Lindera pulcherrima (Nees) Benth. ex Hook. f. and Persea gamblei (King ex Hook. f.) Kosterm were able to inhibit linoleic acid oxidation. Sesquiterpenoids dominated the oils. Furanodiene and germacrene D predominated in the oils of Dodecadenia grandiflora, whereas furanodienone and curzerenone constituted the major components of the Lindera pulcherrima oil [44] . The oils of Persea gamblei were constituted by β-caryophyllene, γ-gurjunene and β-cubenene. Such activities were independent on the presence of phenolic compounds in the essential oils. Mighri et al. (2010) [45] studied the antioxidant activity of the essential oils of Artemisia herbaalba Asso. cultivated in Southern Tunisia. Diverse methods were used, and one of them was the βbleaching test. They found four oil types: β-thujone, α-thujone, thujones (α + β), and 1,8cineole/camphor/thujones (α + β). All of these oils exhibited weak antioxidant abilities for preventing the linoleic acid oxidation. The β-thujone-rich oil showed the best inhibition percentage (12.5%), nevertheless much lower than BHA (89.2%). The attributed such results to the absence of nonphenolic compounds [45] .

The essential oils of different parts of Myrtus communis var. italica L. leaf, stem and flower were chemically evaluated. α-Pinene and 1,8-cineole dominated the leaf oil; 1,8-cineole, α-pinene, transcaryophyllene and linalool constituted the major components of the stem oil, whereas in the flower oil, along with these 4 components, there was also α-terpineol and eugenol. Leaf and flower oils had the best antixidant activities, nevertheless inferior to those of BHT and BHA. The authors [46] attributed such weak activities to the low level of phenolic compounds (eugenol in the flowers) or even their absence (stem and leaf), because the extracts also studied in the present work presented higher activities. Nevertheless it is worthy to refer the similar activities found in leaf and flower oils, in spite of the absence or phenols in leaf oils.

The antioxidant activity of Hymenocrater longiflorus Benth. from Iran was evaluated [47] . The main components of the oils included α-pinene, 1,8-cineole, β-eudesmol, spathulenol, hedycaryol, δ-cadinene, among other components, nevertheless predominating the oxygenated sesquiterpenids (47.4%). The essential oils were able to inhibit the bleaching of β-carotene. The precentage of inhibition was even close (66.4%) to those found for the non-polar-sub-fraction (chloroformic) (69.1%), which presented the best activity. However, the authors did not explain these results which are contradictory to those obtained when the antioxidant activity was measured through other method, in which the polar fraction rich in phenolic compouds had the greatest activity [47] .

The antioxidant activities of other oils isolated from diverse Iranian plants were also assayed [48, 49] . In both cases the activities were weak. The percentage inhibition of Salvia eremophila Boiss. oil was of about one third of that of BHT, in contrast to the methanolic extracts of the same plant, which presented activities comparable to that of BHT. The authors considered the absence of phenolic compounds in the oils responsible for such weak activity. α-Pinene, borneol, camphene and transcaryophyllene were the main components of the oil [48] . For the Psammogeton canescens (DC.) vatke oil the authors [49] also attributed the weak activity of the oils to the presence of β-bisabolene, apiole, α-pinene and dill apiole, all non-phenolic compounds.

The antioxidant, antimicrobial and antispasmodic activities of Origanum acutidens (Hand.-Mazz) Ietswaart from the Turkish flora were evaluated [50] . Carvacrol was the major component of the essential oil. This oil presented antioxidant activity, but inferior to that of the reference substance used by the authors (BHT). In spite of the high percentage of carvacrol present in the oil, the inhibition percentage only reached 65%, in contrast to the 100% of BHT.

This method measures the malondialdehyde (MDA) formed after lipid hydroperoxide decomposition (secondary products of oxidation), which forms a pink chromophore with thiobarbituric acid (TBA). This coloured complex, which absorbs at 532 nm, results in the condensation of TBA and malondialdehyde in an acidic environment. This method is not very specific, because 4-hydroxyalkenals, 2,4-alkadienals and 2-alkenals, protein and sugar degradation products, amino acids, nucleic acids and anthocyanins are also able to react with TBA, forming a chromophore [5] .

The essential oil of Ageratum conyzoides L., mainly constituted by precocene I and caryophyllene, possessed good capacity for preventing lipid peroxidation, using as lipid substrate liver homogenate [51] . The results were even better than those found for the reference BHA. The authors have also tested methanolic extracts of the same plants but the activities were about 100 times lower than those of the essential oils. The authors also hypothesise that the antiaflatoxigenic activity found for the essential oils may be partly due to their antioxidant activity [51] .

Antioxidant activity of essential oils of five spice plants used in the Mediterranean diet was evaluated [52] through the thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) test using egg yolk as substrate. All essential oils tested (Thymus vulgaris L., [Eugenia caryophyllus (C. Spreng) Bull et Hare], Origanum vulgare L., Salvia officinalis L. and Rosmarinus officinalis L.) had antioxidant activity, but Thymus vulgaris oil presented the best activity, close to that verified for BHT. Terpinen-4ol, γ-terpinene, cis-sabinene hydrate, linalool and p-cymene predominated.

The antioxidant activity of Thymus essential oils from Portugal were the target of study in [53] . The authors studied the capacity of preventing lipid peroxidation through the same method described by [52] and they found that Thymus zygis subsp. zygis and Thymus zygis subsp. sylvestris oils obtained from different regions of Portugal showed good antioxidant activities, even better than that of BHT. Carvacrol, thymol, p-cymene and γ-terpinene predominated in the oils, although in different percentages.

Thymus marschallianus Will. and Thymus proximus Serg. oils from China had lower capacity for preventing lecithin peroxidation than BHT, using TBARS method. Nevertheless, between the oils, that isolated from Thymus proximus had much higher activity. p-Cymene, γ-terpinene and thymol predominated in this ois, whereas in the other oil, only γ-terpinene and thymol dominated. According to these results, the authors [54] stressed the importance of p-cymene in the antioxidant activity of Thymus proximus, besides thymol and γ-terpinene.

Among seven Himalayan Lauraceae species, only the essential oils of Dodecadenia grandiflora and Lindera pulcherrima were able to inhibit lipid peroxidation, using liver homogenate as lipidic substrate. These oils, along with Persea gamblei, were already reported as being potent inhibitors of linoleic oxidation measured through the β-carotene bleaching test [44] . Such activities were independent of the presence of phenolic compounds in the essential oils.

The evaluation of the antioxidant activities of essential oils from Capparis spinosa L. and Crithmum maritimum L. from Dalmatia (Croatia) by different methods, showed that using TBARS method, the oils presented at 1 g/L (the highest concentration tested) lower ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation than BHA, but close to that of BHT. They also found that the activity was dosedependent. The differences of activity of both samples was not significant, although the differences in the chemical composition of the oils were. Capparis spinosa oil was predominantly constituted by methyl isothiocyanate, whereas sabinene and limonene were the main components of Crithmum maritimum oil [55] .

Amomum tsao-ko Crevost & Lemairé is a zingiberaceous plant called 'Caoguo' or 'Tsao-ko', which is widely distributed in the south-west of China. As some reports have related cytotoxicity with antioxidant activity and the essential oil studied by the authors had substantial anticancer activity, [56] assayed the antioxidant activity of their samples using diverse methods, being one of them the TBARS method. The lipidic substrate was constituted by liposomes containing lecithin, and the induction of peroxidation was performed with ferrous sulphate. They found weak antioxidant activity, as expected by the authors, due to the low phenolic content of the oils. The main component was 1,8-cineole. The absence of phenolic compounds related with weak antioxidant activity is not in accordance with those reported by [44, 55] , which found potent and moderate activity with oils presenting furanodiene, germacrene D, furanodienone, curzerenone, and sabinene and limonene, respectively. In spite of the different composition of the oils it is also important to stress that this difference of activities may also be attributed to the different lipidic substrate used in both works.

Aerial parts and seeds of Foeniculum vulgare Mill. oils possess different chemical compositions, nevertheless in what concerns the antioxidant activity, the authors in [57] found that for higher concentrations of essential oils (>750 mg/L for the aerial parts and > 1,000 mg/L for seeds) a decrease of the activity was observed, suggesting that high concentrations of essential oils possess a pro-oxidant activity, independent of their richness in trans-anethole (aerial parts) or methyl chavicol (seeds).

Suanarunsawat et al. (2010) [58] have investigated the anti-hyperlipidemic and antioxidant activities of essential oils extracted from Ocimum sanctum L. leaves in rats fed with high cholesterol diet. Eugenol and methyl eugenol were the most important components in the essential oils. The oils were able to decrease the high levels of TBARS either in cardiac or liver tissues, protecting them against stress induced oxidation.

Malonaldehyde can also be measured through gas chromatography with a nitrogen phosphorous detector, after derivatization of malonaldehyde to 1-methylpyrazole with N-methylhydrazine. This method was followed by [43] that demonstrated the oils of Thymus vulgaris and Eugenia caryophyllus possessed the strongest activity, even comparable to that of α-tocopherol. However, in the same work the authors also reported that at higher concentrations of thyme oil, such capacity decreased. Basil oil, that was considered a good antioxidant when the activity was measured through the conjugated diene assay, did not stand out in this test, in which was only considered as possessing moderate activity. Such results may reveal that basil is only able to prevent the primary oxidation of lipids.

This assay is convenient for evaluating the effects of antioxidants against slow oxidation phenomena occurring over prolonged periods of time, as shown in the shelf life of foods [59] . The authors [43] using this method showed that the oils of Thymus vulgaris, Eugenia caryophyllus, Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume., Ocimum basilicum L. and Illicium verum Hook. f. were able to prevent the oxidation of hexanal to hexanoic acid promoted by heat and pure air introduced in a sealed system, after 40 days of storage. The decrease of hexanal was followed by gas chromatography coupled to a flame ionisation detector. Such results may demonstrate the low importance of phenolic compounds to prevent hexanal oxidation, since Illicium verum oil was mainly cosnstituted by anethole [43] .

The Rancimat method is an automated test that measures the conductivity of low molecular weight fatty acids (formic acid) produced during the auto-oxidation of lipids at 100 ºC or above [5] . The antioxidant activity of essential oils of five spice plants used in the Mediterranean diet that was evaluated through the TBARS method [52] was also evaluated through the Rancimat method in which the lipid substrate was lard. The system was heated at 120 ºC and an air flow of 20 L/h was constantly blown into the mixture. The end of the induction period was characterized by the sudden increase of water conductivity, due to the dissociation of volatile carboxylic acids. Their results showed that the oils of Thymus vulgaris and Origanum vulgare L. showed the best antioxidant activity index, as determined by the Rancimat method, but less than the activity of BHT (synthetic standard). Carvacrol was the main component of the Origanum vulgare oil. In this case, an oil rich in phenolic components (oregano) and the other one (thyme) without great levels of these components presented similar activities, in contrast to that reported for the TBARS, in which thyme possessed the best activity [52] . This is a good example in which diverse methods of antioxidant evaluation may give rise different results, showing therefore the importance of using several methods to evaluate the enatioxidant activity of samples.

Supercritical fluid extraction of the volatile oil from Thymus vulgaris L. aerial parts and the correspondent composition was compared with those of the essential oil isolated by hydrodistillation. The main components in both cases were p-cymene, γ-terpinene, linalool, thymol and carvacrol. The percentages changed according to the method of extraction used, nevertheless p-cymene and thymol dominated in both cases. The great difference was found to be the presence of thymoquinone in the volatile oil obtained through the supercritical fluid extraction. The presence of this component could be the responsible for the highest antioxidant activity assessed by Rancimat test, in which the lipidic substrate was sunflower oil [60] .

It is also noteworthy to stress the difference in the chemical composition of Thymus vulgaris oils reported by [52, 60] , showing therefore the importance of the evaluation of the chemical composition of samples.

For measuring free radical scavenging ability, the methods are grouped in two groups, according to the chemical reactions involved: hydrogen atom transfer reaction-based methods and single electron transfer reaction-based methods [5] .

The most commonly used DPPH assay is simple and highly sensitive. DPPH is commercialised in the radical form due to its stability. This radical shows a strong absorption maximum at 517 nm (purple). In the presence of antioxidants, the colour turns from purple to yellow. Therefore the sole equipment needed for the assay is a UV-Vis spectrophotometer.

Initially, DPPH radical was thought to be reduced to the corresponding hydrazine when it reacted with the donating hydrogen substances. However, more recent studies have shown that what occurs is mainly a fast electron transfer from the sample to DPPH radical. The abstraction of hydrogen from the sample by DPPH radical is marginal, because it occurs very slowly and depends on the hydrogen-bond accepting solvent. Methanol and ethanol, solvents generally used for antioxidant ability assays, are strongly hydrogen bond-accepting, therefore the hydrogen-abstracting reaction occurs very slowly [5] .

Due to its simplicity and sensitivity, some authors only use DPPH method for evaluating the antioxidant activities of essential oils. Recently, in our bibliographic research, some examples could be found [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] . Sometimes, the decision of only using this method can be attributed to the low antioxidant activity detected, therefore the authors consided it unnecessary to pursue other methods. One example is the case reported in [61] , in which the authors found low antioxidant activities of Commiphora ornifolia (Balf. f.) Gillett and Commiphora parvifolia Engl. oils even at high concentrations. According to these results along with the chemical composition of the oils, in which phenolic compounds were absent, the authors probably considered it unnecessary to use other methods. Another example is the oil of leaves of Olea europaea L. cv. Chemlali from Tunisia that also possesses low activity when compared to BHT [70] , because the main components were α-pinene and 2,6-dimethyloctane, that is, non-phenolic compounds.

Nevertheless, there are other authors that consider it enough to test using only one method (DPPH) when good antioxidant activity values are found [62, [66] [67] [68] 70] . For example, the authors in [62] found high antioxidant activities of the essential oils of Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. growing wild in different localities of Sardinia (Italia). The activities changed according to the chemical composition, neverthless generally constituted by p-cymene, 1,8-cineole, β-phellandrene, spathulenol and cryptone in different proportions according to the harvesting place and period. The essential oil of Majorana hortensis L. had appreciable antioxidant activity probably ascrible to carvacrol with positive synergism with other components [66] . Citrus maxima Burm. and Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck also had considerable antioxidant activities, despite the chemical differences of their essential oils. Whereas Citrus sinensis oils was predominantly constituted by limonene, in Citrus maxima oil, several components could be identified in significant amounts in the oil (limonene, E-citral, Z-citral and 3,3dimethyl-1-hexene [67] . Heracleum pastinacifolium and Heracleum persicum were described as possessing moderate antioxidant activity, which main components were myristicin and trans-amethole, respectively [68] . Three Mexican Lippia graveolens Kunth. oils with different chemical compositions as well as their microcapsules were evaluated in terms of antiradical activities. The authors concluded that microencapsulation increased the anti-radical activity from fourfold to eightgold [69] . Diverse oils obtained from Origanum vulgare L. subsp. glandulosum (Desf.) collected at different locations of Tunisia showed different but always good abilities for scavenging DPPH radicals. Such results depended on the percentage of phenolic compounds (thymol) present in the oils [71] . In spite of the fact some authors consider that the flower oils of Retama raetam (Forssk.) Webb cultivated in Tunisia presented good antioxidant activity, as measured through the DPPH method, the sole method used by the authors, whereby the IC 50 value was fortyfold superior to that of the reference BHT, nevertheless the apparent relative good activity reported by the authors could be attributed to the relative high percentage of monoterpenes present in the essential oils [72] . A good activity was found by Saei-Dehkordi et al. (2010) [74] for the root oil of Ridolfia segetum (L.) Moris from Tunisia, because the IC 50 values were close to that of BHT. Such antiradical activity could be attributed to the high amounts of two phenyl-propanoids, dillapiole and myristicin [60] .

The DPPH method was also the sole one used by [63] , although the authors also performed the DPPH method but coupled to TLC (thin layer chromatography), that allows determination of which compounds are resposnsible for antioxidant activity. Using two tests based on the same principle but using diverse methodologies (spectrophotometer and TLC), the authors were able to find the compounds responsible for such activities after separation by TLC. The authors identified 1,8-cineole and methyl eugenol as the components responsible for the moderate antioxidant activity of the essential oils of Myrtus communis L.. The same procedure was followed by other authors [64] for the oils of Aniba panurensis (Meisn.) Mez, Aniba rosaeodora Ducke and Licaria martiniana (Mez) Kostern., from Brazil. The IC 50 values were generally >1,000 μg/mL, substantially superior to that of quercetin, the reference used by the authors. Such low activity was attributed to the absence or to the very low concentrations of some compounds responsible for antioxidant activity -β-caryophyllene along with phenolic compounds. Once again, and as reported above, such results might be enough for the authors to decide not to do other assays.

Saleh et al. (2010) [65] have conducted a comparative evaluation of the antioxidant properties of 248 essential oils by the spectrophotometer method of DPPH along with DPPH/TLC. Only 17 species possessed effective antioxidant activity, mainly belonging to the Lamiaceae family. The active compounds detected by DPPH/TLC method included phenols, non-phenols, oxygenated or non-oxygenated compounds.

In spite of the fact that some authors choose only one method for evauating the antioxidant activity, the great majority prefers to check at least two assays. The combinations may include assays for evaluating the ability for inhibiting lipidic peroxidation through the methods reported above and other ones not included in this text and tests regarding the ability for scavenging free radicals.

Some of the authors that had evaluated the ability of essential oils to prevent lipid peroxidation by the TBARS method, also had evaluated the capacity for scavenging free radicals, using the DPPH assay [44, 54, [51] [52] [53] 56, 57] .

Not always the best activity found in the TBARS assay also corresponds to the best ability to scavenge DPPH radicals. Such was found [44, 51] . The essential oils of Ageratum conyzoides or Amomum tsao ko presented better ability to prevent lipid peroxidation than for scavenging free radicals. Ageratum conyzoides methanolic extracts that had low capacity for preventing lipid oxidation, in the DPPH assay were revealed to be more effective than the essential oil [51] . On the other hand Lindera pulcherrima, Dodecadenia grandiflora and Dodecadenia gamblei presented the best inhibition of lipid peroxidation determined through the TBARS method as well as in the β-carotene bleaching test, but in the DPPH method, only Dodecadenia grandiflora was a powerful DPPH radical scavenger [44] . Another example was that reported [52] for Thymus vulgaris and Eugenia caryophyllus oils. In this assay, the authors found that the Thymus vulgaris oil had the best activity against lipid oxidation, whereas in the DPPH method, the authors found that Eugenia caryophyllus oil was the most potent scavenger of DPPH free radicals, even better than the standards ascorbic acid and BHT. The same authors also used the Rancimat test, and in that ase, the best oil was that of Origanum vulgare, although worse than that of the reference BHT. The non-polar fraction and essential oil of Hymenocrater longiflorus possessed great ability to inhibit the bleaching of β-carotene, nevertheless the results differed when the DPPH method was used. In this case, the essential oil was the only one that had the worst capacity for scavenging these free radicals [47] . Independent of the plant part of Myrtus communis var. italica L. used and the antioxidant method used, the methanolic fractions were always better antioxidants than the essential oils [46] . This is one example in which in both methods the results maintained in contrast to those reported until now.

As already reported above, there are researchers that prefer to evaluate the antioxidant activity of the essential oils through their ability to scavenge free radicals. There are several free radicals that can be used; nevertheless the fundamental principles involved may be the same. This method relies on the reduction of the blue-green cation radical of ABTS +• , by measuring the reduction of the radical cation as the percentage of inhibition of absorbance at 734 nm. The absorbance of the reaction mixture of ABTS and an antioxidant is compared to that of the Trolox ® standard, and the results are expressed in terms of Trolox ® equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) [59] .

As reported for the DPPH method, there are also some authors that only used the ABTS method for evaluating the antioxidant activity of essential oils [75, 76] . Ennajar et al. (2010) [75] studied the influence of organ, season and drying method on chemical composition and the ABTS-scavenging ability of Juniperus phoeniceae L.. They found the highest and the lowest activities in the same part of the plant (berries). Considering the drying method used, oven-drying was the best method to obtain an important activity for leaf and berry oils, followed by sun-dried essential oils and shade-dried samples. Such variability seemed to be related to the chemical composition of the oils, wich having a similar profile, the main components were present in different proportions (α-pinene, δ-3-carene, α-terpineol, β-myrcene, among other components). Rosa canina L. also possessed capacity for scavenging ABTS, nevertheless the harvesting place was determinant in such activity, which seemed to be related to the presence of high percentages of vitispirane [76] .

However and generally we find other tests being utilized along with ABTS for evaluating free radical-scavenging capacity. For example, Satureja intricata Lange had ability for scavenging both DPPH and ABTS, whereas Satureja obovata Lag. did not possess such ability [77] . This behaviour could be attributed to the presence of thymol and its precursors p-cymene and γ-terpinene, along with borneol in Satureja intricata. The essential oils of Artemisia herba-alba already reported above as possessing little ability for inhibiting lipid peroxidation [45] , when evaluated in terms of free radical scavenging, the oils continued to have weak activity. In this case and in contrast to other works [44, 51] , the essential oil of Artemisia herba-alba was not effective either against lipid oxidation nor as a free radical scavenger.

Lavander (Lavandula angustifolia) oil, as reported above, was the most effective against lipid peroxidation [42] . Concerning free radical-scavenging activity, lavender essential oil also exhibited the highest DPPH-scavenging activity, neverthelesss in the ABTS-scavenging activity, the best oils were those of Mentha x piperita L and Boswellia carteri Birdw. In the DPPH method, limonene had similar activity of that of Lavandula angustifolia, although linalool and linalyl acetate constituted the major components of this essential oil. Limonene predominating in the Citrus x limon (L.) Burm. f. oil did not icorrespond to the best activity.

When a Fe 3+ -TPTZ (2,4,6-tripyridyl-s-triazine) complex is reduced to the Fe 2+ form by an antioxidant under acidic conditions, an intense blue color develops with an absorption maximum at 593 nm. The antioxidant effect (reducing ability) can be evaluated by monitoring the formation of a Fe 2+ -TPTZ complex with a spectrophotometer [59] .

The antioxidant activity of Pistacia atlantica Desf. leaf oils from diverse origins of Algeria showed weak ability for scavenging DPPH free radicals, at least when compared to those of references (BHT and BHA). In contrast, the same oils had a higher antioxidant capacity relative to the antioxidant of reference ascobic acid when measured through the FRAP assay [78] . In the same assay, the authors also reported diverse activities depending on the harvesting place. The best activity was found in the oil obtained from Laghouat, mainly constituted by α-pinene + α-thujene, camphene and spathulenol.

By comparing the antioxidant activity measured by DPPH radical scavenging and ferric reducing power (FRAP) of Zingiber officinale Roscoe and Cuminum cyminum L. oils, El-Ghorab et al. (2010) [79] reported almost similar trends in both methods. Cuminum cyminum, mainly constituted by cuminal, γ-terpinene, pinocarveol,, carotol, α-pinene, sabinene, β-terpineol and linalool, presented the best activity.

Eugenia caryophyllus (clove) showed the highest ferric reducing capacity in terms of Trolox ® concentrations, such as in the DPPH method, in contrast to the TBARS method, in which Thymus vulgaris showed to be more effective [52] . According to the same authors, a significant linear correlation between FRAP values and total phenolic contents of the essential oils analysed were observed, except for the Thymus vulgaris essential oil.

Amomum tsao-ko oil with low antioxidant activity measured through the TBARS method [70] , as reported above, also had weak ability for scavenging DPPH free radicals and low ferric reducing power, mainly due to the low phenolic content of the oils [56] .

The antioxidant measurement by DPPH and FRAP methods showed that the essential oil of Eugenia caryophyllus exhibited higher activity than the volatile aglycone fraction obtained after enzymatic hydrolysis with β-glucosidase from bitter almonds of the extract and further extraction from the aqueous layer with n-pentane [80] . In the DPPH method, the antioxidant activity of clove oil was higher than the volatile aglycone fraction, although both samples have high eugenol content. This lower activity could be attributed and according to the authors to the antagonism among other constituents present in small amounts in this fraction. The reducing capacity of the essential oil was also higher than that of the volatile aglycone fraction. Nevertheless in this assay the reference eugenol had weak ability, whereas in the DPPH method it possessed considerable activity. Such a difference could be explained by the different polarity for FRAP method compared with DPPH method. "Waterlike" solvents induce a dramatic decrease in the hydrogen atom-donating capability in comparison with ethyl alcohol used in DPPH method [80] .

Seasonal qualitative and quantitative differences in composition and antioxidant activities of male and female leaf essential oils of Pistacia atlantica were observed. The main components of male leaf essential oil were α-pinene/α-thujene, spathulenol and bicyclogermacrene. The major component of female leaf essential oil was δ-3-carene. The seasonal variation showed that most of the main components of the oils reached theirs highest values in September. The highest antioxidant capacity to scavenge free DPPH radicals was reached in the month of June for male oils and during the months of September -October for the female oils. The high reducing power for male oil was detected during the month of June and for the female oil was in August. The antioxidant activity of the female oil was almost ten times higher than ascorbic acid in the FRAP assay [81] .

Another method to evaluate antioxidant ability is based on the reduction of Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ in which the yellow colour of the test solution changes to various shades of green and blue, depending on the reducing power of each sample. The presence of reducing agents causes the conversion of Fe 3+ /ferricyanide complex to the ferrous form that may be followed at 700 nm due to the formation of Perl's Prussian blue Fe 4 [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3 . Increasing absorbance at 700 nm indicates an increase in reductive ability [44] . Several authors along with other antioxidant activity assays also tested the reducing power of the essential oils of Himalayan Lauraceae species [44] , Myrtus communis var. italica [46] , Hymenocrater longiflorus [47] , Origanum onites L. [82] and Psammogeton canescens [49] . In this case, the antioxidant activity measured by the β-carotene bleaching and DPPH tests showed weak activity. The authors attributed such activity to the low concentration of phenolic compounds present in the essential oils, nevertheless the reducing power of the same samples is similar to that of the reference ascorbic acid, mainly at higher concentrations [49] .

One of the possible mechanisms of the antioxidative action is the chelation of transition metals. Transition metal ions can stimulate lipid peroxidation by participating in the generation of initiating species and by accelerating peroxidation, decomposing lipid hydroperoxides into other components which are able to abstract hydrogen, perpetuating the chain of reaction of lipid peroxidation [52] .

One method usually used for the determination of chelating activity uses ferrozine, which can quantitatively from complexes with Fe 2+ . In the presence of other chelating agents, the complex formation is disrupted, giving rise to a decrease of the red colour of the complex ferrozine-Fe 2+ . Measurement of the rate of colour reduction therefore allows estimation of the chelating activity of the coexisting chelator [46] . Essential oils of Myrtus communis, Thymus marschallianus and Thymus proximus generally did not present chelating activity [46, 54] . The sole exception was the essential oils of flowers of myrtle. The authors [46] explained this activity to the presence of eugenol and methyl eugenol in its essential oil, whereas these two components only belong to a minor fraction of leaf and stem essential oils. These dihydroxylated compounds would be necessary to form chelated Fe 2+ . Leaf and stem oils had as main components 1,8-cineole and terpinen-4-ol, monohydroxylated compounds that would be unable to chelate ferrous ions [46] . Concerning the essential oils of spice plants used in a Mediterranean diet, all of them were able to chelate Fe 2+ and did so in a concentration-dependent manner [52] . At all concentrations assayed Rosmarinus officinalis L. and Salvia officinalis essential oils showed the highest values for chelating Fe 2+ . All the oils studied were better chelators of Fe 2+ than ascorbic acid and BHT, used as references [52] .

Among the oxygen radicals, hydroxyl is the most reactive one, inducing severe damage to the adjunct biomolecules. There are several ways to ascertain the ability to form hydroxyl radicals. One of them is the deoxyribose test. This method includes a mixture of ferric chloride (FeCl 3 ) and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), which in the presence of ascorbic acid forms Fe 2+ -EDTA, and oxidized form of ascorbic acid. After addition of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), Fe 3+ -EDTA and HO • are formed. This is the so-called Fenton reaction, which generates the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (Fe 2+ + H 2 O 2 → Fe 3+ + HO− + HO • ). Hydroxyl radicals that are not scavenged by any component of the mixture attack the deoxyribose and degrade it into several fragments. Some of these fragments are capable of reacting with thiobarbituric acid after heating and in an acidic pH, originating a pink pigment that can be quantified by spectrophotometry [5] . There are other methods that did not use deoxyribose but other components such as benzoic acid or safranine. Using these methods several authors have evaluated the hydroxyl radical scavenging ability of essential oils [51, 53, 54, 57, 83, 84] .

The ability to scavenge hydroxyl radicals of the essential oils of Thymus marschallianus and Thymus proximus were evaluated using the safranine method and the authors reported that the latter oil was more effective than the former. The activity of both oils were dose-dependent and they were mainly constituted by thymol, p-cymene and γ-terpinene [54] . Patil et al. (2010) [51] have compared two methods (deoxyribose and benzoic acid) on the hydroxyl radical scavenging ability of Ageratum conyzoides, mainly constituted by the phenolic chromenes precocene I and precocene II, and they obtained different responses according to the method used. In the benzoic acid hydroxylation method, the essential oil presented better activity than in the deoxyribose method. The authors explained such results to the relative reactivity of hydroxyl radical towards the substrates deoxyribose and benzoic acid.

Among Portuguese Thymus species collected in different places of this country, Thymus camphoratus Hoffmanns. & Link, Thymus caespititius Brot., and Thymus capitellatus Hoffmanns. & Link oils from different origins were significantly more effective in scavenging hydroxyl radicals than the remaining samples. Borneol, camphor, α-terpineol, 1,8-cineole, camphene, α-pinene and p-cymene constituted the major compounds of these essential oils in different relative amounts. The oils in which thymol or carvacrol predominated did not present significant activities, which according to the authors [53] indicated that these phenolic compounds are not determinant in the ability for scavenging hydroxyl radicals.

The oils from young and mature leaves of Ageratum scoparia Waldst. & Kit. displayed a high degree of hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. However, the scavenging activity of principle constituents, β-myrcene and p-cymene, was very less compared to that of oils. The same authors [83] also evaluated the antioxidant activity of the samples by the DPPH method and also reported less activity of the main constituents of the oils than the essential oils, nevertheless the mature leaf oils were more effective as antioxidants than young leaf oils.

The mature fruits of Athamanta turbith ssp. hungarica and Athamanta turbith ssp. haynaldii are rich in essential oils, myristicin being the main component of both oils [84] . The capacity for scavenging hydroxyl radicals was evaluated and the authors found that both oils had similar ability. When the activity was evaluated by the DPPH method, the authors reported that Athamanta turbith ssp. hungarica was the most effective, albeit with less ability than the references used (quercetin and ascorbic acid) [84] .

The capacity of the essential oils obtained from the aerial parts or from the fruits of Foeniculum vulgare for scavenging hydroxyl radicals was always less than 50%, at the concentrations assayed (100-2,000 mg/mL) [57] . Mannitol, the reference used in this assay, showed a similar scavenging percentage at ≈2,000 mg/mL. Only higher concentrations presented percentages >50%.

Xanthine oxidase is a dehydrogenase enzyme that transfers electrons to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ), reducing it to NADH, and oxidizes xanthine or hypoxanthine to uric acid. Nevertheless, under stress conditions, the dehydrogenase is converted to an oxidase enzyme and, under these conditions, the enzyme reduces oxygen instead of NAD + . On this way, there is a reduction of dioxygen to superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. Superoxide anion can be generated by this system (the hypoxanthine -xanthine oxidase) or using a non-enzymatic reaction. In this case, superoxide anion is generated through the reaction of phenazine methosulphate in the presence of NADH and dioxygen. In both cases, superoxide anion reduces nitro-blue tetrazolium (NBT) into formazan which is followed spectrophotometrically [5] .

The superoxide anion scavenging activity of Portuguese Thymus oils were evaluated by the enzymatic hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase system [53] . From the 28 essential oils evaluated, only Thymus zygis ssp. sylvestris and Thymus capitellatus collected in diferent places of Portugal had superoxide anion scavenging activity >50%. In Thymus zygis ssp. sylvestris prevailed thymol or carvacrol, whereas in Thymus capitellatus oils, borneol and 1,8-cineole dominated. Such results seem to indicate that the phenolic compounds are not the only ones able to scavenge superoxide anion, as already reported for hydroxyl radical scavenging [53] .

Inflammation is a normal protective response induced by tissue injury or infection and functions to combat invaders in the body (microorganisms and non-self cells) and to remove dead or damaged host cells [85] .

In the inflammatory response there is an increase of permeability of endothelial lining cells and influxes of blood leukocytes into the interstitium, oxidative burst, and release of cytokines [interleukins and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)]. At the same time, there is also an induction of the activity of several enzymes (oxygenases, nitric oxide synthases, peroxidases) as well as the arachidonic acid metabolism. In the inflammatory process there is also the expression of cellular adhesion molecules, such as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) [22] .

In addition to the ability of some essential oils to scavenge free radicals, there is also evidence that some essential oils possess anti-inflammatory activity. For example, chamomile essential oil has been used for centuries as an anti-inflammatory and also for alleviating the symptoms associated with eczema, dermatitis and other pronounced irritation [17] . However, there are other examples of essential oils (eucalyptus, rosemary, lavender, millefolia) along with other plants (pine, clove and myrrh) that have been used as mixed formulations as anti-inflammatory agents [86] .

Carrageenan-induced mouse paw oedema is frequently used to determine the anti-inflammatory activity of diverse bioactive compounds such as plant extracts and essential oils [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] [95] . If this method allows screening the anti-inflammatory of samples, very little information is given about its mechanism.

The anti-inflammatory activity of essential oils may be attributed not only to their antioxidant activities but also to their interactions with signalling cascades involving cytokines and regulatory transcription factors, and on the expression of pro-inflammatory genes.

Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that is released from cell membranes by phospholipase A 2 under the stimulus of several factors associated with inflammation. The same fatty acid is metabolised by cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) pathways in different eicosanoids such as prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs) in diverse cells and thromboxane A 2 in platlets [22] . Two isoforms of COX, COX-1 and COX-2, have been reported. COX-1 is a constitutive enzyme whilst COX-2 protein is only slightly expressed in most normal mammalian tissues in response to physical, chemical and biological stimuli, including UV light exposure, dioxin and LPS (lipopolyssacharide) insult [96] .

The prostaglandins, especially prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) amplify the pain mechanism and enhance vascular permeability whereas the leukotrienes contract the smooth muscles of blood vessels, enhance vascular permeability and mediate proinflammatory and allergic responses [97] . Figure 1 represents the sites where essential oils or their main components have been detected as acting anti-inflammatory agents.

Aloe vera ( [43] . More examples of 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors included some Salvia essential oils from South Africa. The authors attributed such activities to the presence of 1,8-cineole, α-pinene and βcaryophyllene in the essential oils [98] . The same major components present in the essential oils of four indigenous South African Helichrysum species were also reported to inhibit 5-lipoxygenase [99] . Chamazulene and α-bisabolol are examples of other components, present in the essential oil of chamomile, with anti-inflammatory activities partly due to the inhibition of leukotriene synthesis since they appear to be good 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors [17] . The essential oils of leaves and rhizomes of Alpinia murdochii Ridl., Alpinia scabra (Blume) Náves and leaves of Alpinia pahangensis Ridl. also showed to be good 5-lipoxynease inhibitors. β-Pinene, α-pinene and sabinene were the main components of the leaf oils, whilst the sesquiterpenes γ-selinene, α-selinene and α-panasinsen predominated in the rhizome oils [100] . The oils Torreya nucifera Siebold et Zucc. oil, mainly constituted by limonene, δ-3-carene and αpinene, was a COX-2 selective inhibitor having significant inhibitory effects on PGE 2 production [101] . 1,8-Cineole, a terpene oxide, present in many essential oils was shown to inhibit leukotrienes (LTB 4 ) and prostaglandins (PGE 2 ), both pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism [102] .

Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are two important pro-inflammatory cytokines with a relevant role in the inflammatory disorders. The major source of TNF-α is the cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage although T lymphocytes, neutrophils and mast cells also produce this pro-inflammatory cytokine. IL-1β is produced by a variety of cells types, including monocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells [103] . The production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines may be induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that is an endotoxin localised on Gram negative bacteria cell walls capable to activate macrophages, stimulating the production of inflammatory cytokines [104] . However, Gram positive bacteria may also contribute to the stimulation in the production of cytokines. Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) represents a class of amphiphilic molecules anchored to the outer face of the cytoplasmic membrane in Gram positive bacteria that causes cytokine induction in mononuclear phagocytes and a synergism with peptidoglycan (PG) has been described resulting in higher cytokine levels [105] .

The essential oil of Cheistocalyx operculatus, which chemical composition was not determined, significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced secretion of IL-1β and TNF-α cytokines in RAW 264.7 cells, a mouse macrophage-like cell line [103] . However, and some years earlier, some authors had already reported that tea tree oil (Melaleuca alternifolia Cheel.), mainly its major component (terpinen-4-ol), was able to suppress the production in vitro of TNF-α and IL-1β, as well as IL-8, IL-10 and PGE 2 by LPS-activated human blood monocytes [106] . Six years later, Caldefie et al. (2006) [107] also reported the capacity of the essential oil of that species for suppressing IL-2 pro-inflammatory cytokine and stimulating the secretion of the anti-inflammatory IL-4 and IL-10 cytokines in human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (monocytes and lymphocytes) stimulated by the lectin phytohemagglutinin (PHA) from Phaseolus vulgaris L.. Also using PHA from Phaseolus vulgaris for stimulating mononuclear cells, Hammer et al. (2000) [108] reported that the essential oils of Taxandria fragrans (J. R. Wheller & N. G. Marchant) J. R. Wheeler & N. G. Marchant, comb. nov., mainly constituted by 1,8-cineole, α-pinene and linalool, decreased the production of the cytokines TNF-α and IL-6.

The ability to inhibit IL-1β and IL-6 production but not TNF-α was attributed to 1,8-cineole, santoline, spathulenol and caryophyllene oxide, major constituents of the essential oil of Cinnamomum osmophloeum Kaneh. leaves [109] . Rosmarinus officinalis L. oil, mainly constituted by 1,8-cineole along with α-pinene, camphor and p-cymene was only able to reduce the pro-inflammatory IL-6 production in the mouse colon in which colitis was induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS), not suppressing IL-1β [110] .

Cinnamaldehyde, isolated from an essential oil produced from the leaves of Cinnamomum osmophloeum, was reported to inhibit the secretion of IL-1β and TNF-α within LPS or lipoteichoic acid (LTA) stimulated murine J774A.1 macrophages. Cinnamaldehyde also suppressed the production of these cytokines from LPS stimulated human blood monocytes derived primary macrophages and human THP-1 monocytes [111] .

Cordia verbenacea D. C. essential oil significantly reduced TNF-α levels but not IL-1β production in the subcutaneous tissue of the rat paw injected with carrageenan [112] . Some authors showed that from the essential oil of Cordia verbenacea, only α-humelene was able to reduce significantly the increase of TNF-α and IL-1β levels in the subcutaneous tissue of the rat paw after LPS treatment [113] or in carrageenan-injected rats, whereas (-)-trans-caryophyllene diminished only TNF-α release [114] .

Investigating the effect of Cryptomeria japonica D. Don essential oil on the LPS-treated RAW 264.7 cells, through enzyme immunoassay, some researchers reported the remarkable inhibition of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α by that oil [115] . In this essential oil, kaurene, elemol, γ-eudesmol and sabinene prevailed.

α-Thujone, β-thujone, camphor, and caryophyllene were the main components of Artemisia fukudo oil that were able to inhibit the release of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in LPS-treated RAW 264.7 cells [116] . The mixture of stereoisomers geranial (E-isomer) and neral (Z-isomer), known as citral, constitutes the main components of Cymbopogon citratus (DC) Stapf. (lemongrass) essential oil. This essential oil revealed to be capable to suppress IL-1β and IL-6 in LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages of normal mice [117] . The same authors attributed similar properties to the eugenol, the main component present in the essential oil of Syzygium aromaticum (L.) Merr. et Perry (clove) [118] . Other authors also found that eugenol on human macrophages (U937) under the stimulation of LPS blocked the release of IL-1β, TNF-α and PGE 2 [119] . Whether some essential oils are able to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, some of them, particularly lemongrass, geranium and spearmint and their main components (citral, geraniol, citronellol, and carvone), can also suppress TNF-α-induced neutrophil adherence responses [120] . According to these authors, those essential oils or their major components do not affect TNF-α but do affect the neutrophil function to suppress their adhesion. Therefore and concerning lemongrass and citral and as reported above, they can also suppress IL-1β and IL-6 pro-inflammatory cytokines [117] . In other work, Lin et al. (2008) [121] Therefore, the hepatoprotective activity of myristicin might be, at least in part, due to the inhibition of TNF-α release from macrophages, according to the same authors [122] .

Animals (mice) pretreated with Pterodon emarginatus Vogel. oil presented a marked reduction of IL-1 and TNF-α levels after submitted to a single intrapleural injection of carrageenan [123] . trans-Caryophyllene, β-elemene and germacrene D were the major components present in the present oil.

The anti-inflammatory effects of diverse combination of thyme (p-cymene and thymol as main components) and oregano (carvacrol as major component) oils on mice with TNBS-induced colitis showed that some combinations lowered the amounts of IL-1β and IL-6 cytokines [124] .

The inhibitory effect of some of the essential oils on the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines reported in this chapter seems to be mediated by suppressing gene expression of these cytokines. Such was described by some authors because they found that the essential oils studied significantly suppressed the protein and mRNA expression of the cytokines in stimulated cells, assuming therefore, that the inhibitory effect of these essential oils on the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines occurs mainly at transcriptional level [103, 116, 123, 124] . Thyme essential oil, mainly constituted by pcymene and thymol, only at high concentrations (5,000 mg/L) significantly inhibited total mRNA IL-1β expression in the mouse colon in which colitis was induced by TNBS, not inhibiting significantly IL-6 expression [125] .

Nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandins and cytokines participate in inflammatory events. NO synthase (NOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX) catalise the formation of NO and prostaglandins, respectively. COX-2 and inducible NOS are considered as being inducible forms of these enzymes.

There are three isoforms of NOS: constitutive (cNOS), endothelial (eNOS) and the other is cytokine-inducible NOS (iNOS). Inflammatory mediators such as IL-1, TNF-α or LPS stimulate iNOS expression in rodent macrophages in vitro. NO production and/or iNOS expression are also induced by inflammatory mediators in a wide variety of mammalian cells, producing large amounts of NO for prolonged time periods [25] . iNOS catalises the production of large amount of NO from L-arginine and molecular oxygen, is mainly triggered and regulated by a series of signalling pathways including nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) transcription factor and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) [116] .

The inhibition of activity or expression of COX-2 by some anti-inflammatory is due to the interference with the signalling mechanisms that regulate the COX-2 gene. In this gene, four transcription factors including NF-κB, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), activator protein 1 (AP-1) and CRE-binding protein (CREB) have been identified as regulators of COX-2 transcription [22, 126] . NF-κB and MAPKs are of current interest as potential targets in therapies form diverse inflammatory symptoms.

NF-κB is a transcriptional regulator that consists of homo-and heterodimers of proteins (p65 or RelA, p50/p105, c-Rel, p52/p100 and RelB). NF-κB is maintained as a latent form in the cytoplasm of cells where it is complexed to IκB inhibitor protein. Seven members of the IκB family of proteins have been identified and includes IκB-α. Upon activation of NF-κB, IκB-α is phosphorylated by IκB kinases (IKK) leading to proteasome-dependent degradation of IκB, which allows a rapid translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus where it binds to DNA. The most predominant NF-κB dimmer activated is p65:p50. Translocation of p65:p50 to the nucleus results in the transcription of several proinflammatory genes, such as cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) and inducible enzymes (iNOS and COX-2) [127, 128] .

In macrophages and other types of cells, LPS activates three subclasses of MAPKs: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38. Studies have revealed that some compounds are able to suppress proinflammatory cytokines and NF-κB, to inhibit the COX-2 and iNOS expression inhibiting some of these MAPKS [129] [130] [131] .

Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPARs) are ligand-activated transcription factors that belong to the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors, which also includes receptors for vitamin D, vitamin A, thyroid hormone, bile acids, and steroid hormones. The PPAR subfamily comprises three isotypes, PPARα, PPARβ/δ, and PPARγ, which play various roles in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, cell proliferation and differentiation, and inflammation [132, 133] .

The anti-inflammatory activities of PPARs are partially effectuated by inhibition of NF-κB. PPARs are able to attenuate NF-κB function either by interfering with the transcription activating capacity of the NF-κB complex or by regulating genes that suppress the activation of NF-κB. By physical interaction with components of the NF-κB complex, PPARα impairs binding of NF-κB to the DNA and subsequent activation of inflammatory genes. Secondly, PPARα activation results in increased expression of IκB, the inhibitory protein that prevents the transfer of NF-κB to the nucleus [134, 135] . On the other hand, Inoue et al. (2000) [136] consider that COX-2 expression is regulated by a negative feedback loop, mediated through PPARγ, especially in macrophages, indicating that PPARγ participates in cell type-specific control of COX-2 expression.

Only the essential oils of Teucrium brevifolia Schreber and Teucrium montbretii Benth. ssp. heliotropiifolium (Barbey) Davis from a group of four studied effectively inhibited LPS-induced NO production in macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. Spathulenol and δ-cadinene predominated in Teucrium brevifolia whereas carvacrol and caryophyllene oxide dominated in Teucrium montbretii. Such components revealed to be of great importance on the inhibition of NO production and, therefore, on the inflammation inhibition, since the main components of the remaining Teucrium species were caryophyllene and 4-vinyl guaiacol in Teucrium flavum L., and carvacrol and caryophyllene in Teucrium polium ssp. capitatum (L.) Arcangeli [137] .

The essential oils of Fortunella japonica var. margarita (GumGyul) and Citrus sunki (JinGyul), which limonene predominared in both types of oils, also markedly inhibited LPS-induced NO production in RAW 264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that they had anti-inflammatiry effects, according to the authors [138] .

Incubation of RAW 264.7 cells with Origanum ehrenbergii Boiss. oil, in which thymol and pcymene predominated, induced a significant inhibitory effect on the LPS-induced NO production. Origanum syriacum L. predominatly composed by carvacrol and thymol did not show such ability [139] . However, more examples of NO inhibition can be reported, for example the production of NO was also inhibited by the citrus peel waste essential oil in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages [140] , or the oil of Distichoselinum tenuifolium (Lag.) Garcia Martin & Silvestre, mainly composed by myrcene, that significantly inhibited NO production stimulated by LPS in macrophages, demonstrating, therefore, in vitro anti-inflammatory properties [141] . PGE 2 was only inhibited by LPS-stimulated macrophages J774.A1 cells when treated with high concentrations of (-)-linalool. The same was observed for the COX-2 expression. The same monoterpene inhibited NO release but did not inhibit the increase of iNOS expression indicating that the inhibitory activity of linalool was mainly attributed to the iNOS enzyme activity [142] .

In addition to the effect of Cryptomeria japonica essential oil on the LPS-treated RAW 264.7 cells, which presented a remarkable inhibition of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, as reported above, the authors also detected an inhibition of NO production by reducing iNOS protein and mRNA iNOS expression as well as a diminution of PGE 2 due to the reduction of COX-2 protein and COX-2 mRNA expression [115] .

The inhibitory effects of Abies koreana Horstmann's Silberlocke essential oil, mainly constituted by bornyl acetate, limonene and α-pinene, on pro-inflammatory mediators (NO and PGE 2 ) were related to the modulation of iNOS and COX-2 expression, since the expression of iNOS and COX-2 mRNA and iNOS and COX-2 protein was reduced [143] .

An inhibitory effect of Farfugium japonicum (L.) Kitamura essential oil, namely constituted by 1undecene, 1-nonene and β-caryophyllene, on NO and PGE 2 production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells were found by Kim et al. (2008) [144] , with a concomitant inhibition of iNOS and COX-2 mRNA expression, might explain the anti-inflammatory activity of this oil. The same authors in another work, and using the essential oil of Illicium anisatum L., mainly constituted by 1,8-cineole, also demonstrated its capacity for inhibiting NO and PGE 2 production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells, along with the decrease of iNOS and COX-2 proteins and iNOS and COX-2 mRNA expression [145] .

Following carrageenan injection into the rat paw, the systemic treatment with α-humulene and (-)trans-caryophyllene markedly inhibited the expression of both COX-2 and iNOS. The possible mechanisms involved were not performed by the authors [114] .

α-Humulene and trans-caryophyllene, the main constituents of Cordia verbenacea inhibited the LPS-induced NF-kB activation and neutrophil migration in the rat paw, however unable to inhibit LPS-induced MAP kinase activation [113] . The essential oils of diverse Pimpinella species and their isolates were able to inhibit NF-kB transcription induced by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) in SW1353 cells. However, they did not present similar activities. The most remarkable activity was reported for three Pimpinella species and five pure compounds: Pimpinella corymbosa Boiss., Pimpinella tragium Vill. ssp. polyclada (Boiss. et Heldr. Tutin), Pimpinella rhodanta Boiss. oils and 4-(2-propenyl)phenylangelate, 4-(3-methyloxiranyl)phenyltiglate, 4-methoxy-2-(3-methyloxiranyl)phenyl isobutyrate, 4-methoxy-2-(3-methyloxiranyl)phenylangelate and epoxypseudoisoeugenol-2-methylbutyrate [146] . These results also indicated the importance of a common structure (epoxyphenylpropanoid moiety) present in some of these pure compounds for the best anti-inflammatory activity.

Cinnamaldehyde-mediated inhibition of cytokines production found by Chao et al. (2008) [111] , and reported above, may be, at least on part, due to the reduction of ROS release as well as of those of JNK and ERK within LPS stimulated J774A.1 macrophages.

The fruit essential oils of Cinnamomum insularimontanum Hayata and citral were revealed to possess significant inhibitory effects on NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Citral exhibited an inhibitory activity in LPS-induced iNOS protein expression, not found for COX-2. The authors studied the effect of citral on NF-κB pathway for enlightening the mechanism of the citralmediated inhibition of iNOS transcription. The authors concluded that citral could prevent the degradation of IκBα in LPS-induced inflammation and reduce the p50 NF-κB levels in nuclear fractions [121] . In another study, it was reported that in human macrophage-like U937 cells, citral suppressed both LPS-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expression, dose-dependently. Moreover, citral induced the mRNA expression of the PPARα and the PPARγ, suggesting that citral activates PPARα andγ, and regulates COX-2 expression [147] . A same behaviour was observed for carvacrol.

In human macrophage-like U937 cells, carvacrol suppressed LPS-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expression, suggesting that carvacrol regulates COX-2 expression through its agonistic effect on PPARγ [132] . However, this property of carvacrol was not as remarkable as was that of citral [147] .

Artemisia fukudo Makino essential oil, mainly constituted by α-thujone, β-thujone, camphor, and caryophyllene attenuates LPS-induced inflammation by suppressing NF-κB and MAPK activation in RAW 264.7 macrophages. The essential oil in LPS-induced inflammation act through the reduction of IκBα phosphorilation and blockage of NF-κB and translocation of p50 and p65 units to the nucleus. The same oil also suppressed the LPS-induced activation of phosphorilation of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPKs [116] .

Cleistocalyx operculatus (Roxb.) Merr and Perry oil not only significantly inhibited LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-1b, in RAW 264.7 cells, as reported above, but also suppressed the mRNA expression of TNF-a and IL-1b as well as blocked LPS-induced transcriptional activation of NF-κB and nuclear translocation of p65 subunit [103] .

In a short report, Chainy et al. (2000) [148] described that anethole, eugenol and isoeugenol inhibited TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation in ML1-a cells. The same authors also reported that anethole inhibited the degradation of IκBα, blocking its phosphorylation in TNF-stimulated ML1-a cells. In the same cells and with TNF stimulation, anethole did not induce the phosphorylation of MAP kinase. Besides NF-κB and MAP kinase, anethole also blocked TNF-induced JNK and AP-1.

Early growth response factor-1 (Erg-1) is a transcription factor that plays a regulatory role in the expression of many important genes of inflammation (cytokine, cell adhesion molecules, and immunoreceptors). The human monocyte cell line THP-1 is often used as a model for tissue macrophages. Zhou et al. (2007) [149] showed that 1,8-cineole inhibited the Egr-1 synthesis and nuclear localization induced by LPS in THP-1 cells but did not affect the LPS-induced NF-κB expression in nuclei. Therefore, the authors concluded that 1,8-cineole may preferentially block the effect of Egr-1 by inhibiting the synthesis of Egr-1 and preventing Egr-1 nuclear internalization instead of NF-κB inhibition [149] . Some authors reported that α-pinene clearly inhibited the translocation of NF-κB/p65 protein into nuclei in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells, through the increase of expression of IκBα protein [150, 151] .

The essential oil from the leaves of Juniperus oxycedrus L. of the Iberian flora, mainly constituted by α-pinene, showed a great inhibition of IL-1-induced NO production in the human chondrocytic cell line C-28/12. The same oil and a α-pinene-rich fraction reduced markedly IL-1-induced IκBα degradation and phosphorylation, NF-κB-DNA binding activity and NO production [152] .

The antioxidant activity of essential oils has been target of investigation due to their potential as preservatives, cosmeceuticals or nutraceuticals in the food and cosmetic industries. The search for antiinflammatory activities in essential oils has also increased during these last years. This work reports the antioxidant activities of essential oils which may act by preventing lipid peroxidation, scavenging free radicals or, and in very few cases, chelating metal ions. Some works also showed that the constituents of essential oil act synergistically because their main components when used as references have less activity than the essential oil. Therefore, synergism and antagonism studies must be developed.

Recently, Cabrera and Prieto (2010) [153] were able, for the first time, to show the application of artificial neural networks (ANN) on the prediction of the antioxidant activity of essential oils in two experimental in vitro models: in the DPPH and linoleic acid models. They used about 30 components from 80 that are described as possessing antioxidant activity and the results confirmed that this computational technique was reliable for predicting the antioxidant activity of essential oils from some of its components. Some of them are also reported in the present work (thymol, carvacrol, eugenol, pcymene) among others. Nevertheless, the authors only tested two models. There are much more, those that allow evaluating the ability for scavenging ROS or RNS or chelating metals. In this way, the work is not finished and much more needs to be done.

According to the literature, it was possible to conclude that depending on the chemical compositon of the oils, they can act as anti-inflammatory affecting the arachidonic metabolism or the cytokines production, or on the modulation of pro-inflammatory gene expression.

The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of the essential oils are well documented; nevertheless their uses can be hampered due to the chemical variability of the oils. Several factors including harvesting time of the aromatic plant, climatic and agronomic conditions, vegetative development of the plant, the plant part used, type of extraction used can be considered as responsible for fluctuations in their chemical compositions.

Sparse evidence of MERS-CoV infection among animal workers living in Southern Saudi Arabia during 2012

First reported in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in September 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is now frequently detected and causing high mortality among persons living or traveling in the Arabian Peninsula. 1 Retrospective testing has revealed that MERS-CoV was also circulating in Zarqa, Jordan as early as April 2012, causing at least 2 deaths and likely 7 close contact infections. 2 Since then, virus spread has seemingly increased. Between April 2012 and May 2014, there have been 536 reports of laboratory-confirmed human cases of MERS-CoV, of which, 145 (27%) have perished. 3 The majority of the initially reported cases of MERS-CoV in KSA were sporadic, associated with severe illness, and diagnosed in tertiary care hospitals. 3, 4 As surveillance efforts have expanded, a number of MERS-CoV cases with milder clinical disease have been recognized. In this study of archive sera, we sought to examine evidence that subclinical MERS-CoV infections may have occurred in early 2012.

This study was approved by two institutional review boards (KSA Ministry of Health and Western IRB). Banked serum samples were collected using convenience sampling in July 2012 from 300 animal-exposed and 50 non-matched human controls residing in Jazan region, KSA, as part of a study investigating human Rift Valley fever exposure. The crosssectional, convenience sample of human sera was chosen for its self-reported exposure to domestic animals, such as camels, as studies have documented increasing evidence that camels are a reservoir for MERS-CoV 5,6 and human MERS-CoV infections were later reported in the area.

After informed consent was obtained, demographic and domestic animal exposure data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Blood samples were then collected and transported on wet ice to the KSA Ministry of Health (MoH) laboratory in the Jazan region, KSA. Aliquots of sera were shipped to the University of Florida for serological assessment.

Questionnaire data were used to analyze demographic characteristics and generate animal exposure data. In addition, an epidemic curve was developed using published reports to identify the dates of onset for the MERS-CoV cases in KSA. 3, 4 MERS-CoV spike pseudoparticle neutralization assay A MERS-CoV spike protein pseudotyped lentiviral vector was constructed and provided by the laboratory of Malik Peiris of Hong Kong University. This assay is considered to be a more sensitive test compare to virus neutralization assay. 6, 7 The MERS-S pseudoparticles were used in a pseudoparticle neutralization test (ppNT) as first described elsewhere. 6 In brief, the ppNT assay included infecting monolayers of Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) in a single well (96-well plate format; 1 9 10 4 cells/well) with HIV-MERS-S-pseudotyped lentiviral vector having 5 ng p24. The MERS-S pseudoparticles were pre-incubated with serially diluted sera for 60 min at 4°C and then added to the cells in triplicate. After 2 days of incubation, 100 ll of luciferase substrate, ONE-Glo luciferase Assay System (Promega Madison, WI, USA), was added. The relative level of MERS-S pseudoparticle infection of the cells as luciferase activity was measured in a BioTek Synergy MX multimode plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT. Endpoint MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies titers were determined as the highest serum dilution resulting in 90% reduction of luciferase relative to a negative serum (BSA) control. Polyclonal rabbit antisera to MERS-CoV obtained from the NIH/NIAID Rocky Mountain Research Laboratory was used as a positive control. Sensitivity of the assay in our laboratory was compared to that of the Peiris Laboratory at University of Hong Kong, where it was developed, by shipping an aliquot of this positive control which was independently titrated in the ppNT assay. Both our and Peiris' laboratory found the neutralizing titer of the polyclonal rabbit sera to be comparable to that measured by the Rocky Mountain Laboratories live virus neutralization assay (1:2560).

The study population was predominately male between 15 and 84 years of age, of them, approximately 84% of participants were between the ages of 20 and 59 years. The participants were enrolled from the governorates of Abu Arish, Al Aridah, Al Darb, Al Aydabi, Baish, Dhamad, Fifa, Jazan, Sabya, and Samtah. A small percentage (16.9%) of participants reported themselves to be semi-nomadic, with possible movement outside of the Jazan region. Nearly half (44%) of participants were from the Jazan Governorate. Among participants, 25% reported some form of contact with domestic animals including camels, cattle, horse, goats, or sheep and 17% reported daily contact with domestic camels during the 12 months to enrollment (see Table S1 ).

All serum samples were screened in triplicate at a dilution of 1:20. A specimen was considered as screening positive if the average of the three wells containing the sera exhibited a >50% reduction in luminescence in comparison to the luminescence negative (BSA) or no serum control. Thirteen sera (9 animal exposed and 4 controls) screened positive at 1:20, but upon titration of these sera in subsequent assays, none of them were reproducibly able to neutralize the MERS-CoV pseudotyped lentiviral vector at a serum dilution of 1:20.

The epidemiological curve of human MERS-CoV cases in KSA (Figure 1 ) reflects the occurrence of sporadic cases in 2012, low-level sustained transmission in 2013, and an epidemic spike between April and May 2014.

This study evaluated 350 banked serum samples collected in July 2012 from individuals with self-reported domestic animal exposure and controls in Jazan Region, KSA, for the presence of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies. None of the specimens tested positive using the MERS-S ppNT assay. Our negative results suggest population naivety to MERS-CoV infection in this region of KSA 1 month after the first earliest case was reported in another region of the country. 8 At the time samples were collected, there was no known evidence of human or animal infections with MERS-CoV from the Jazan region. 4 Since then multiple humans in Jazan have developed MERS-CoV infections.

As the first cases of MERS-CoV were identified, studies have postulated that camels are likely a reservoir for the virus in the Middle East. 5, 6, 9, 10 Given that 17% of participants of the animal-exposed participants reported daily contact with dromedary camels, we would have expected to find some serological evidence of infection if dromedary MERS-CoV was readily able to infect humans. Several other studies have reported similar results where no serological evidence of MERS-CoV infection was detected in domestic animalexposed populations, including abattoir workers in sites where infected camels have been documented. 10, 11 During October 2012, researchers in KSA collected and tested serum samples from 226 abattoir workers in Jeddah and Makkah. Using an immunofluorescence assay, none had evidence of elevated MERS-CoV antibody. 11 Similarly, in another 2013 study where nasal swabs from Egyptian camels suggested MERS-CoV was present, there was no evidence of seropositivity among the camel workers with intense contact to these same camels. 10 species are serving as additional reservoirs for this pathogen or serving as vectors in transferring infection from camels to humans. Alternatively, perhaps our assay lacks sensitivity, or MERS-CoV infection may produce a weak or transient immune response following mild or asymptomatic infection. Finally, it is possible that only a subset of the human population has the predilection to be infected by MERS-CoV, either because of genetic polymorphisms or unusual routes of exposure.

Similar to MERS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus began causing sporadic self-limited outbreaks in late 2002, after which it seemingly developed sustained human-to-human transmission, and spread internationally. 12 Post-epidemic studies of SARS have revealed a lowlevel circulation of the virus several months before it was first detected in humans in Guangdong Province of China, suggesting a period of time in which the virus adapted to human hosts. 13 While it is difficult to draw direct comparisons, it seems possible that MERS-CoV is demonstrating a similar transmission pattern, reflected by the sporadic outbreaks occurring in 2012, followed by sustained low-level transmission in 2013, and now showing a larger human infection KSA wave in 2014 ( Figure 1 ). 4 If the epidemiologic model of SARS is relevant to MERS, 13 this current progression in MERS-CoV ecology may presage much greater future MERS-CoV epidemics.

There still remain many questions regarding designing appropriate interventions to prevent or reduce MERS-CoV transmission. Of them, identification of risk factors for MERS-CoV infection, a comprehensive understanding of natural animal reservoirs and vectors, and better determining transmission pathways seem to be paramount in developing appropriate interventions. Priority should be given to addressing these questions if we hope to improve public health response to future index cases in new geographical areas. It seems prudent to allocate resources to further globally enhance surveillance to quickly identify MERS-CoV and to monitor for viral genetic changes as well as to conduct the necessary epidemiological studies to fill the aforementioned gaps in our knowledge regarding this new and dangerous threat.

Molecular Typing and Epidemiology Profiles of Human Adenovirus Infection among Paediatric Patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Infection in China

Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) have been recognised as pathogens that cause a broad spectrum of diseases. The studies on HAdV infection among children with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) are limited.

To investigate the prevalence, epidemiology, and genotype of HAdV among children with SARI in China.

Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) or induced sputum (IS) was collected from hospitalised children with SARIs in Beijing (representing Northern China; n = 259) and Zhejiang Province (representing Eastern China; n = 293) from 2007 to 2010. The prevalence of HAdV was screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by sequence typing of PCR fragments that targeted the second half of the hexon gene. In addition, co-infection with other human respiratory viruses, related epidemiological profiles and clinical presentations were investigated.

In total, 76 (13.8%) of 552 SARI patients were positive for HAdV, and the infection rates of HAdV in Northern and Eastern China were 20.1% (n = 52) and 8.2% (n = 24), respectively. HAdV co-infection with other respiratory viruses was frequent (infection rates: Northern China, 90.4%; Eastern China, 70.8%). The peak seasons for HAdV-B infection was winter and spring. Additionally, members of multiple species (Human mastadenovirus B, C, D and PLOS ONE |

Adenoviruses are ubiquitous, non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses [1] . Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are classified into 7 species (Human mastadenovirus A to G) and at least 69 recognized genotypes based on serology, whole-genome sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses [1] . The prevalence of different HAdV types varies among different geographical regions [2] . HAdVs have been recognised as pathogens that cause a broad spectrum of diseases [1, 2] , including acute respiratory infection (ARI), gastroenteritis, conjunctivitis, cystitis, and meningoencephalitis. ARI is prevalent in children, and is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in the paediatric population in developing countries [3, 4] . Numerous outbreaks of ARI caused by HAdV have been reported during the last decade in many countries including China [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . The HAdV types most commonly found in respiratory samples belong to HAdV-C (HAdV-1, -2, -5, -6) and HAdV-B (HAdV-3, -7) [2, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] ; however, severe or even fatal disease outbreaks are predominantly caused by only a few types (such as HAdV-14, -21 and -55) [2, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . The molecular typing by HAdV hexon sequences can help to accelerate the discrimination of types, resulting in timely epidemiological examinations and improved patient care [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Several studies have shown the association between severe respiratory infections in adult and HAdV species [7] [8] [9] ; however, reports among children with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in China are limited.

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and genotype (sequencing of the hexon gene after polymerase chain reaction [PCR] screening) of HAdVs among children with SARI in different areas of China from 2007 to 2010. HAdV infections are often associated with the co-infection of bacterial or viral agents [21] , frequently leading to severe clinical consequences in hospital patients. Thus, co-infection with other respiratory viruses of HAdV was also investigated.

This project was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Centre of Disease Control and Prevention of China, the Ethical Review Committee of Beijing Hospital, and the Ethics Committee of Wenzhou Medical College. Individual written informed consent was obtained from the parents or guardians of all of the participants.

We defined a case of SARI according to the World Health Organization case definition for all hospitalised children in whom the onset of illness occurred within 7 days of admission [22] . Basic demographic and clinical information and laboratory results were recorded for each patient using a standardised form. Specimens were collected on the day of admission. Two separate banks of specimens between May 2007 and March 2010 were used in this investigation. The first set consisted of 259 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) specimens collected from paediatric patients with SARI in Beijing (Northern China). The second specimen bank comprised 293 induced sputum (IS) specimens from paediatric patients with SARI in Zhejiang Province (Eastern China). All of the samples were collected from the patients at the first day of admission and placed in viral transport medium and stored at -80°C until tested.

Nucleic acids (both DNA and RNA) were extracted from 200 μL virus transport medium using the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

A partial hexon gene fragment was amplified by PCR to screen and type HAdV infection as previously described [16, 23] . The first-round PCR primers were AdTU7 (5 0 -GCCACCTTCTTCCCCATGGC-3 0 ) and AdTU4 0 (5 0 -GTAGCGTTGCCGGCCGAGAA-3 0 ) with 1004 bp PCR product; the second-round primers were AdnU-S 0 (5 0 -TTCCCCATGGCC-CACAACAC-3 0 ) and AdnU-A (5 0 -GCCTCGATGACGCCGCGGTG-3 0 ) with 956 bp PCR product. The PCR reactions contained 1.25 U FastStart Taq DNA Polymerase, 10× PCR Buffer with 2 mM MgCl 2 (Roche Diagnostic Systems Inc., Mannheim, Germany), 0.5 μM of each primer, 200 μM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (i.e., dATP, dGTP, dCTP, dTTP; TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan), and 5 μL nucleic acids (first round) or 2 μL first-round PCR product (second round) as a template in a total volume of 25 μL. PCR conditions comprised an initial denaturation step at 94°C for 10 min, followed by 36 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 50°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 2 min. The final step was an extension at 72°C for 7 min. The second round of PCR was conducted using the same PCR conditions described above for the first round.

After the nested-PCR amplification, 5 μL reaction mixtures was subjected to electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg ethidium bromide per mL. The positive products were gel purified for DNA sequencing using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA sequencing was performed using the Cycle Sequencing Kit (Qiagen) on a DNA analyser.

Specimens positive for HAdV were further tested for co-infection with other respiratory viruses by multiplex PCR and multiple reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), picornaviruses (PIC) including enteroviruses and rhinoviruses, influenza A and B virus, parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1, 2 and 3, human bocavirus (HBoV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and human coronavirus (HCoV), including HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1, as previously described [24, 25] .

The partial hexon gene sequences have been deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers KM377987-KM378038 and KM877524-KM877547. A total of 28 prototype reference sequences of HAdV used for comparisons with sequences from this study were obtained from GenBank (S1 Table) . These were aligned and manually adjusted using Clustal X2 and BioEdit. The phylogenetic tree was drawn based on the hexon region of adenovirus by the neighbourjoining (NJ) method using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software version 5.0.

Data were analysed by the chi-squared test using SAS software version 9.2. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

All of the samples were collected from inpatient children with SARI at hospitals in Beijing (n = 259) and Zhejiang Province (n = 293) from 2007 to 2010. The age and gender distributions are shown in Table 1 . The median age of this population is 7 and 7.5 months, respectively. The demographic characteristics of the Northern and Eastern Chinese population were matched well, and no significant differences were observed regarding gender and age distribution (P > 0.05).

In total, 76 (13.8%) of 552 SARI patients were positive for HAdV. The prevalence of HAdV among inpatient children with SARI in Northern China was 20.1% (n = 52), which is higher than that in Eastern China (8.2%, n = 24) (P < 0.0001). Most of the HAdV infections occurred in children aged 6 months to 2 years ( Table 2 ). The seasonal distribution indicated that most of the HAdV-B infections occurred during the winter and spring (Table 3 ). However, no season variation was shown for HAdV-C infections in this study.

The phylogenetic tree was built based on alignment of the nucleotide sequences of the amplicons of HAdV and the relevant prototype sequences from GenBank. Fig 1 and Table 3 show that HAdV-B and HAdV-C were the most prevalent. The strains isolated from Northern China were identified as HAdV-3 (n = 10) and HAdV-7 (n = 24), belonging to HAdV-B; HAdV-1 (n = 6), HAdV-2 (n = 1), HAdV-5 (n = 2), HAdV-6 (n = 2) and HAdV-57 (n = 1), belonging to HAdV-C; and HAdV-37 (n = 1), belonging to HAdV-D( Table 4 ). The genotypes of most HAdV isolates were identified by alignment to those prototypes from GenBank, with the exception of isolates KM377988, KM377996, KM378012, KM378034, and KM378038, which formed a single separate cluster compared to prototypes HAdV-2 and HAdV-6. HAdV-37 and HAdV-57 were also detected in respiratory specimens, which were reported as the pathogens of keratoconjunctivitis and gastrointestinal, respectively. In contrast, HAdV-C was predominant among the strains from Eastern China with HAdV-1 (n = 5), HAdV-2 (n = 8), HAdV-5 (n = 6), and HAdV-6 (n = 1), whereas HAdV-B also contained several strains from Eastern China with HAdV-3 (n = 2) and HAdV-7 (n = 1), and HAdV-4 (HAdV-E). Table 5 , which indicated that dominant types for single HAdV infection was HAdV-7 (3 cases), HAdV-1 (3 cases) and HAdV-2 (2 cases). Based on the analysis of clinical records, the clinical manifestation of the patients with HAdV infection included fever, cough, and sputum. A few cases showed signs of a runny nose, nasal congestion, and gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting (Table 5) . Because the prevalence of co-infection of HAdV with other viruses is higher than that of HAdV infection alone, it is difficult to associate the clinical profiles with HAdV infection or specific types.

Among the seven recognised HAdV species (HAdV-A to G), HAdV-B (particularly HAdV-3, HAdV-7, HAdV-11, HAdV-14, HAdV-21) and E (HAdV-4) have more often been associated with epidemic ARI [4-6, 12-15, 19] . Rapid detection of these viruses would enhance the outbreak response. We reported the prevalence of multiple HAdV types (HAdV-B, HAdV-C, HAdV-D HAdV-E) in paediatric patients with SARI in China from 2007 to 2010 (overlapping the H1N1 pandemic period). Consistent with previous reports [6, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , the HAdV-B and HAdV-C were the most common serotypes for ARI, and co-infection with other respiratory viruses was frequent (64 from 76, especially co-infection with RSV, HRV, HBoV and PIV3). And 32 from 76 were co-infected by two or more viruses. The previous studies on co-infection with other respiratory viruses of HAdV were limited. Our data showed the higher number of co-infection might be resulted from samples (from the severe paediatric patients) and method (molecular detection for multiple viruses, optimized SOP. . ..). Because of the high co-infection The severity of infection associated with HAdV varies depending on the different HAdV types [10, 15] . In addition, the prevalence of different HAdV serotypes varies among different geographical regions [12] [13] [14] [15] . Our study indicated that HAdV was frequently detected in SARI children from 2008 to 2010 (52/259, 20.1%) in Northern China; this frequency was higher than that of cases in Eastern China (24/293, 8.2% ) and in other studies [10] [11] [12] 19] . The reasons for the marked differences are unknown. We suggest that the cause may be the difference in species of the sample as well as the disease severity in the population studied. However, further investigation is needed. Furthermore, among the 76 HAdV samples, 25 (32.9%) were identified as HAdV-7 (HAdV-B), and 15 (19.7%) as HAdV-3 (HAdV-B) , representing the most common molecular types. Previous studies have found that HAdV-B was the most common species in southern China [26] , and HAdV-3 was the predominant type of HAdV-B. And another study reported HAdV-3 (HAdV-B) outbreak associated with febrile respiratory disease in Eastern China in 2011 [27] . In the present study the most dominant HAdV-C strains were HAdV-1 (11, 14.47%), followed by HAdV-2 (9, 11.84%), and HAdV-5 (8, 10.52%). Other HAdV-C types including HAdV-6, HAdV-2/6 and HAdV-57, as well as HAdV-D (HAdV-37) and

HAdV-E (HAdV-4) types were also observed.

Recombination is a well-known feature of adenovirus genetics [28, 29] . It typically occurs only between strains of the same species [29] ; interspecies recombinants are uncommon [20] . It is noteworthy that we found a peculiar HAdV-2/6 cluster in the present study, likely the recombinants of HAdV-2 and HAdV-6. We have amplified the full hexon from one of HAdV-2/ 6 recombinants (GenBank accession No. KP696777). Its position on the phylogenetic tree indicated that the intertypic (HAdV-2/6) recombination occurred in the second half of the hexon gene (data not shown). However, confirmation of this event requires the sequencing of the complete genome.

Previous reports have indicated that HAdV-37 was associated with epidemic keratoconjunctivitis [30, 31] , and HAdV-57 was isolated from stool specimens of healthy or gastroenteritis-affected children [4, 32] . Surprisingly, we found HAdV-37 (KM378014) and HAdV-57 (KM377992) each in single respiratory samples of inpatient children with SARI, suggesting that they may not be limited to the conjunctiva and the gastrointestinal tract.

In conclusion, the present study reported the circulating HAdV types and their prevalence in paediatric patients with SARI in China. HAdV was frequently (76/552, 13.77%) detected, and HAdV-B and HAdV-C were the most predominant in Northern and Eastern China, respectively. However, we only amplified relatively conserved partial hexon sequences rather than the hypervariable region (HVR), perhaps resulting in the loss of the recombinant and variant information. More extensive studies will be needed to address the prevalence and geographic distribution of dominant genotypes of HAdV using well-matched control groups and sequential samples collected over a longer time. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, HAdV-37 (KM378014) and HAdV-57 (KM377992) are the first strains of these genotypes to be reported in inpatient children with SARI.

Immunization with a Recombinant Vaccinia Virus That Encodes Nonstructural Proteins of the Hepatitis C Virus Suppresses Viral Protein Levels in Mouse Liver

Chronic hepatitis C, which is caused by infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), is a global health problem. Using a mouse model of hepatitis C, we examined the therapeutic effects of a recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) that encodes an HCV protein. We generated immunocompetent mice that each expressed multiple HCV proteins via a Cre/loxP switching system and established several distinct attenuated rVV strains. The HCV core protein was expressed consistently in the liver after polyinosinic acid-polycytidylic acid injection, and these mice showed chronic hepatitis C-related pathological findings (hepatocyte abnormalities, accumulation of glycogen, steatosis), liver fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Immunization with one rVV strain (rVV-N25), which encoded nonstructural HCV proteins, suppressed serum inflammatory cytokine levels and alleviated the symptoms of pathological chronic hepatitis C within 7 days after injection. Furthermore, HCV protein levels in liver tissue also decreased in a CD4 and CD8 T-cell-dependent manner. Consistent with these results, we showed that rVV-N25 immunization induced a robust CD8 T-cell immune response that was specific to the HCV nonstructural protein 2. We also demonstrated that the onset of chronic hepatitis in CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice was mainly attributable to inflammatory cytokines, (tumor necrosis factor) TNF-a and (interleukin) IL-6. Thus, our generated mice model should be useful for further investigation of the immunological processes associated with persistent expression of HCV proteins because these mice had not developed immune tolerance to the HCV antigen. In addition, we propose that rVV-N25 could be developed as an effective therapeutic vaccine.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major public health problem; approximately 170 million people are infected with HCV worldwide [1] . HCV causes persistent infections that can lead to chronic liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [2] . Antiviral drugs are not highly effective in individuals with a chronic infection; furthermore, an effective vaccine against HVC has not been developed. A convenient animal model of HCV infection will greatly facilitate the development of an effective HCV vaccine.

Transgenic mice that express HCV proteins have been generated to study HCV expression [3, 4] ; however, in each of these cases, the relevant transgenes is expressed during embryonic development; therefore, the transgenic mice become immunotolerant to the transgenic products, and consequently, the adult mice are not useful for investigations of the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis C. To address this problem, we developed a system that can drive conditional expression of an HCV transgene; our system involves the Cre/loxP system and a recombinant adenovirus capable of expressing Cre recombinase [5, 6] . Concerns have been expressed that an adenovirus and transient expression of HCV proteins could induce immune responses [5] and, therefore, obscure any evidence of the effect of the host immune responses on chronic liver pathology. Therefore, here, we used a Cre/loxP switching system to generate an immunocompetent mouse model of HCV protein expression; with this system, we could study the host immune responses against HCV proteins. Folgori et al. (2006) reported effective vaccination of chimpanzees with an adenoviral vector and plasmid DNA encoding the HCV nonstructural region. This technique protected the liver tissues from acute hepatitis, which results when whole animals are challenged with virus [7] . However, this vaccine has not yet been shown to be effective against chronic HCV infection.

Here, we aimed to address how HCV expression causes chronic liver diseases and to provide new options for HCV vaccine development. Using LC16m8, a highly attenuated strain of vaccinia virus (VV), we generated three recombinant vaccinia viruses (rVVs) that each encoded one of three different HCV proteins and found that one recombinant virus (rVV-N25), which encoded nonstructural HCV proteins, resolved pathological chronic hepatitis C symptoms in the liver. We also found that immunization with rVV-N25 suppressed HCV core protein levels in the livers of transgenic mice; moreover, this suppression was mediated by CD4 and CD8 T cells, as has been previously reported [8] .

To produce adult mice that express an HCV transgene, we bred CN2-29 transgenic mice, which carry an HCV transgene, [5, 6, 9] with Mx1-Cre transgenic mice [10] , which express Cre recombinase in response to interferon (IFN)-a or a chemical inducer of IFN-a, poly(I:C) ( Figure 1A ). Following poly(I:C) injection, the HCV transgene was rearranged, and HCV sequences were expressed in the livers of F1 progeny (CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice) within 7 days after poly(I:C) injection ( Figure 1B) .

To evaluate the characteristic features of these CN2-29 (+/2) / MxCre (+/2) mice, we analyzed serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and liver HCV core protein levels after poly(I:C) injection. As illustrated in Figure 1C , serum ALT levels increased and reached a peak at 24 h after the first poly(I:C) injection; this elevation appeared to be a direct result of the poly(I:C) treatment, which causes liver injury [11] . After this peak, serum ALT levels dropped continuously until day 4, and then ALT levels began to increase, as did HCV core protein levels. Thereafter, the HCV core protein was expressed consistently for at least 600 days.

Histological analysis showed HCV core protein expression in most hepatocytes of the transgenic mice; these mice showed evidence of lymphocytic infiltration that was caused by the HCV core proteins ( Figure 1D and E). These observations, in addition to the modified histology activity index (HAI) scores, indicated that expression of HCV proteins caused chronic hepatitis in the CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice because a weak, though persistent, immune response followed an initial bout of acute hepatitis ( Figure  S1 ). Moreover, we observed a number of other pathological changes in these mice -including swelling of hepatocytes, abnormal architecture of liver-cell cords, abnormal accumulation of glycogen, steatosis, fibrosis, and HCC (Figures 1E and F, Table  S1 ). Steatosis was mild in the younger mice (day 21) and became increasingly severe over time (days 120 and 180; Figure S2 ). Importantly, none of the pathological changes were observed in the CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (2/2) mice after poly(I:C) injection ( Figure 1F ).

To determine whether activation of the host immune response caused the reduction with HCV protein levels in the livers of CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice, we used a highly attenuated VV strain, LC16m8, to generate three rVVs [12] . Each rVV encoded a different HCV protein; rVV-CN2 encoded mainly structural proteins, rVV-N25 encoded nonstructural proteins, and rVV-CN5 encoded the entire HCV protein region (Figure 2A ). Because rVVs can express a variety of proteins and induce strong and long-term immunity, they have been evaluated as potential prophylactic vaccines [13] .

We used western blots to confirm that each HCV protein was expressed in cell lines. Each of seven proteins -the core, E1, E2, NS3-4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B -was recognized and labeled by a separate cognate antibody directed ( Figure S3 ). To induce effective immune responses against HCV proteins in transgenic mice, we injected an rVV-HCV (rVV-CN2, rVV-CN5, or rVV-N25) or LC16m8 (as the control) intradermally into CN2-29 (+/2) / MxCre (+/2) mice 90 days after poly(I:C) injection ( Figure 2B ). Analysis of liver sections 7 days after immunization with rVV-N25 revealed dramatic improvement in a variety of pathological findings associated with chronic hepatitis -including piecemeal necrosis, hepatocyte swelling, abnormal architecture of liver-cell cords, abnormal accumulation of glycogen, and steatosis ( Figures 2C-E) . Collectively, these results demonstrated that only the rVV-N25 treatment resulted in histological changes indicative of improvement in the chronic hepatitis suffered by the transgenic mice.

To determine whether rVV-N25 treatment induced the same effect in other strains of HCV transgenic mice, we analyzed RzCN5-15 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice, which express all HCV proteins; in these mice, chronic hepatitis was resolved within 28 days of immunization with rVV-N25. Taken together, these findings indicated that rVV-N25 had a dramatic therapeutic effect on both types of HCV transgenic mice ( Figure S4 ).

To assess in detail the effects of rVV-HCV immunization on HCV protein clearance from the livers of CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/ 2) mice, we monitored the levels of HCV core protein in liver samples via ELISA. We found that within 28 days after immunization the HCV core protein levels were significantly lower in livers of rVV-N25-treated mice than in those of control mice ( Figure 3A ). Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that, within 28 days after immunization, levels of HCV core protein were substantially lower in the livers of CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice than in those of control mice ( Figure 3B ). Importantly, neither resolution of chronic hepatitis nor reduction in the HCV protein levels was observed in the mice treated with LC16m8, rVV-CN2, or rVV-CN5. These results indicated that HCV nonstructural proteins might be important for effects of therapeutic vaccines. In contrast, rVV-CN5 which encoded HCV structural and non-structural proteins did not show any significant effects. These results indicated that HCV structural proteins might have inhibited the therapeutic effects of the non-structural proteins. Therefore, it may be important to exclude the HCV structural proteins (aa 1-541) as antigenic proteins when developing therapeutic vaccines against chronic hepatitis C.

In addition, we measured serum ALT levels in CN2-29 (+/2) / MxCre (+/2) mice from all four treatment groups 28 days after rVV-HCV immunization.

We observed steatosis (oil-red-O staining) on day 180 and, subsequently, fibrosis (Azan staining) on day 480. The scale bars indicate 50 mm. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0051656.g001 ly different in the rVV-N25-treated mice and control mice ( Figure 3C ); this finding indicated that rVV-N25 treatment did not cause liver injury and that the antiviral effect was independent of hepatocyte destruction.

We hypothesized that the reduction in the levels of HCV core protein in rVV-HCV-treated mice was not caused by cytolytic elimination of hepatocytes that expressed HCV proteins. To investigate this hypothesis, we conducted an RTD-PCR analysis of genomic DNA from liver samples of CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice. The recombined transgene was similar in rVV-N25-treated and control mice 28 days after immunization ( Figure 3D ). We also measured the expression of HCV mRNA in LC16m8-treated CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice with that in rVV-N25-treated CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice 28 days after immunization; the HCV mRNA levels did not differ between rVV-N25-treated CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) and control mice ( Figure 3E ). These results indicated that rVV-N25-induced suppression of HCV core protein expression could be controlled at a posttranscriptional level.

Viral clearance is usually associated with CD4 and CD8 T-cell activity that is regulated by cytolytic or noncytolytic antiviral mechanism [14] . To determine whether CD4 or CD8 T-cell activity was required for the reduction in HCV core protein levels in the livers of transgenic mice, we analyzed the core protein levels in CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice immunized with rVV-N25 in the absence of CD4 or CD8 T cells ( Figure 4A ). As expected, the mice lacking CD4 or CD8 T cells failed to show a reduction in HCV core protein levels ( Figure 4B ).

However, in mice lacking either CD4 or CD8 T-cells, the pathological changes associated with chronic hepatitis were resolved following rVV-N25 immunization, and the steatosis score of rVV-N25-treated mice was significantly lower than that of control mice (Figures 4C-E) . These results indicated that CD4 and CD8 T cells were not responsible for the rVV-N25-induced amelioration of histological findings and that other inflammatory cell types may play an as-yet-unidentified role in the resolution of the pathological changes in these mice.

Because we found that HCV protein reduction in the liver required CD8 T cells, we tested whether HCV-specific CD8 T cells were present in splenocytes 28 days after immunization. To determine the functional reactivity of HCV-specific CD8 + T cells, we performed a CD107a mobilization assay and intracellular IFNc staining. CN2-29 transgenic mice expressed the HCV structural protein and the NS2 region. However, rVV-N25 comprised only Isolated splenocytes from immunized mice were co-cultured with EL-4CN2 or EL-4NS2 cell lines for 2 weeks and analyzed.

Cytolytic cell activation can be measured using CD107a, a marker of degranulation [15] . The ratio of CD8 + CD107a + cells to all CD8 T cells significantly increased in rVV-N25-treated splenocytes after co-culture with EL-4CN2 or EL-4NS2 (P,0.05), whereas splenocytes that had been treated with any other rVV were not detected ( Figure 5A, B and C) . These results indicated that rVV-N25 treatment increased the frequency of HCV NS2specific activated CD8 T cells. Consistent with these results, the ratio of CD8 + IFN-c + cells to all CD8 T cells for rVV-N25-treated mice was also significantly higher than that for mice treated with any other rVV (P,0.05). Taken together, these findings indicated that rVV-N25 induced an effective CD8 T-cell immune response and that NS2 is an important epitope for CD8 T cells.

To determine whether rVV-N25 treatment affected inflammatory cytokine production, we measured serum levels of inflammatory cytokines after rVV immunization. The serum levels of these inflammatory cytokines increased in the CN2-29 (+/2) / MxCre (+/2) mice ( Figure 6A, Figure S5 ). Immunization with rVV-N25 affected serum levels of inflammatory cytokines in CN2-29 (+/ 2) /MxCre (+/2) mice and caused a return to the cytokine levels observed in wild-type untreated mice ( Figure 6A ). In wild-type mice, the cytokine levels remained unchanged after immunization ( Figure 6A ). These results indicated that inflammatory cytokines were responsible for liver pathogenesis in the transgenic mice.

To test the hypothesis that inflammatory cytokines were responsible for liver pathogenesis in CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice, we administered transgenic mouse serum intravenously into nontransgenic mice. We observed the development of chronic hepatitis in the nontransgenic mice within 7 days after the serum transfer ( Figures 6B and C) . This finding was consistent with the 28 days after immunization with LC16m8 or rVV-N25. The scale bars indicate 100 mm (C) and 50 mm (D). (E) Histological evaluation of steatosis in liver samples from CD4-depleted or CD8-depleted CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice 28 days after immunization with LC16m8 or rVV-N25. Significant relationships are indicated by a P-value. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0051656.g004 hypothesis that inflammatory mediators played a key role in inducing hepatitis. Furthermore, to investigate whether TNF-a and IL-6 played particularly critical roles in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis in the transgenic mice, we neutralized TNF-a and blocked the IL-6 receptor in the livers of these mice. As expected, chronic hepatitis did not develop in these mice. (Figure 6D and E) .

Next, to determine which cell population(s) produced TNF-a, IL-6, or both during continuous HCV expression in CN2-29 (+/2) / MxCre (+/2) mice, we isolated intrahepatic lymphocytes (IHLs) and labeled the macrophages (the F4/80 + cells) with anti-TNF-a and anti-IL-6 antibodies using an intracellular cytokine detection method. Macrophages in CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (2/2) mice produced small amounts of TNF-a and IL-6, while those in CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice produced much larger amounts of these cytokines ( Figure 6F ).

Finally, we evaluated whether rVV-N25 treatment affected the number of macrophages, cytokine production by macrophages, or both; specifically, we isolated IHLs from CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice 7 days after immunization with rVV-N25 or with LC16m8. The percentage of macrophages (CD11b + F4/80 + ) among IHLs and IL-6 production from these macrophages were significantly lower in rVV-N25-treated mice than in control mice ( Figure 6G ). Though the percentage of TNF-a-producing macrophages was not significantly different in rVV-N25-treated and control mice (P = 0.099), rVV-N25 treatment appeared to suppress these macrophages. These results demonstrated that rVV-N25 had a suppressive effect on activated macrophages, and they indicated that this suppression ameliorated the histological indicators of chronic hepatitis.

Various HCV transgenic mouse models have been developed and used to examine immune response to HCV expression and the effects of pathogenic HCV protein on hepatocytes [4, 16, 17] . However, these transgenic mice develop tolerance to the HCV protein; therefore, examining immune response to HCV protein has been difficult.

To overcome the problem of immune tolerance in mouse models of HCV expression, we developed an HCV model in mice that relies on conditional expression of the core, E1, E2, and NS2 proteins and the Cre/loxP switching system [5, 6] ; we showed that the injection of an Ad-Cre vector enhanced the frequency of HCV-specific activated CD8 T cells in the liver of these mice and caused liver injury. However, the Ad-Cre adenovirus vector alone causes acute hepatitis in wild-type mice. Nevertheless, the transgenic model was useful for evaluating interactions between the host immune system and viral protein (serum ALT level over 2,000 IU/L) [5] ; HCV core protein levels were reduced and expression of this protein was transient (about 2 weeks). Therefore, this Ad-Cre-dependent model cannot be used to effectively investigate immune responses to chronic HCV hepatitis.

Here, we used poly (I:C)-induced expression of Cre recombinase to generate HCV transgenic mice in order to study the effect of HCV protein and confirmed that these mice developed chronic active hepatitis-including steatosis, lipid deposition, and hepatocellular carcinoma. These pathological findings in the transgenic mice were very similar to those in humans with chronic hepatitis C; therefore, this mouse model of HCV may be useful for analyzing the immune response to chronic hepatitis. However, experimental results obtained with this mouse model may not directly translate to clinical findings from patients with HCV infection because the expression of HCV proteins was not liver specific in these mice. Furthermore, poly(I:C) injection can activate innate immune responses and, consequently, might induce temporary liver injury [18] . Additionally, poly(I:C) injection has an adjuvant effect; specifically, it stimulates TLR3 signaling [19] .

To evaluate whether poly(I:C) injection caused hepatitis in CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (2/2) mice, we examined serum ALT levels and liver histology following poly(I:C) injection. We found that, following poly(I:C) injection, serum ALT levels in CN2-29 (+/2) / MxCre (2/2) mice increased, reached a peak one day after injection, declined from day 1 to day 6, and were not elevated thereafter; this time-course indicated that poly(I:C) injection alone did not induced continuous liver injury ( figure S6 ). Based on these findings, we believe that the effects of poly(I:C) injection in these mice did not confound our analysis of chronic hepatitis.

Immunization with rVV-N25 suppressed HCV protein levels in the liver, and this suppression was associated with ameliorated pathological chronic hepatitis findings (see Figure 3 ). Importantly, rVV-N25 treatment did not cause liver injury based on the serum ALT levels; therefore, this treatment was unlikely to have cytopathic effects on infected hepatocytes. These findings provided strong evidence that rVV-N25 treatment effectively halted the progression of chronic hepatitis. Immunization with plasmid DNA or with recombinant vaccinia virus can effectively induce cellular and humoral immune responses and exert a protective effect against challenge with HCV infection [20, 21] . However, findings from these previous studies revealed HCV immunization of both uninfected, naïve animals and immune-tolerant animals induced a HCV-specific immune response. In the model describe here; the animals were immune competent for HCV; therefore, our findings provided further important evidence that rVV-N25 was effective in the treatment of chronic hepatitis.

In addition, we demonstrated that rVV-N25 treatment in the absence of CD4 and CD8 T cells had no effect on HCV clearance. This important observation indicated that rVV-N25-induced HCV clearance was mediated by CD4 and CD8 T cells. Many studies have shown that spontaneous viral clearance during acute HCV infection is characterized by a vigorous, broadly reactive CD4 and CD8 T-cell response. [8, 22] HCV clearance and hepatocellular cytotoxicity are both mediated by CD8 antigenspecific (cytotoxic T lymphocyte) CTLs [23] . Consistent with these observations, rVV-N25 treatment effectively induced the accumulation of NS2-specific CD8 T cells, which express high levels of Figure 6 . Immunization with rVV-N25 suppresses serum inflammatory cytokine levels.

CD107a and IFN-cin the spleen. Notably, even with rVV-N25 immunization, the frequency of activated CD8 T cells was very low, and a minimum of 2-weeks incubation was required to distinguish the difference between rVV treatments. Even if a small population of specific CD8+ T cells played a relevant role in the reduction of core protein, it is difficult to assert that the only NS2specific CD8+ T cells were important to this reduction. However, based on the results presented in Figure 4B , we are able to conclude that at least CD8+ and/or CD4+ T cells were important to the reduction in HCV core protein. Therefore, to elucidate the mechanism of HCV protein clearance, further investigation of not only the other T cell epitopes but also other immunocompetent cells is required.

Interestingly, rVV-N25 treatment-but not the rVV-CN2 or rVV-CN5 treatment-efficiently induced a HCV-specific activated CD8 T cells response; this difference in efficacy could have one or more possible causes. The HCV structural proteins (core, E1, and E2 proteins) in the rVV-CN construct may cause the difference; Saito et al. reported that injection with plasmid constructs encoding the core protein induced a specific CTL response in BALB/c mice [24] . Reportedly, CTL activity against core or envelope protein is completely absent from transgenic mice immunized with a plasmid encoding the HCV structural proteins, but core-specific CTL activity is present in transgenic mice that were immunized with a plasmid encoding the HCV core [21] . In contrast, when recombinant vaccinia virus expressing different regions of the HCV polyprotein were injected into BALB/c mice, only the HCV core protein markedly suppressed vaccinia-specific CTL responses [25] . Thus, the HCV core protein may have an immunomodulatory function [26] . Based on these reports and our results, we hypothesize that the causes underlying the effectiveness of rVV-N25 treatment were as follows: 1) this rVV construct included the core and envelope proteins and 2) the core protein had an immune-suppressive effect on CTL induction. Therefore, we suggest that exclusion of the core and envelope antigen as immunogen is one important factor in HCV vaccine design.

Interestingly, immunization with rVV-N25 rapidly suppressed the inflammatory response; however, immunization with either of the other rVVs did not (see Figure 6A ). This result indicated that rVV-N25 may modulate inflammation via innate immunity, as well as via acquired immunity. Reportedly, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent recognition pathways play a role in the recognition of poxviruses [27] . TLR2 and TLR9 have also been implicated in the recognition of the vaccinia virus [28, 29] . These findings indicate that TLR on dendritic cells may modulate the immunosuppressive effect of rVV-N25 in our model of HCV infection; however, further examination of this hypothesis is required. The finding that pathological symptoms in the HCV transgenic mice were completely blocked by intravenous injection of TNF-a and IL-6 neutralizing antibodies indicated that the progression of chronic hepatitis depended on inflammatory cytokines in serum, rather than the HCV protein levels in hepatocytes. Lymphocytes, macrophages, hepatocytes, and adipocytes each produce TNF-a and IL-6 [30, 31] , and HCV-infected patients have elevated levels of TNF-a and IL-6 [32, 33] . Both cytokines also contribute to the maintenance of hepatosteatosis in mice fed a high-fat diet [34] , and production of TNF-a and IL-6 is elevated in obese mice due to the low grade inflammatory response that is caused by lipid accumulation [35] . These findings indicate that both cytokines are responsible for HCV-triggered hepatosteatosis, and anti-cytokine neutralization is a potential treatment for chronic hepatitis if antiviral therapy is not successful.

The reduction of macrophages in number might be due to the induction of apoptosis by vaccinia virus in vitro infection as previous reported [36] . To understand the mechanisms responsible for the reduction of the number of macrophage, we performed another experiment to confirm whether the macrophages were infected with vaccinia virus inoculation. However, based on PCR analyses; vaccinia virus DNA was not present in liver tissue that contained macrophages ( Figure S7 ). Furthermore, apoptosis of macrophages was not detected in liver samples (Data not shown). Based on these results, it is unlikely that the reduction in the number of macrophages was due to apoptosis induced by vaccinia virus infection. Although rVV-N25 reduced the number of macrophage, precise mechanism is still unknown. Further examination to elucidate the mechanism is required.

In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that rVV-N25 is a promising candidate for an HCV vaccine therapy. Additionally, the findings of this study indicate that rVV-N25 immunization can be used for prevention of HCV infection and as an antiviral therapy against ongoing HCV infection. 

R6CN2 HCV cDNA (nt 294-3435) [37] and full genomic HCV cDNA (nt 1-9611) [38, 39] were cloned from a blood sample taken from a patient (#R6) with chronic active hepatitis (Text S1). The infectious titer of this blood sample has been previously reported [40] . R6CN2HCV and R6CN5HCV transgenic mice were bred with Mx1-Cre transgenic mice (purchased from Jackson Laboratory) to produce R6CN2HCV-MxCre and R6CN5HCV-MxCre transgenic mice, which were designated CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) and RzCN5-15 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice, respectively. Cre expression in the livers of these mice was induced by intraperitoneal injection of polyinosinic acid-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] (GE Healthcare UK Ltd., Buckinghamshire, England); 300 mL of a poly(I:C) solution (1 mg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) was injected three times at 48-h intervals. All animal care and experimental procedures were performed according to the guidelines established by the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science Subcommittee on Laboratory Animal Care.

Tissue samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, embedded in paraffin, sectioned (4-mm thickness), and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Staining with periodic acid-Schiff stain, Azan stain, silver, or Oil-red-O was also performed to visualize glycogen degeneration, fibrillization, reticular fiber degeneration, or lipid degeneration, respectively.

For immunohistochemical staining, unfixed frozen liver sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and then incubated with blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the sections were incubated with biotinylated mouse anti-HCV core mono-clonal antibody (5E3) for 2 h at room temperature. After being washed with PBS, the sections were incubated with streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen). The nuclei were stained with 4',6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Fluorescence was observed using a confocal laser microscope (Laser scanning microscope 510, Carl Zeiss).

The pBR322-based plasmid vector pBMSF7C contained the ATI/p7.5 hybrid promoter within the hemagglutinin gene region of the vaccinia virus, which was reconstructed from the pSFJ1-10 plasmid and pBM vector [41, 42] . Separate full-length cDNAs encoding either the HCV structural protein, nonstructural protein, or all HCV proteins were cloned from HCV R6 strain (genotype 1b) RNA by RT-PCR. Each cDNA was inserted into a separate pBMSF7C vector downstream of the pBMSF7C ATI/p7.5 hybrid promoter; the final designation of each recombinant plasmid was pBMSF7C-CN2, pBMSF7C-N25, or pBMSF-CN5 (Figure 2 ). They were then transfected into primary rabbit kidney cells infected with LC16m8 (multiplicity of infection = 10). The viruscell mixture was harvested 24 h after the initial transfection by scrapping; the mixture was then frozen at 280uC until use. The hemagglutinin-negative recombinant viruses were cloned as previously described [42] and named rVV-CN2, rVV-N25, or rVV-CN5. Insertion of the HCV protein genes into the LC16m8 genome was confirmed by direct PCR, and expression of each protein from the recombinant viruses was confirmed by western blot analysis. The titers of rVV-CN2, rVV-N25, and rVV-CN5 were determined using a standard plaque assay and RK13 cells.

Data are shown as mean 6 SD. Data were analyzed using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis tests or AN-OVA as appropriate; GraphPad Prism 5 for Macintosh (Graph-Pad) was used for all analyses. P values ,0.05 were considered statistically significant. Table S1 Incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in male and female transgenic mice at 360, 480, and 600 days after poly(I:C) injection.

Ultra-Deep Sequencing of Intra-host Rabies Virus Populations during Cross-species Transmission

One of the hurdles to understanding the role of viral quasispecies in RNA virus cross-species transmission (CST) events is the need to analyze a densely sampled outbreak using deep sequencing in order to measure the amount of mutation occurring on a small time scale. In 2009, the California Department of Public Health reported a dramatic increase (.350%) in the number of gray foxes infected with a rabies virus variant for which striped skunks serve as a reservoir host in Humboldt County. To better understand the evolution of rabies, deep-sequencing was applied to 40 unpassaged rabies virus samples from the Humboldt outbreak. For each sample, approximately 11 kb of the 12 kb genome was amplified and sequenced using the Illumina platform. Average coverage was 17,4486and this allowed characterization of the rabies virus population present in each sample at unprecedented depths. Phylogenetic analysis of the consensus sequence data demonstrated that samples clustered according to date (1995 vs. 2009) and geographic location (northern vs. southern). A single amino acid change in the G protein distinguished a subset of northern foxes from a haplotype present in both foxes and skunks, suggesting this mutation may have played a role in the observed increased transmission among foxes in this region. Deepsequencing data indicated that many genetic changes associated with the CST event occurred prior to 2009 since several nonsynonymous mutations that were present in the consensus sequences of skunk and fox rabies samples obtained from 2003-2010 were present at the sub-consensus level (as rare variants in the viral population) in skunk and fox samples from 1995. These results suggest that analysis of rare variants within a viral population may yield clues to ancestral genomes and identify rare variants that have the potential to be selected for if environment conditions change.

Rabies virus (RABV) is one of the most deadly pathogens known and is able to infect a wide variety of mammalian hosts. RABV is present on all continents except for Antarctica and has reservoirs in terrestrial species as well as bats (Chiroptera). Although vaccination and antibody therapy is effective in treating known exposures to RABV, an estimated 55,000 human deaths occur annually mostly in developing countries [1] . RABV is a member of the Lyssavirus genus, family Rhabdoviridae. The genome is composed of negative-sense single-stranded RNA, about 12 kb in size which codes for five proteins-nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G) and polymerase (L). Like other RNA viruses, RABV has a high mutation rate due to the high error rate of the polymerase, thus populations of RABV exist as a mutant swarm, or quasispecies [2] . RABV evolution is believed to be driven predominantly by purifying selection and RABV is not known to recombine [3] [4] [5] [6] .

Different RABV variants are associated with different reservoir hosts and geographical locations. Typically, interspecies transmission of rabies virus from reservoir to non-reservoir host produces a single fatal spillover event; secondary transmission has rarely been observed [7] . For example, a bat variant may infect and cause disease in skunks, but it does not transmit efficiently within the skunk population and skunks would be considered a ''dead-end host'' for this variant. The exception to this would be the case of cross-species transmission (CST) where the variant from one species adapts to transmission by a new species [8] . For example, in 2001, bat variant rabies adapted to transmission within the skunk population in Flagstaff Arizona [9] , and in 2009 this variant adapted to transmission by foxes [7] . These events demonstrate the capacity of rabies virus for CST which may lead to increased exposure of humans to the pathogen and increase the geographical range of the virus.

Greater than 90% of North American rabies cases occur in wildlife [7, 9] , and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) serve as the most frequent source of terrestrial rabies cases in California [10] . Rabies in striped skunks was first documented in California in 1899 and skunk rabies has been considered enzootic since the 1950s [11] . The Northern Pacific coast region (which includes Humboldt Co.) is unusual in that this is the only region of CA where large numbers of gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) are known to be infected with the skunk rabies variant [11] .

In 2009, the number of rabid foxes in Humboldt County infected with the CA skunk variant increased 356% from an average of 1-2 per year in the preceding 15 years to 7 in the latter months of 2008 to 38 in 2009 (Annual Reports from California Department of Public Health, Veterinary Public Health Section). In 2009, only 2 skunks were reported rabid in Humboldt County suggesting that rabies infections in foxes had fundamentally shifted from a typical pattern of spillover from skunks to foxes to one resulting from fox-to-fox transmission. The reported numbers underestimate the extent of the outbreak since additional foxes exhibiting unusual or aggressive behavior were euthanized but not tested (S. Chandler, USDA, personal communication). This epizootic of rabies in Northern California raised concerns not only because the primary species involved was gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and not striped skunks which are the terrestrial reservoir species in this region, but also because this led to a significant spike in attacks by rabid animals on humans and their pets [12] .

The apparent sustained fox-to-fox transmission in this outbreak suggests that CST occurred and enabled this epizootic. We hypothesized that molecular changes in the viral genome would be associated with this event. While phylogenetic data support that rabies viruses have jumped species boundaries historically [5] , it is rare and has never been subject to comprehensive genetic analysis at the intra-host population level.

To test our hypothesis and better understand the evolution of rabies, we applied deep-sequencing to 44 unpassaged rabies virus samples from the Humboldt epizootic. Sequence data were generated by two different platforms (Illumina and 454) and by three different commercial services to determine reproducibility. For 40 of the samples, approximately 11 kb of the 12 kb genome was amplified and sequenced using the Illumina platform (the remaining 4 samples were sequenced using the 454 platform only). Average coverage was 17,4486 and this allowed characterization of the rabies virus population present in each sample at unprecedented depths.

The tissue samples used in this study were obtained from the archived collection of California Department of Public Health, Viral and Rickettsial Disease Laboratory (CDPH-VRDL). Gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) displaying symptoms of rabies were submitted for rabies testing in the Humboldt Co. Public Health Laboratory between March 2009 and January 2010. Brain tissue samples that were laboratory confirmed to be infected with rabies virus were forwarded to CDPH-VRDL for genetic characterization. Other earlier skunk and fox tissue samples from Humboldt Co. were also available from the CDPH-VRDL archives. As part of routine rabies surveillance in California, the VRDL genotypes rabies-positive samples received from local public health laboratories by RT-PCR and performs sequence analysis on RT-PCR products using forward primer 1066 deg 59-GARAGAAGATTCTTCAGRGA-39 and reverse primer 304 targeting a portion of the nucleoprotein (N) gene as described in Trimarchi and Smith (2002) and Velasco-Villa, et al. (2006) [13] [14] [15] . Approximately 1 gram of brain tissue from foxes and skunks infected with the California skunk rabies virus variant were placed in TRIzol LS Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sent to LLNL for further analysis. RNA was extracted from the tissue sample following the manufacturer's protocol.

Approximately 11 kb of the 12 kb rabies virus genome was amplified using degenerate primers (Table S1 ). Primers were designed to be as sensitive to target strain variants as possible, while still being specific enough to not cross-react with non-targets. Sensitivity was achieved by targeting regions of high sequence similarity, identified through a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) of the target sequences. Specificity was achieved by targeting regions that do not appear to be similar to any other organisms, determined by searching a database of known genome sequences. Primer candidates were selected based on the combined results of the MSA and sequence searches. This technique is a modified version of the approach outlined in Slezak et. al. [16] , which accommodates degenerate primer design for diverse target genomes, and places a lower relative priority on primer uniqueness as compared to other known genomes. For rabies virus, which lacks perfect primer-length conservation around the genomic regions of interest, it was necessary to identify degenerate primers for many non-conserved primer regions. From the identified primer candidate regions, which included both perfectly conserved regions and degenerate regions, individual primer pairs were selected which provided overlapping coverage of the DNA being sequenced. Final checks were performed which helped avoid hybridization problems such as primer dimerization.

Reverse transcription was performed using random hexamers and the Superscript III RT reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). The rabies virus cDNA templates were amplified using the Phusion polymerase kit (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA), following manufacturer's instructions. PCR conditions consisted of 98uC for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 98uC for 15 s, 64uC for 20 s, and 72uC for 1.2 min. The final cycle was 72uC for 10 min.

A plasmid control was generated to determine the error rate of the PCR and sequencing steps as described previously [17] . PCR products were prepared for sequencing using the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Sequencing of an aliquot of a subset of 40 samples was carried out by Eureka Genomics, Hercules, CA using an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx. Another aliquot of the same samples plus an additional 4 samples were set for 454 sequencing at the Brigham Young University DNA

Understanding the role of genetic variants within a viral population is a necessary step toward predicting and treating emerging infectious diseases. The high mutation rate of RNA viruses increases the ability of these viruses to adapt to diverse hosts and cause new human and zoonotic diseases. The genetic diversity of a viral population within a host may allow the virus to adapt to a diverse array of selective pressures and enable cross-species transmission events. In 2009 a large outbreak of rabies in Northern California involved a skunk rabies virus variant that efficiently transmitted within a population of gray foxes, suggesting possible adaptation to a novel host species. To better understand the evolution of rabies virus that enabled this host jump, we applied deep-sequencing analysis to rabies virus samples from the outbreak. Deepsequencing data indicated that many of the genetic changes associated with host jump occurred prior to 2009, and these mutations were present at very low frequencies in viral populations from samples dating back to 1995. These results suggest deep sequencing is useful for characterization of viral populations, and may provide insight to ancestral genomes and role of rare variants in viral emergence.

Sequencing Center. Sequencing was performed as described previously [17, 18] . For all samples sequenced by Illumina (pairedend read technology), overlapping read pairs (ORPs), generated by combining short fragment libraries with long sequencing reads, was used to reduce sequencing errors and improve rare variant detection accuracy. Quality filtering procedure was also described in [17, 18] .

The open source read mapping software SHRiMP2, which was shown to have high read mapping sensitivity [19] was chosen for the tool's ability to map as many reads as possible in the face of individual errors within each read [20] . All rabies reads were initially mapped to GenBank rabies reference sequence GI:260063801. This reference sequence was used as the common coordinate system for comparing samples and identifying coding frames. Based on a later observation that this newly sequenced rabies virus genome could differ by approximately 9% relative to our selected previously sequenced reference fox rabies sequence, we checked to see if observed error rates would increase by introducing random mutations at 9% of the control reference sequence, however, no noticeable increase in error rates were observed, suggesting that read mapping parameters were able to tolerate this rate of divergence. The Binomial error model defines the expected number of non consensus bases that should occur given the assumed PCR and sequencing error rate for a given number of observed reads, using a preset P-value (set to 0.01 with a Bonferonni correction). Nonconsensus base calls were made when the number of reads with the rare variant exceeded the expected count threshold [17] . The sequencing data used in this study including reads and the analysis files used to make all base calls is available at NCBI's archive BioProject # PRJNA216100.

Data analysis include 44 samples sequenced using 454 across 10,330 genome positions and 40 samples sequenced using Illumina across 10,379 genome positions. The minimum coverage cutoff was 506. After quality filtering, the mean coverage for the sequencing data was 9806 for 454 data and 17,4486 for Illumina ORP data, the median coverage was 7776 for 454 data and 15,7586 for Illumina ORP data (Fig. S1 ). In total, 10,451 positions of the rabies genome were sequenced by either 454 or Illumina, of these, 10330 positions (98.8% of 10,451 loci) were covered by both platforms, though not necessarily for all samples; an additional 36 positions (loci 5199-5206, 5215, 5216, 5218-5220, 5224, 9542-9563) were covered only by 454, and 85 positions (loci 183-267) were covered only by Illumina, also not necessarily for all samples. The few disagreements in consensus base calls between 454 and Illumina were resolved either by taking the base call with far superior coverage or omitting the base call from data analysis entirely. In most cases the disagreement was due to low coverage of the loci by one platform (just above the 506 cutoff) compared to coverage by the other platform (.5006). Hence the final consensus sequences of the two data sets contain no disagreement and can be considered accurate with high confidence.

To differentiate rare variants from sequencing errors, methodologies were developed to measure and control for sequencing and PCR errors and described in Fig. S1 legend [17, 18] . Briefly, all mismatched read pairs in the ORPs were identified as sequencing errors and removed from analysis. Erroneous matching read pairs in the plasmid control were used to estimate the overall PCR error rate [17, 18] . Rates of these two types of errors were then combined in a position-dependent bionomial error model to make variant calls. The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Tamura-Nei model. The tree with the highest log likelihood (-14363.5660) is shown. The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically as follows. When the number of common sites was ,100 or less than one fourth of the total number of sites, the maximum parsimony method was used; otherwise BIONJ method with MCL distance matrix was used. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. The analysis involved 32 nucleotide sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 9669 positions in the final dataset. Bootstrap values (percentage from 500 replications) are shown for the relevant nodes. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5 [28] . Samples in Table S2 ).

Among all 10,451 genome positions sequenced, 243 positions contained more than one consensus nucleotide across the samples, and 4 of these positions showed 3 different consensus nucleotides across the samples. These consensus-level variations across the samples occurred in all five genes of the rabies genome as well as four intergenic regions (Fig. S2 ). The intergenic regions tended have higher rates of consensus-level mutations compared to the 5 genes, with the region between G and L being the most variable (0.06 mutations per nucleotide, Table 1 The intergenic region between G and L remained the most variable, followed by the intergenic region between P and M. The M protein had the highest rate of consensus-level variation across all samples, but the G protein had the highest rate of consensuslevel variation in the outbreak samples.

Consensus sequence reconstruction in the genome coding regions N protein. Sequence data was obtained from amino acid 76 through the end of the N protein coding region. One amino acid substitution, F80L, differentiated the 2003-10 samples from the 1995-96 samples ( Table 2 ). The samples from 2000 also had an F at residue 80 but differed from the other Humboldt samples at residue 106 with D replaced by G. A subset of the 2009-10 samples from southernmost region of the outbreak area and collected early in the outbreak (foxes 5, 2, and 20) had an N to S substitution at site 119. P protein. Phylogenetic analysis grouped samples primarily according to date, with limited grouping according to geography. Only one amino acid change, R30K, differentiated the 2003-10 samples from 1995-96 samples ( Figure S3 ). This residue lies in a conserved region of the protein [21, 22] . The samples from 2000 differed from the 1995-96 at two sites, R86K and E156G, and from the outbreak samples at amino acid 30 with an R at this site rather than a K. Sequence data for the P protein was available for other CA skunk samples in GenBank including one from neighboring Trinity Co. collected in 1997 (V650 CASK); all had an R at site 30, thus the R30K change is unique to the 2003/10 outbreak. , the G open reading frame had low coverage due to difficulty obtaining PCR products for this region ( Figure S1 ). The primers for this project were designed prior to availability of genomic sequence for the CA skunk variant, thus making primer design especially problematic for variable regions of the genome. This likely impacts the number of subconsensus variants detected in this region.

Phylogenetic analysis grouped samples according to date and geography ( Figure 3 ). The sequence data obtained from samples collected between 1995-1996 differed from the 2003-10 samples by four amino acid changes in the G protein; L12Q, D427G, P485L, and S501P, and each involved a change in polarity ( Table 2 ). One amino acid change, G428S, characterized samples obtained from the southern region versus from the northern region. Samples from Arcata were also defined by nucleotide changes and samples from the southern region of Humboldt Co., Loleta, Fortuna, and Hydesville, grouped together as did most of the Eureka samples ( Figure 3 , Figure S5 ). The exceptions were Fx44 from mid Eureka and Fx34 from just east of Eureka, which consistently grouped with the Arcata samples (Figures 1 and 2) . Figure S6 ). Skunk 2 from 1995 differed from all other samples at site 69 where a Y was present rather than an H ( Table 2) .

Reads from the noncoding regions were concatenated and consensus data from 454 and Illumina sequencing were compared (Fig. S7) Figure 5 ).

In general, mutations in the consensus sequence could result either from selection for de novo mutations that occurred during host infection, or enrichment of sub-consensus variants that originated from the transmitting host. Since it is difficult to determine de novo mutations without complete sampling of an outbreak, we focused on those consensus mutations that 1) showed inversion between the historical and outbreak samples and 2) led to changes in the amino acids. Historical samples were defined as those collected between 1995 and 2000. Eleven loci were found to have such amino acid inversions, their frequency distributions for the historical and outbreak haplotypes are shown in Figure 5 A and B respectively. Although the frequencies of these two haplotypes sum up to 100% at a given loci in all samples (except for outlier entries colored white indicating no data and black indicating absence of these two haplotypes and presence of a third haplotype), the dominant haplotype tended to be near 100% (values below 100% have a median of 99.86%) and the minor variant had extremely low presence (median 0.15%, therefore could not be visualized if only one heatmap was presented). The outbreak haplotypes (shown in black letters at the bottom of the heatmaps) began as low frequency variants (0.04% to 6.03%) in the historical samples and rose sometime between 2003 and 2009 to become the dominant haplotypes (94%-100%) in most of the outbreak samples (Fig. 5B) ; while the historical haplotypes (shown in red letters in the heatmaps) went from being dominant (98%-100% presence) in the historical samples to low level variants (0.05%-1.95%) in most of the outbreak samples and even completely disappeared in seven of the outbreak samples (Fig. 5A) . These data highlight the dynamic evolution of the rabies genome over time.

Among the 11 inversion loci, 6 were found in G, 2 found M and 1 in each of N, P and L. Two pairs of inversion loci, (4593, 4596) Data from Illumina sequencing were used to test the hypothesis that sub-consensus variants that were later enriched to become consensus could be detected at higher frequencies in the historical samples than those sub-consensus variants that did not. Loci shown in Figure 5 where inversion of the dominant and minor variants occurred between the historical and later samples are referred to as ''inversion sites''. The frequencies of sub-consensus variants at the inversion sites were compared to that of variants at non-inversion sites present in the 1995 samples (but not enriched to the consensus level in the 2003/10 samples) to determine if those variants at inversion sites were present in higher numbers in the pre-outbreak samples. The average frequency of sub-consensus variants at inversion sites was slightly but significantly higher than that of sub-consensus variants at non-inversion sites (p = 0.03, twosample t-test one-tailed). Samples of individuals from relatively early in the outbreak (prior to July1, 2009) had increased likelihood to have the 1995 consensus haplotype detected at the inversion sites as a sub-consensus mutation, although the difference fell short of statistical significance (p = 0.08).

Some amino acid inversion sites were also associated with other parameters such as geographic location. Nonsense mutations generate defective RNAs that may or may not be functional. Stop codon mutations were shown to be maintained within the dengue virus populations, leading to altered viral fitness and thus influencing transmission dynamics [23] . Likewise, it has been shown that human respiratory syncytial virus mutants lacking the G gene are still able to form infectious particles in vitro [24] . Across all samples and genome locations sequenced by Illumina, 5146 variants were detected at 2302 genomic locations, or 22% of the 10451 positions sequenced. The frequency of these variants range from extremely rare (0.02% at Fx5 genome location 2130, high detection sensitivity due to high coverage of .196,0006, see Figure S1 ) to very common (38% at Fx 40 genome location 1021, measured at 32% by 454). The mean frequency of the variant pool is 0.3%, indicating that the bulk of the variants detected are ultra rare. To examine where in the genome mutations are most likely to occur, only those mutations that occur at .1% in a sample or occur in multiple samples with a cumulative frequency .1% are retained for further analysis. There are 248 loci with such high occurrence/frequency variants (''one-percent variants'', Figure  S9 ), their distribution across the coding and non-coding regions of the rabies genome ( Figure S10 ) are very similar to that of the 243 mutations occurring at the consensus level ( Figure S2 ). In fact, 58 of these one-percent variants occur at loci with consensus-level mutations.

Although rabies virus has jumped species multiple times in the past [5, 8, 9, 25] , the event is relatively rare and deep genome sequence analysis has never been applied to examine the role of Table 1 . Consensus-level mutations found in 5 coding and 4 non-coding regions of the rabies genome. Table 2 . Amino acid changes according to genomic position, sample collection date, and location. Outbreak samples from South Humboldt County include those from Hydesville, Fortuna, Loleta, and Eureka. Samples from North Humboldt County include those from Arcata, Trinidad, and Patrick's Point State Park. 1 No sequence data was obtained for the first 76 amino acids of the N gene. 2 Hydesville and Fortuna samples have S residue at this site. 3 Fx 32 has an E residue at this site. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0002555.t002

intra-host viral populations in such an event. Importantly, the rabies outbreak samples collected by the CDPH were accompanied by epidemiologically important documentation such as exact date and location for most of the samples. Additionally the CDPH's ongoing surveillance efforts provided a unique repository of samples for previous rabies host jumping events, which failed to be efficiently transmitted within the gray fox population. Next generation sequencing technology has recently been used to examine viral heterogeneity of rabies genomes present in infected tissues but has not yet been optimized for detection of rare genotypes (less than 1%) [26] . Deep genome sequencing of these recent and past samples allowed us to define the viral mutational dynamics that were associated with a skunk rabies virus variant that efficiently transmitted within a population of gray foxes, suggesting possible adaptation to a novel host species. Historically, the skunk rabies virus variant present in Humboldt Co. has been detected in foxes more frequently than in any other region of the state but not until 2009 has transmission shifted so disproportionally to the fox population [11] . Our data indicate that the outbreak haplotype responsible is able to be transmitted readily by both skunks and foxes since no genetic changes viral sequence differentiated the skunks and the foxes from the epizootic. These results are similar to those from a study describing the genetic changes associated with the Arizona CST events in that the rabies genotype from the donor species (bats) could not be differentiated from that found in the recipient species (skunks or foxes) [8] .

All of the Humboldt samples had an unusual sequence, ETGL, as the final four amino acids at the carboxyl end of G protein. A recent study demonstrated that the last four amino acids in this region impact the virulence of the virus [27] ; if the final sequence is ETRL then the virus is attenuated due to induction of neuronal apoptosis. According to this study, virulent, wild type RABV haplotypes have QTRL as the terminal sequence, and do not cause apoptosis of the host cell. The impact of the ETGL haplotype on viral virulence is unclear, although it did not perceptibly impact virulence in skunks and foxes.

No amino acid changes were unique to the 2003 samples as compared to the 2009/10 outbreak samples from the Eureka area and further south ( Table 2) ; however distinctive nucleotide changes were present in the noncoding and coding regions. Temporal and genetic data indicate that the outbreak began in south Humboldt Co. and spread north to Arcata and three amino acid changes characterized samples from Arcata area and further north ( Table 2) . Whether or not these genetic changes contributed to the explosive increase in fox rabies that occurred primarily in Arcata during 2009 would require further study (Fig. 2) .

It seems likely that a subset of the foxes infected during 2009/10 were part of a fox-to-fox transmission cycle, with limited skunk-tofox transmission occurring as well. This is supported by the fact Although relatively few amino acid changes were associated with the 2003/10 host jump, it is possible that one or more of these changes may have been required for efficient transmission of the virus in the local gray fox population. Despite an extensive search of the rabies virus literature, none of these amino acid changes were described by other studies as being associated with a change in viral phenotype. Transmission studies using reverse genetics are required to identify which genetic changes are responsible for increased transmissibility. Information from this type of analysis may provide important information on the risk of a similar host jump occurring in other regions, including regions where gray foxes overlap with populations of mesocarnivores that have threatened or endangered status.

Both consensus and deep-sequencing data indicate that the haplotype associated with sustained fox-to-fox transmission during the 2009 outbreak occurred prior to 2009 since several nonsynonymous mutations that were present in the consensus sequences of skunk and fox rabies samples obtained from 2003-2010 were present at the sub-consensus level (as rare variants in the viral population) in skunk and fox samples from 1995 ( Figure 5 ). Analysis of the Illumina ultra-deep sequencing data supported the hypothesis that variants that were later enriched to become consensus could be detected at higher frequencies than variants that did not. In particular, all of the mutations that distinguish the 1995/96 haplotype from the 2003/10 haplotype were present as rare variants in Fx 31, the only 2003 sample for which there is deep sequencing Illumina data available. These results suggest that analysis of rare variants within a viral population may yield clues to ancestral haplotypes and identify rare haplotypes that have the potential to be selected for if environment conditions change.

Color bars at the bottom denote locations of the 5 proteins in the rabies genome: N, P, M, G, L (from the left to right). Illumina data was generated using overlapping read pairs (ORP). ORP analysis is a new method that assesses genome position specific sequencing error. The approach uses paired-end sequencing to sequence a single DNA fragment twice. Sequencing is initiated once from each end of the DNA fragment to produce two distinct sequencer reads. In other applications paired-end sequencing uses larger fragment sizes to ensure that each read generated from the same DNA fragment covers different parts of the molecule to recover more of the original fragment. ORP uses shorter DNA fragments and longer read lengths to maximize the number of bases in the DNA fragment, which are sequenced twice. The redundant sequencing means reads with base calls that disagree with their overlapping pair are recognized as errors and are discarded to effectively lower the sequencing error rate. A position specific base call supported by a read pair can still disagree with the consensus base call leading to detection of rare variants. ORPs provide an important benefit over the alternative of adding higher sequencer coverage since the detected mismatches between read pairs give an empirically derived sequencing error rate, which is specific to each sequencer run. shown.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus M protein suppresses type I interferon expression through the inhibition of TBK1-dependent phosphorylation of IRF3

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection has claimed hundreds of lives and has become a global threat since its emergence in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The ability of MERS-CoV to evade the host innate antiviral response may contribute to its severe pathogenesis. Many MERS-CoV-encoded proteins were identified to have interferon (IFN)-antagonizing properties, which correlates well with the reduced IFN levels observed in infected patients and ex vivo models. In this study, we fully characterized the IFN-antagonizing property of the MERS-CoV M protein. Expression of MERS-CoV M protein suppressed type I IFN expression in response to Sendai virus infection or poly(I:C) induction. This suppressive effect was found to be specific for the activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) but not nuclear factor-κB. MERS-CoV M protein interacted with TRAF3 and disrupted TRAF3-TBK1 association leading to reduced IRF3 activation. M proteins from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have three highly similar conserved N-terminal transmembrane domains and a C-terminal region. Using chimeric and truncation mutants, the N-terminal transmembrane domains of the MERS-CoV M protein were found to be sufficient for its inhibitory effect on IFN expression, whereas the C-terminal domain was unable to induce this suppression. Collectively, our findings suggest a common and conserved mechanism through which highly pathogenic MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV harness their M proteins to suppress type I IFN expression at the level of TBK1-dependent phosphorylation and activation of IRF3 resulting in evasion of the host innate antiviral response.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in Saudi Arabia in September 2012 as a novel coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory disease. 1 Since then, this virus has caused recurrent outbreaks in the Arabian Peninsula and has spread, occasionally, to other parts of the world. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] According to the World Health Organization, 1626 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported between September 2012 and 7 January 7 2016 with 586 related deaths in 26 countries. 10 In particular, 186 people were infected and 36 were killed in one recent outbreak in South Korea. 10 MERS-CoV is classified into lineage C of Betacoronavirus and is most phylogenetically related to two bat coronaviruses, HKU4 and HKU5, providing insight on its evolutionary origin. 11, 12 MERS-CoV is a polycistronic positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus with a genome of~30 Kb in size. The 5′ most two-thirds of MERS-CoV genome encodes polyproteins 1a and 1ab, which are further cleaved to yield 16 non-structural proteins, whereas the 3′ end of the genome encodes several structural or lineage-specific proteins. 13 Upon infection, these proteins are expressed to facilitate viral replication and propagation in the host. 14 MERS-CoV infection has been widely reported to mildly induce type I interferons (IFNs), including IFN-α and -β, in patients as well as in animal and cellular infection models. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] This has been attributed to the IFNantagonizing property of some MERS-CoV-encoded proteins, which directly perturb the host IFN production mechanisms, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] lending support to the notion that MERS-CoV uses multiple strategies to evade the innate immune response.

In non-specialized epithelial cells as well as a subset of specialized immune cells that are susceptible to MERS-CoV infection, 16, 18, 27 type I IFN production is an important part of the host innate immune response and is initiated by ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic viral sensors in the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR) family in response to the detection of viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). 28, 29 Stimulated RLRs mobilize downstream signal transducers that lead to the activation of the transcription factors IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) that drive IFN-β expression. 28 The transduction events within this signaling cascade are prone to negative regulation by many MERS-CoV proteins. In a comparative analysis of MERS-CoV structural and accessory proteins, it has been shown that M, ORF4a, ORF4b and ORF5 possess IFN-antagonizing properties. 22 We, and others, have characterized the ORF4a protein as a dsRNA-binding protein that interferes with the activation of RLR by either a dsRNA ligand or the protein co-activator PACT. 24, 25 However, the molecular mechanisms through which other MERS-CoV proteins manipulate the RLR signaling pathway to disrupt IFN-β expression have not been elucidated.

In this study, we focused on the characterization of the MERS-CoV M protein in IFN antagonism. Coronavirus M protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein localized predominantly to the Golgi complex and is required for virion assembly. [30] [31] [32] MERS-CoV M protein is of particular interest because SARS-CoV M protein also inhibits IFN production through a mechanism by which the formation of TRAF3·TANK·TBK1/IKK-ε complex is impeded to ablate the activation of IRF3 transcription factor. 30 In contrast, M protein encoded by human coronavirus HKU1 associated with common cold has no influence on IFN production. 32 Here we reported that the MERS-CoV M protein also specifically inhibited IRF3 activation but not NF-κB signaling. MERS-CoV M protein was capable of interacting with TRAF3 adapter protein and hampered TRAF3-TBK1 interaction leading to diminished IRF3 activation. Using a chimeric protein containing the MERS-CoV M protein N-terminal transmembrane domains and a dormant SARS-CoV M protein C-terminal domain, we confirmed that the N-terminal transmembrane domains of MERS-CoV M protein sufficiently account for its inhibitory effect. Although another chimera containing SARS-CoV M protein N-terminal transmembrane domains and a MERS-CoV M protein C-terminal domain was fully competent in IFN antagonism, a truncation mutant lacking the functional first transmembrane domain of SARS-CoV M was not, suggesting that the C-terminal domain of the MERS-CoV M protein is largely dispensable for its immunosuppressive activity.

The IFNβ-luc reporter plasmid and RIG-I expression plasmid are gifts from Professor Takashi Fujita (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). 28 The expression plasmids for TBK1, IRF3 and TRAF3 were generous gifts from Dr Genhong Cheng (University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA), 33, 34 whereas those for RIG-I N, IKK-ε and MAVS and IκB-α as well as IRF3-luc and κB-luc reporter plasmids have been described elsewhere. 30, [35] [36] [37] Viral RNA was extracted from MERS-CoV-infected Vero-E6 cells. The M gene was PCR-amplified from complementary DNA and cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pCAGEN plasmid with the addition of a C-terminal V5-tag with the following primers: 5′-ATG TCT AAT ATG ACG CAA CTC ACT GA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGC TCG AAG CAA TGC AAG TTC-3′ (reverse). The SARS-CoV M protein expression plasmid has been described elsewhere. 30, 32 The expression plasmids for the SN and MN chimeras were constructed by assembly PCR with the following forward primers covering the breakpoints: 5′-AGG CTG TTT GCT CGT ACC CGC TCA TGG TGG TCA TTC AAT CCT GAG-3′ (SN) and 5′-CCG GCT GTT TAT GAG AAC TGG ATC AAT GTG GTC ATT CAA CCC A-3′ (MN). The reverse primers were complementary to their respective forward primers. The truncation mutant of the SN chimera lacking the first transmembrane domain was constructed using the forward primer: 5′-ATG GTA ACA CTT GCT TGT TTT GTG CT-3′.

Mouse anti-FLAG (M2) and anti-β-actin antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Mouse anti-V5 and anti-HA (Y11) antibodies were purchased from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY, USA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX, USA), respectively. Rabbit anti-IRF3 and anti-phospho-IRF3 (Ser 386) antibodies were purchased from IBL-America (Minneapolis, MN, USA).

Cell culture and Sendai virus HEK-293 human embryonic kidney cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies) at 37°C in a humidified chamber supplemented with 5% carbon dioxide. Plasmid transfection was performed with GeneJuice (Merck Millipore; Billerica, MA, USA). poly(I:C) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and was transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). Sendai virus (Cantell strain) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA).

Dual-luciferase reporter assay, co-immunoprecipitation and western blotting were performed as previously described. 30, 38 Particularly, relative luciferase activity in arbitrary units was calculated by normalizing firefly luciferase activity to Renilla luciferase activity recovered from cell lysate. Non-denaturing native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed as previously described. 36, 39, 40 Bioinformatic analysis Sequence alignment was performed using Cluster Omega, an online tool based on the hidden Markov model, 41 and hosted by the EMBL-EBI server (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/). Transmembrane domain prediction was performed using TMFinder, which considers hydrophobicity and helicity of the amino-acid sequence (http://tmfinder.research.sickkids.ca/). 42 

To characterize the MERS-CoV M protein in terms of its IFN antagonism, M protein was ectopically expressed in cultured cells for functional assays ( Figure 1A) . A luciferase reporter construct driven by IFN-β promoter was used to reflect IFN-β promoter activity stimulated during infection. Sendai virus was used as a model virus to potently induce IFN expression in transfected cells. When increasing doses of M proteins were expressed in advance, a dose-dependent inhibition of IFN-β promoter activity was observed ( Figure 1B ; bars 3-5 compared with bar 2). A similar observation was also noted when synthetic dsRNA analog poly(I:C) was used as an alternative inducer that specifically stimulates the RLR pathway of IFN production ( Figure 1C ; bars 3-5 compared with bar 2). These two pieces of data are generally consistent with a previous report, 22 and they further strengthen the current model of the IFN antagonism of MERS-CoV M protein.

Cellular IFN-β expression is under the control of multiple transcription factors, which work cooperatively to form a large enhanceosome complex. 43 In particular, IRF3 and NF-κB are two transcription factors that are primarily activated by RLR signaling. 28, 44, 45 MERS-CoV M protein has previously been shown to have no influence on NF-κB activation induced by Sendai virus infection. 22 However, it remains to be seen whether the MERS-CoV M protein could preferentially inhibit IRF3 and NF-κB signaling after RIG-I activation. To address this issue, two different luciferase reporter constructs, in which tandem copies of either IRF3-or NF-κB-binding elements were inserted into their promoter region, were used. The truncation mutant of RIG-I known as RIG-I N that contains only the N-terminal CARD domain was chosen to be the inducer in these assays because it is constitutively active and highly competent to induce these two pathways. 28 The MERS-CoV M protein was able to suppress the promoter activity of the IRF3-driven luciferase construct in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2A ; bars 3-5 compared with bar 2), but no inhibitory effect was observed with the NF-κB-driven construct ( Figure 2B ; bars 3-5 compared with bar 2) although the canonical inhibitor IκB-α could efficiently blunt its activation as a positive control ( Figure 2B ; bar 6 compared with bar 2). Hence, the suppressive effect of the MERS-CoV M protein is specific for IRF3 signaling but not NF-κB activation.

To delineate the action point of the MERS-CoV M protein in IFN antagonism, we tested the ability of the M protein to inhibit the activation signal induced by different signal transducers of the RLR pathway individually. The activation signal will be mostly unaffected if the activation event mediated by that transducer is downstream of the action point where M protein exerts its inhibitory effect. As described above, RIG-I N is a constitutively active mutant that resembles (1 μL/mL) in C for 16 h before harvest for dual-luciferase reporter assay. Bars represent the mean of three biological replicates (n = 3) and error bars indicate their s.d. The statistical significance between selected samples was evaluated using a two-tailed Student's t-test for unpaired samples with equal variance and P-value (P) was indicated. Figure 3A ; bars 3-5 compared with bar 2). A similar result was also obtained using MAVS as an activator ( Figure 3B ; bars 3-5 compared with bar 2), which is a mitochondrial adapter that diverts the activation signal from RIG-I to the IRF3 and NF-κB pathways. [44] [45] [46] [47] When activators committed to the IRF3 pathway were used, greater inhibitory effects were observed, as in the cases of TBK1 ( Figure 3C ; bars 3-5 compared with bar 2) and IKK-ε ( Figure 3D ; bars 3-5 compared with bar 2), which are kinases which recognize and phosphorylate IRF3 as direct substrate. [48] [49] [50] [51] Surprisingly, when a constitutively active mutant of IRF3 transcription factor (IRF3 5D), with five inducible phosphorylation sites at Ser/Thr residues mutated to Asp, 52 was employed, the expression of the M protein no longer quenched the IRF3-induced activation of IFN-β promoter ( Figure 3E ), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of M protein occurs upstream of IRF3 activation.

To further analyze the molecular mechanism and consequences through which MERS-CoV M protein exerts its inhibitory effect, we first investigated what signal transducer molecule might interact with the M protein. Several RLR transducers were ectopically expressed with MERS-CoV M protein in cultured cells for a coimmunoprecipitation experiment. When the transducers were precipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody, the M protein was only detected in TRAF3-containing precipitate ( Figure 4A ; lane 4 compared with lanes 1-3) even though M protein was abundantly expressed in all samples with other transducers (Figure 4A ; lower panel for input), TRAF3 functions as an adapter that bridges the mitochondrial transducer MAVS with the downstream signaling complex containing TBK1 and IKK-ε kinases that are essential for IRF3 activation. 34, 53 The physical association of the MERS-CoV M protein with TRAF3 ( Figure 4A ) prompted us to test whether the adapter function of TRAF3 would be particularly affected by M protein. We performed another co-immunoprecipitation experiment to explore the possibility that M protein could perturb the interaction of TRAF3 with the downstream transducer complex. When TRAF3 and TBK1 were ectopically expressed in cultured cells, the detection of TBK1 in TRAF3-immunoprecipitate confirmed the specific recruitment of TBK1 to TRAF3 in the absence of M protein ( Figure 4B ; lane 2 compared with lane 1). However, when M protein was added to the system, the interaction between TRAF3 and TBK1 was significantly disrupted ( Figure 4B ; lane 3 compared with lane 2), demonstrating that the physical association of MERS-CoV M protein with TRAF3 perturbs TRAF3-TBK1 interaction.

It was observed that MERS-CoV M protein disrupted TRAF3-TBK1 interaction ( Figure 4B ), which is required for IRF3 activation. We then evaluated whether IRF3 activation would be affected by the expression of M protein. IRF3 dimerization visualized by non-denaturing native PAGE is a sensitive assay for evaluating direct IRF3 activation. 39 Therefore, we ectopically expressed IRF3 and M protein with the inducer RIG-I N in cultured cells and subjected cell lysates directly to native PAGE to check for IRF3 dimerization. When the inducer RIG-I N was exclusively co-expressed with IRF3, the detection of an additional slow-migrating band indicated the activation and dimerization of IRF3, which would otherwise be entirely in its monomeric form in the absence of any activator ( Figure 4C ; lane 2 compared with lane 1). Interestingly, when M protein was expressed, the signal reflecting the dimeric form of IRF3 molecules was significantly diminished, even though the total IRF3 level expressed in all samples was highly comparable as detected by conventional denaturing SDS-PAGE ( Figure 4C ; lower panel for SDS-PAGE), suggesting that IRF3 activation was greatly inhibited by the MERS-CoV M protein. IRF3 phosphorylation was also suppressed with the expression of MERS M protein in a similar experimental setup ( Figure 4D ; lane 3 compared with lane 2). Together with other results, MERS-CoV M protein was thought to interact with TRAF3 to perturb TRAF3-TBK1 interaction, which, in turn, affects IRF3 phosphorylation and activation.

Given that the M proteins of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were capable of antagonizing IFN production through highly similar Innate immunosuppression by MERS-CoV M protein P-Y Lui et al mechanisms, 30 it will be of interest to analyze the sequence and domain architecture of the two proteins. Sequence alignment of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV M proteins revealed a strikingly high sequence similarity (470%) and the presence of three transmembrane domains at the N-termini ( Figure 5A ). According to the prediction results, we have initially constructed two truncation mutants for MERS-CoV M protein, an N-terminal transmembrane domain-containing mutant and a C-terminal mutant, and tested their inhibitory capacity in suppressing IFN-β expression using a luciferase reporter assay. However, neither exhibited an inhibitory effect (data not shown), possibly due to unstable expression or aberrant localization.

To overcome the inactivity of truncation mutants and to define the inhibitory activity of different domains, we decided to create chimeric proteins using domain swapping between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV M proteins. Particularly, the SN chimera contains the N-terminal transmembrane domains from SARS-CoV M protein and the C-terminal domain from MERS-CoV M protein, whereas the MN chimera contains the N-terminal transmembrane domains from the MERS-CoV M protein and the C-terminal domain from the SARS-CoV M protein ( Figure 5B ). The breakpoint was designed to occur immediately after the third predicted transmembrane domain at residue 106 and before the conserved Ser residue in both proteins at residue 107 ( Figure 5B ).

We next compared the inhibitory effect of these two chimeras and the full-length M proteins on IFN-β expression using the luciferase reporter assay. Our previous study showed that the IFN-antagonizing activity of the SARS-CoV M protein is mediated by its N-terminal transmembrane domains, but the C-terminal domain has no effect. 32 When we swapped the C-terminal domain of the SARS-CoV M protein with that of the MERS-CoV M protein in the SN chimera, a similar suppressive effect on IFN-β promoter activity was observed ( Figure 5C ; bar 4 compared with bar 3), consistent with our previous results. 32 Likewise, when we swapped the C-terminal domain of MERS-CoV M with that of SARS-CoV M protein in MN, the chimera was capable of suppressing IFN-β promoter activity to comparable level ( Figure 5C ; bar 8 compared with bar 7). Given that the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV M protein possesses no suppressive effect, 32 the inhibitory activity of the MN chimera would be predominantly due to the N-terminal domains of MERS-CoV M protein. A biochemical assay also confirmed that the MN chimera maintained the ability to interact with the TRAF3 adapter protein in a co-immunoprecipitation experiment ( Figure 5D ; lane 2 compared with lane 1). Therefore, we concluded that the N-terminal transmembrane domains of the MERS-CoV M protein are required and sufficient for its innate immunosuppressive activity.

To further determine whether the C-terminal domain of the MERS M protein also possesses IFN-antagonizing activity, we utilized the knowledge that the first transmembrane domain of SARS-CoV M protein is fully responsible for its suppression effect 32 

In this study, we reported that the MERS-CoV M protein inhibited IRF3 activation, hence IFN expression, by disrupting TRAF3-TBK1 interaction. This innate immunosuppressive activity of the MERS-CoV M protein was due to its conserved N-terminal transmembrane domains. Our mechanistic study complemented the previous work that showed that MERS-CoV M protein had IFN-antagonizing activity. 22 Both studies demonstrated that MERS-CoV M protein suppressed IRF3 activity but not NF-κB signaling. It is known that the activation of RIG-I and MAVS results in the activation of both IRF3 and NF-κB. 28, [44] [45] [46] Our results indicated that the MERS-CoV M protein was capable of differentially suppressing the RIG-I-induced activation of IRF3 (Figure 2 ). This provides further support to the bifurcation of IRF3 and NF-κB signaling subsequent to RIG-I and MAVS activation. Further investigations should elucidate the mechanism by which the MERS-CoV M protein preferentially modulates IRF3 activators such as TBK1, while sparing NF-κB activators such as CARD9. 47 We provided evidence that the TRAF3-TBK1 interaction as well as IRF3 phosphorylation and dimerization were affected by the MERS-CoV M protein (Figure 4 ). Our findings fill the knowledge gap by providing novel mechanistic insight into the innate immunosuppressive activity of MERS-CoV M protein.

In our study, TRAF3 was also shown to interact with the MERS-CoV M protein ( Figure 4A ). In line with this, the adapter function of TRAF3 in TBK1 recruitment and subsequent IRF3 activation was perturbed by MERS-CoV M protein ( Figures 4B-D) , which plausibly contributed to the IFN antagonism of the MERS-CoV M protein (Figures 1-3) . The MERS-CoV M protein is a transmembrane protein that was shown to co-localize with markers of the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartments in the perinuclear area. 22 Although TRAF3 is known to adapt the mitochondrial transducer MAVS, it is not associated with mitochondria but rather with the Golgi apparatus and ER-Golgi intermediate compartments in unstimulated conditions, 30, 54 rendering it susceptible to interaction with the MERS-CoV M protein. Upon stimulation with ligands or viral infection, TRAF3 appears on membrane-bound fragments originating from Golgi. Retention of TRAF3 in ER-to-Golgi compartments and inability to form Golgi fragments rendered IFN-β expression inefficient. 54 Therefore, whether TRAF3-containing Golgi fragment formation is affected by MERS-CoV M protein warrants further analysis. This may serve as a novel mechanism by which virus-encoded proteins counteract host IFN production.

MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are two highly pathogenic coronaviruses that have caused hundreds of deaths. On one hand, the development of relevant prophylactic and therapeutic agents has been well under way. [55] [56] [57] On the other hand, the identification of the pathogenic factors in these viruses is also in full swing. The M protein is a pathogenic factor by virtue of its IFN-antagonizing property. Both the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV M proteins were found to suppress IFN production with a highly similar mechanism in which the IRF3phosphorylating complex of TRAF3·TANK·TBK1/IKK-ε was affected by their N-terminal transmembrane domains. 30, 32 Interestingly, in the case of community-acquired human coronavirus HKU1, which normally causes common cold in infected individuals, its M protein showed no IFN antagonistic property, 32 further supporting the importance of the M protein in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV pathogenesis. Using a side-by-side comparison of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV M proteins, we discovered that the extent by which the MERS-CoV M protein suppressed IFN-β promoter activity was lower than that by SARS-CoV M protein. This difference might be explained by the strengths of the interaction of MERS-CoV M protein with other transducers. Whereas the MERS-CoV M protein was found to be strongly associated with TRAF3, its interaction with TBK1 or IKK-ε was undetectable (data not shown). This distinguished MERS-CoV M protein from the SARS-CoV M protein, which interacts potently with every component of the TRAF3·TANK·TBK1/IKK-ε complex. 30 Further investigations are required to shed light on how the interaction of the M protein with TRAF3 complex might influence MERS-CoV pathogenesis.

Coronaviruses encode multiple proteins to counteract the host innate antiviral response. 58-60 MERS-CoV is no exception. Several MERS-CoV-encoded proteins have been identified to be IFN antagonists. We, and others, have characterized at least three IFN-antagonizing proteins encoded by MERS-CoV. In addition to the M protein reported in this study, ORF4a is a dsRNA-binding protein, which directly inhibits RLR activation induced by dsRNA and/or the protein co-activator PACT. 24, 25 In addition, our unpublished data also revealed that ORF4b is a potent IFN antagonist. This is in line with findings by other groups although the mechanistic details of its action have not well documented. 22, 23 One recent report suggested that ORF4b might not only interact directly with TBK1/ IKKε in the cytoplasm but also perturb IFN production in the nucleus through an as yet unknown mechanism. 61 Nevertheless, how M, ORF4a, ORF4b and the other IFN-antagonizing proteins of MERS-CoV coordinate with each other to modulate the host innate antiviral response to facilitate viral replication and propagation remains elusive.

BMC Medicine RNA viruses in community-acquired childhood pneumonia in semi-urban Nepal; a cross-sectional study

Background: Pneumonia is among the main causes of illness and death in children <5 years of age. There is a need to better describe the epidemiology of viral community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in developing countries.

Methods: From July 2004 to June 2007, we examined nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from 2,230 cases of pneumonia (World Health Organization criteria) in children 2 to 35 months old recruited in a randomized trial of zinc supplementation at a field clinic in Bhaktapur, Nepal. The specimens were examined for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus type A (InfA) and B (InfB), parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3 (PIV1, PIV2, and PIV3), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) using a multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay.

We identified 919 virus isolates in 887 (40.0%) of the 2,219 NPA specimens with a valid PCR result, of which 334 (15.1%) yielded RSV, 164 (7.4%) InfA, 129 (5.8%) PIV3, 98 (4.4%) PIV1, 93 (4.2%) hMPV, 84 (3.8%) InfB, and 17 (0.8%) PIV2. CAP occurred in an epidemic pattern with substantial temporal variation during the three years of study. The largest peaks of pneumonia occurrence coincided with peaks of RSV infection, which occurred in epidemics during the rainy season and in winter. The monthly number of RSV infections was positively correlated with relative humidity (r s = 0.40, P = 0.01), but not with temperature or rainfall. An hMPV epidemic occurred during one of the three winter seasons and the monthly number of hMPV cases was also associated with relative humidity (r s = 0.55, P = 0.0005).

Conclusion: Respiratory RNA viruses were detected from NPA in 40% of CAP cases in our study. The most commonly isolated viruses were RSV, InfA, and PIV3. RSV infections contributed substantially to the observed CAP epidemics. The occurrence of viral CAP in this community seemed to reflect more or less overlapping micro-epidemics with several respiratory viruses, highlighting the challenges of developing and implementing effective public health control measures.

Viruses are important causes of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in developing countries [1] [2] [3] . The most common cause of viral LRTI is RNA viruses: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human parainfluenza virus (PIV), influenza virus, and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Adenovirus is probably the only DNA virus that is a common cause of LRTI in children [2] .

Respiratory viruses, and especially RSV, are leading causes of hospitalization in infants and young children during the cold season in temperate climates [4, 5] . Studies in the 1980s highlighted the importance of viruses in LRTI and identified RSV as the predominant cause in children aged <5 years also in developing countries [6] . This was confirmed in a WHO-sponsored denominator-based study of RSV-associated LRTI in four developing countries [7] . Moreover, while influenza virus is being recognized as causing severe LRTI in otherwise healthy children in highincome countries [8] , little information on its epidemiology is available from resource-poor settings. A few studies on the more recently discovered hMPV have been published, but these studies were small and covered varying seasons and age groups [9] [10] [11] . Seasonality of RSV and influenza in tropical and sub-tropical regions differs from the well-defined seasonal outbreaks seen in temperate climates, and the seasonal pattern of these infections in developing countries varies considerably between regions [1, 12] . Knowledge of the local epidemiology of these infections is essential for predicting epidemics and planning preventive measures, such as development and introduction of vaccines in low-and middle-income countries.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a novel, but now widely applied, method for the detection of respiratory viruses from clinical samples. Compared with conventional methods, PCR has significantly increased sensitivity for respiratory viral diagnosis [13, 14] and has also demonstrated high specificity [15, 16] . Viral etiology data for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) from developing countries based on molecular diagnostic methods are scarce, however, and no such studies have to our knowledge been conducted over several years and on a large number of children.

We sought to identify common viral pathogens in CAP in a large number of Nepalese children 2 to 35 months of age visiting a field clinic. We also wished to describe the seasonal pattern of respiratory viral infections over a 3-year period and explore possible associations with available meteorological data.

Study participants were recruited from the district of Bhaktapur in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. A total of 1,913 (86.2%) of the 2,219 cases were recruited from within Bhaktapur municipality, a semi-urban agricultural based town with a population of approximately 80,000, of which we at any time had approximately 4,500 children 2 to 35 months of age under surveillance for respiratory illness. Low income, low dietary intakes and low consumption of dairy and animal products are widespread, as in most parts of Nepal. Malnutrition, mainly manifested as stunting and anemia, are common among children less than 5 years of age [17] .

The Kathmandu Valley is situated at an altitude of 1,300 to 1,350 meters above sea level and has a sub-tropical, temperate climate. There are four distinct seasons; premonsoon/spring (March to May), monsoon/summer (June to September), post-monsoon/autumn (October to November) and winter (December to February) [18] . Temperatures may rise to 35°C in summer, while minimum temperatures can fall to 0°C in winter.

We recruited cases from an open cohort of children less than 3 years of age, who were under monthly active and passive surveillance for respiratory illness. Trained fieldworkers referred children with respiratory complaints to the study clinic at the outpatient department (OPD) at Siddhi Memorial Hospital in Bhaktapur, and families could bring their children for free treatment at our clinic for common childhood illnesses. Children residing in Bhaktapur district, but outside the municipality, were only under such passive surveillance. Children aged 2 to 35 months presenting at our study clinic were screened for fast breathing or lower chest wall indrawing (LCI) and classified according to the standard World Health Organization (WHO) algorithm for acute respiratory infection (ARI) [19] (Figure 1 ). Pneumonia was defined as cough or difficult breathing combined with fast breathing, that is ≥ 50 breaths/min for children 2 to 11 months old, and ≥ 40 breaths/min for children ≥ 12 months old. Severe pneumonia was defined as cough or difficult breathing combined with LCI. Children with audible or auscultatory wheeze were given 2 doses of 2.5 mg nebulized salbutamol administered 15 min apart followed by reassessment after 30 min, which is in accordance with the revised WHO guidelines [20] . A child was included only if he or she had fast breathing or LCI at reassessment.

During a 3-year period from 29 June 2004 to 30 June 2007, we collected 2,230 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) specimens from equally many cases of pneumonia in 1,909 children (some children were included more than once). These children were, after obtaining informed parental consent, included in a study on zinc as adjuvant therapy for CAP (to be presented elsewhere). All included children were randomized to receive either 10 to 20 mg elemental zinc dispersed in water or placebo tablets daily for 14 days. Cases with very severe pneumonia/disease, that is, cough or difficult breathing with stridor when calm or any general danger signs (inability to drink/ breastfeed, persistent vomiting, convulsions, lethargy, or unconsciousness) were not included in the study, but instead referred to a tertiary level hospital after initial treatment. Other exclusion criteria are listed in the study profile ( Figure 1 ). Children could not participate in the study again until after 6 months due to the 6-month follow-up scheme of the clinical trial.

The child's respiratory rate (RR) was assessed according to WHO guidelines [19] , counting twice for 1 min using a UNICEF timer. The lower of the two counts was used in the analyses. Children were weighed using a UNICEF electronic scale (SECA, Hamburg, Germany) accurate to 100 g with a mother/child-function, so the weight of the child could be determined while held by his or her mother. The child's length/height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a wooden measuring board (as recumbent length in children <2 years of age and as height in children ≥ 2 years of age). Oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) was measured either on a finger or a toe with a pulse oxymeter (Siemens MicO2, Siemens Medical Systems Inc, Danvers, MA, USA) using a pediatric sensor (Nellcor, Pleasanton, CA, USA). It was recorded twice 1 min apart after stabilization of the sensor for 1 min. The higher of the two measurements was used in the analyses. The concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP) was determined from a capillary or venous blood specimen using a semi-quantitative rapid test (QuikRead ® CRP, Orion Diagnostica, Espoo, Finland) and a portable photometer (QuikRead ® 101, Orion Diagnostica) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The test had a measurement range of 8 to 160 mg/L and values outside the measurement range were indicated as <8 or >160 mg/L. NPA specimens were obtained using a sterile, disposable suction catheter (Pennine Healthcare Ltd, Derbyshire, Study profile for children 2 to 35 months of age included in a study of viral community-acquired pneumonia in Bhaktapur, Nepal, from July 2004 to June 2007 Figure 1 Study profile for children 2 to 35 months of age included in a study of viral community-acquired pneumonia in Bhaktapur, Nepal, from July 2004 to June 2007. Severe malnutrition was defined as <70% NCHS (National Center for Health Statistics) median weight for height. Severe anemia was defined as hemoglobin <7 g/dl. 

The specimens were refrigerated at 2 to 8°C following collection at the field clinic and transported on ice every working day to the main laboratory in Kathmandu, where they were vortexed and divided into three equal aliquots in sterile vials (CryoTubes™, Nunc AS, Roskilde, Denmark). The aliquots analyzed in Nepal were either frozen at -70°C or kept at 2 to 8°C in the refrigerator before analysis. A separate comparative study verified that there were no substantial differences in proportion detected between the two alternative storage temperatures for up to three months (unpublished data). One aliquot was immediately frozen at -70°C and transported to Norway on dry ice and again stored at -70°C in case there should be a need for reanalysis.

One aliquot of each specimen was tested at our research laboratory in Nepal at the Institute of Medicine, Tribhuvan University, for RSV, InfA and InfB, PIV types 1, 2 and 3, and hMPV using a commercially available multiplex reverse transcriptase PCR assay (Hexaplex Plus ® , Prodesse Inc, Waukeshaw, WI, USA) with minor modifications of the manufacturer's instructions [22] and according to previous descriptions [15] . In brief, nucleic acids were extracted from 360 μl of NPA (or plasmid RNA from positive control transcripts) using a nucleic acids extraction kit (Roche High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit, F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each run of the assay included a positive RNA control and a negative control (virus transport medium), starting at nucleic acid isolation. Specimens and negative controls were individually spiked with 40 μl of internal control during nucleic acid isolation to identify any inhibitors. cDNA was produced by reverse transcription using random hexamers, murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (ABI, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), RNase inhibitor (ABI) and 3 μl of extracted viral RNA. Amplification reactions were performed using GeneAmp ® PCR System 2700 (ABI). Ten μl of newly synthesized cDNA was added to a mix consisting of 2.5 U of AmpliTaq ® Gold DNA polymerase (ABI) and a Super-Mix containing seven pairs of forward and backward primers flanking unique sequences of the seven viruses (the hemagglutinin neuraminidase gene of PIV types 1, 2 and 3, the matrix protein gene of InfA, the NS1 and NS2 genes of InfB, the NS1 and NS2 genes of RSV and the nucleocapsid gene of hMPV). After initially holding the PCR mixture at 95°C for 10 min, amplification was performed as follows: two cycles at 95°C for 1 min, 55°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 45 sec, and then 38 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 60°C for 30 sec, 72°C for 30 sec, followed by an additional 7 min at 72°C and immediate cooling to 4°C. After amplification, the PCR products were purified using Qiagen QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN Inc, Valencia, CA, USA) and analyzed by enzyme hybridization assay [15] , measuring the optical density at 450 nm (OD 450 ) using a micro-plate reader (Stat Fax ® 2100, Awareness Technology Inc, Palm City, FL, USA).

Three hundred and twenty-four NPA aliquots were stored beyond 3 months at 2 to 8°C before analysis in Nepal. Of these, we re-analyzed the 133 that yielded a negative result, now using the aliquot that had been frozen at -70°C and transported on dry ice to Norway. This was done at the Department of Microbiology and Infection Control, University Hospital of North Norway, Tromsø, Norway, using the Hexaplex Plus assay and an automated extraction platform (NucliSens ® easyMAG, bioMérieux, Durham, NC, USA). Nucleic acids were extracted from 400 μl of sample, negative and positive processing controls and amplification control using the extraction principle with magnetic particles of this platform.

The criteria for a positive test were OD 450 ≥ 0.400 and at least four times greater than the OD 450 of the negative control [22] . An OD 450 < 0.300 with an OD 450 of the internal control >2.00 indicated a negative test. A reading from 0.300 to 0.399 was interpreted as indeterminate and the sample examined again. If the same result was obtained on repeated testing, the NPA was deemed negative. If the OD 450 of the internal control for a given NPA was <2.00 and sample absorbance was < 0.400 for all tested agents, the NPA was tested again. If the same result was obtained on repeated testing, the interpretation was indeterminate due to potential inhibition, and the case not included in the analyses.

The data were double entered and compared on a daily basis using Microsoft Visual FoxPro version 6.0 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). Statistical analyses were performed using Stata/MP 10.0 for Macintosh (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). The 95% confidence intervals (CI) for proportions were calculated with binominal exact confidence interval using the 'ci' command. Of the children included in this analysis, 274 were enrolled twice and 18 thrice. We used the 'cluster' option in Stata to adjust the confidence intervals of the proportions for repeated enrollments and thus allowed for possible dependence of observations in a child that was included more than once. Anthropometric measures were expressed as Z-scores, which were generated using the WHO Child Growth Standards 2005 [23] . Meteorological data for the Kathmandu airport weather station (located approximately 10 km from Bhaktapur) were obtained from Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology, Kathmandu, Nepal. Mean daily values for relative humidity and temperature were calculated as the average of two daily measurements (relative humidity at 8.45 AM and 5.45 PM, and maximum and minimum temperature). We estimated the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient to describe the association between the monthly number of infections with each virus and meteorological factors.

The study had ethical clearance from the Research Ethics Committee of the Institute of Medicine at Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu and the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics of Western Norway. The implementation of the project was in agreement with the international ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects as stated in the latest version of the Helsinki Declaration.

We excluded 11 cases from the analysis due to inhibition of the PCR. Out of the remaining 2,219 pneumonia cases, Infection with more than one virus was identified in 29 (3.3%) of the 887 positive specimens. The most common double infection was PIV3 in combination with hMPV, which was found in nine cases. We identified three viruses in one case (PIV1, PIV2, RSV) and four viruses in another (PIV1, PIV2, InfB, RSV).

The occurrence of CAP during the course of our study exhibited substantial temporal variation and a clear epidemic pattern (Figure 2 ). In each of the three years, we observed a sharp increase in the occurrence of pneumonia at the end of the monsoon season in August to September. There were also significant CAP epidemics during winter, the first year peaking in February and the second year in December, but we observed no winter epidemic in the third year. There were also smaller peaks of CAP in spring. Epidemics of infection with individual respiratory viruses contributed to literally all of these CAP epidemics, such as the three RSV epidemics (the second of which was compounded by epidemics with InfA and InfB infections), an InfA epidemic superimposed on an hMPV epidemic, and a PIV3 epidemic ( Figure 3 ). Displays of the spatial-temporal distribution of these individual epidemics are visualized in [24] . PIV1 infections occurred in small numbers throughout the year, whereas only 17 cases of PIV2 infection were seen during the entire study period.

The monthly distribution of RSV infections and meteorological data are shown in Figure 4 . The monthly number of RSV infections was positively correlated with relative humidity in the Spearman's correlation analysis, but not with temperature or rainfall ( Table 3 ). The same association with relative humidity was seen for hMPV. In contrast, the number of PIV3 was positively associated with both temperature and rainfall, and not with relative humidity. InfA did not correlate with any of these meteorological factors, while InfB showed moderate negative correlation with all three factors.

This is to our knowledge the largest epidemiological study in almost four decades of childhood CAP in a developing country that identifies several common viruses. We isolated at least one viral pathogen using PCR from 40% of children during the 3-year study period. The literature reveals few studies based on sensitive molecular diagnosis from similar resource-poor settings. Apart from recent studies on hMPV, most previous studies in developing countries have not used PCR for virus detection [1] .

Hospital-based studies in children <5 years of age from developing countries published over the last 20 years have identified viruses (excluding measles) in 8.4% [25] to 45% [26] of LRTI episodes. One of the larger studies, which included nearly 1,500 Pakistani children <5 years of age, detected a virus (including adenovirus) in 37% of cases using viral culture and immunofluorescence (IF) [27] . Previous community-based studies with longitudi-nal follow-up of children have identified viruses in 11% to 45% of LRTI cases [1, 28, 29] .

Not unexpectedly, RSV was by far the most common virus in our study, identified in 15.1% of all pneumonia cases and 37.7% of viral positive cases. Etiology studies in developing countries that included viruses have identified RSV in a median of 20% (5th to 95th percentile 1 to 53) of LRTI cases [30] and in 6% to 96% (mean 39%) of LRTI cases with a viral etiology [1] . It should be noted that many of these studies also included measles. A recently published denominator-based study from a birth cohort comprising 635 Kenyan children followed through three RSV epidemics reported that 13% of cases with LRTI were attributable to RSV infection, which was diagnosed using IF [31] . In India, RSV accounted for 17% of hospitalized cases with LRTI in New Delhi [32] and 7% of LRTI cases included in a 3-year longitudinal community study in Haryana [28] . After RSV, InfA and PIV3 were the most common viruses in our study, as reported elsewhere [1, 3, 28] . We detected hMPV in 4.2% of pneumonia cases. It is estimated that MPV worldwide accounts for 5 to 7% of ARI in young children requiring hospitalization [33] . In India, hMPV was detected in 3.2% of 662 children hospitalized for ARI over a 2-year period from April 2005 [34] .

RSV and influenza virus are known to occur in welldefined recurrent epidemics during the cold season in temperate climates [1, 2] . In tropical and subtropical areas, RSV infections have been reported to peak more often in relation to the wet season, but locations close to the equator show a less consistent pattern, some with almost continuous RSV activity and varying seasonal peaks [1, 7] . Studies in the Indian subcontinent have reported RSV infections to peak both in the cold season [27] and in the rainy season [35, 36] , as well as being detectable throughout the year [35, 37] . We observed RSV epidemics both in winter and during the monsoon. The virus was isolated during a period of 6 to 7 months and the epidemic peaks were observed with intervals of 15 and 9 months, which is consistent with patterns described elsewhere [31, 38] .

We detected influenza in 25 of the 36 study months. The largest influenza peaks occurred in winter from December to February in the first two years, but we also isolated influenza during the monsoon period. A summer outbreak of influenza has previously been reported from Nepal [39] . Surveillance data from 2007 at the Kathmandu sentinel site has showed that InfB was prevalent throughout the year except in May, and that InfA prevailed during June to August and reappeared in December [40] . Unlike in temperate regions, where influenza occurs in well-defined outbreaks lasting 2 to 3 months once a year in the winter, influenza is detectable for a greater part of the year in tropical and sub-tropical regions and the timing of outbreaks is less predictable [41, 42] . Influenza peaks have been reported to occur during periods of high rainfall in many tropical locations [12] .

We observed one distinct hMPV epidemic, which peaked between December 2004 and January 2005. The epidemic lasted from July 2004 to January 2005 and comprised 70% of the hMPV isolates detected during the entire 3year study period. Substantial variation in the yearly incidence of hMPV has also been reported earlier [43, 44] . Epidemics with this virus have been reported to occur during late winter to spring in temperate climates [33, 45] , including North India [46] , where the majority of hMPV were detected from December to February, and Korea [45] , where hMPV peaked between February and April. A study in subtropical Hong Kong found hMPV infections mainly in the spring and summer months [47] , similar to that of RSV [48] and occasionally influenza [49] .

We isolated PIV3 in 27 months of our 36 month-study, but an increasing number of infections were seen between April to May and September each year, while the largest epidemic occurred in June 2006. The virus has been known to exhibit an endemic pattern and to cause yearly epidemics in spring and summer in temperate climates [50] . PIV1 was isolated in smaller numbers throughout the study period (in 28 of 36 months), and we could not observe the biennial pattern of fall epidemics seen elsewhere [51] .

As could be observed from the displays of the occurrence of viral CAPs in the study children [24] , the spatial-temporal distribution of these infections revealed more or less overlapping micro-epidemics with several respiratory viral pathogens spreading between households in Bhaktapur.

Despite two of the three RSV epidemics occurring during the summer monsoon, neither rainfall nor temperature was significantly associated with RSV infections in our study, while there was a positive correlation with relative humidity. In tropical Asian countries, somewhat contradictory patterns of associations between RSV and meteorological factors have been observed. In Hong Kong, the monthly incidence of RSV infection was positively correlated with both temperature and relative humidity [48] , whereas in Malaysia, the number of RSV infections was inversely correlated with temperature [52] . RSV infections peaked towards the end of the rainy season during the first and third year of our study. We explored whether there could be an association between preceding rainfall and RSV infections, and by introducing a 2-month lag after peak precipitation, such an association could indeed be identified (data not shown).

A strong association with relative humidity was also found for hMPV infections. Association with meteorological factors has not previously been described for this virus. Belonging to the Pneumovirinae subfamily [53] , both RSV and hMPV could require similar conditions for transmission and infectivity. In contrast, PIV3 was strongly and positively correlated with both temperature and rainfall, but not with relative humidity. A study in Singapore found no such associations for PIV3 [54] . It is also interesting to note that, in our study, InfB infections showed an inverse correlation with relative humidity, temperature and rainfall, while InfA infections did not correlate with any of these meteorological factors. In Singapore, InfA outbreaks were also not associated with meteorological factors, but InfB infections were reported to positively correlate with rainfall [54] .

As derived from the correlation analyses (r s = 0.68), up to 46% of the monthly variation in occurrence of viral infections in our study could be explained by meteorological factors. However, the underlying reasons for the observed seasonal patterns demonstrated by these individual respiratory viruses are unclear. Climate could have a direct impact on virus survival, transmission efficiency, and host immunity, or have an indirect effect through climatedependent behavior change, such as indoor crowding and eating habits [55] . We detected more than one virus in 3.3% of the virus-positive NPA specimens, which is similar to what is reported using molecular methods detecting the same viruses as in our study [56] , but lower compared with studies using molecular methods detecting a wider array of viruses [57, 58] . The frequency of viral co-detections varies widely and depends on the number of diagnostic methods applied [59] and the number of pathogens tested for [58] . By employing multiplex PCR assays for 11 viruses, a study in 515 Korean children aged ≤ 5 years detected viruses in 312 (60.6%) of cases and a viral co-detection in 36 (11.5%) [45] . In addition to the seven viruses identified in our study, the Korean study also detected adenovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, and bocavirus; and, notably, the last virus was identified in 22 of the 36 co-detections. The clinical role of bocavirus in pneumonia in otherwise healthy children is unclear [60, 61] , as is the importance of multiple viral infections [57, 59] . Quantitative PCR methods to determine viral load in clinical specimens could provide valuable information on the pathogenetic role of each virus in such co-detections [61] , as could case-control studies.

Compared with pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis is not common in young Nepalese children [62] . To avoid including cases of undiagnosed tuberculosis and reactive airway disease, we did not include children that had been coughing for more than 14 days and we reassessed respiratory rate in wheezers after salbutamol administration before diagnosis of pneumonia [20] . The number of measles cases in Nepal has decreased dramatically since 2003 [63] . Measles vaccination is recommended at 9 months and the vaccine coverage among those that were 9 months or older in our study area was >90% (unpublished data). Moreover, less than 1% of our cases had a rash and all of these were above 1 year of age. Thus, we believe that our sample consisted of children with pneumonia, and not tuberculosis, bronchial asthma, or measles.

Despite the high sensitivity and specificity of the Hexaplex Plus assay [15] , we may have underestimated the number of viral infections. Viral load in a specimen depends on several conditions, such as time of collection in relation to onset of illness. In most of the study children, the NPA specimen was collected early in the course of illness, which increases the likelihood of detecting an infectious agent [14] . Moreover, by not including children who had taken antibiotics during the last 48 hours, we primarily recruited new cases of pneumonia. Using multiplex instead of single molecular assays may have contributed to an underestimation of the number of viral CAP cases, as some loss of sensitivity is an inherent limitation of multiplex PCR assays [13] .

We observed a large month-to-month variation in the proportion of CAP cases from whom we identified a res- piratory RNA virus, largely reflecting the epidemic pattern of viral infections in this sub-tropical setting. A limitation of our study was that we were not able to include more etiologic agents in our diagnostic panel. Adenovirus is among the more common viral respiratory pathogens causing LRTI in preschool children [64] . Atypical bacteria, like Mycoplasma pneumoniae, cause pneumonia more frequently in school-age children, but can also cause mild infections in younger children [65] . Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza are the main bacterial pathogens causing childhood pneumonia. However, nasopharyngeal carriage of these bacteria is frequent in healthy, young children [66] . Moreover, their detection in pneumonia is hampered by the difficulties of obtaining specimens from the lower airways and the low sensitivity of identifying these pathogens by blood culture [67] , and such invasive methods are not well suited for community settings. S. pneumoniae has been suggested to play a role in the development of virus-associated pneumonia in children in hospital, especially in cases with influenza and PIV types 1 to 3 [68] . The monthly number of cases where we did not identify any virus was particularly pronounced in the CAP epidemic that peaked in December 2005 (Figure 2) , which comprised the largest outbreaks of influenza A and B (Figure 3 ). There is abundant evidence that infection with influenza viruses predisposes for pneumococcal disease [69] . Additionally, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the cases where we detected a viral pathogen in fact had a mixed viral-bacterial pneumonia or pneumonia after acquisition of a new pneumococcal serotype during an upper respiratory viral infection. Again, quantitative PCR methods and carefully conducted casecontrol studies could shed light on the clinical importance of detecting viral pathogens in NPA specimens from children with pneumonia.

We detected a viral pathogen from the nasopharynx in 40% of the children with CAP in this study, indicating that respiratory RNA viruses play an important role in this common childhood illness in Nepal. RSV was the most common agent isolated, and occurred with considerable temporal variation. As for many other common childhood infections, such as diarrhea, the occurrence of viral CAP in this community seemed to reflect more or less overlapping micro-epidemics with several respiratory viruses, highlighting the challenges of developing and implementing effective public health control measures in resource-poor settings.

Effect of human movement on airborne disease transmission in an airplane cabin: study using numerical modeling and quantitative risk analysis

Background: Airborne transmission of respiratory infectious disease in indoor environment (e.g. airplane cabin, conference room, hospital, isolated room and inpatient ward) may cause outbreaks of infectious diseases, which may lead to many infection cases and significantly influences on the public health. This issue has received more and more attentions from academics. This work investigates the influence of human movement on the airborne transmission of respiratory infectious diseases in an airplane cabin by using an accurate human model in numerical simulation and comparing the influences of different human movement behaviors on disease transmission. Methods: The Eulerian-Lagrangian approach is adopted to simulate the dispersion and deposition of the expiratory aerosols. The dose-response model is used to assess the infection risks of the occupants. The likelihood analysis is performed as a hypothesis test on the input parameters and different human movement pattern assumptions. An in-flight SARS outbreak case is used for investigation. A moving person with different moving speeds is simulated to represent the movement behaviors. A digital human model was used to represent the detailed profile of the occupants, which was obtained by scanning a real thermal manikin using the 3D laser scanning system.

The analysis results indicate that human movement can strengthen the downward transport of the aerosols, significantly reduce the overall deposition and removal rate of the suspended aerosols and increase the average infection risk in the cabin. The likelihood estimation result shows that the risk assessment results better fit the outcome of the outbreak case when the movements of the seated passengers are considered. The intake fraction of the moving person is significantly higher than most of the seated passengers. Conclusions: The infection risk distribution in the airplane cabin highly depends on the movement behaviors of the passengers and the index patient. The walking activities of the crew members and the seated passengers can significantly increase their personal infection risks. Taking the influence of the movement of the seated passengers and the index patient into consideration is necessary and important. For future studies, investigations on the behaviors characteristics of the passengers during flight will be useful and helpful for infection control.

Nowadays, respiratory infectious diseases are threatening the life of humans around the world [1] . Almost 4 million deaths due to respiratory infections diseases and 1.5 million deaths due to tuberculosis are reported every year [2] . In the past four decades, airborne transmission of respiratory infectious diseases within enclosed environment has been widely reported by many epidemiology reports [3] [4] [5] [6] . In an airplane cabin, the airflow from front to back of the cabin (longitudinal) is minimal due to the ventilation system, which means in-flight transmission of disease contaminants should be confined within two rows of an infected passenger [6, 7] . One possible cause of the infection of the passengers seated far away from the index patient might be the movements of the walking crew members or passengers along the aisle in the airplane cabin [8] . The walking persons might also get infected when they move close to the infector [5] .

Recently, studies on the aerodynamic effects of human movement have received more and more attentions [9] . Significant works have been done on this issue, as summarized in Table 1 . In experimental investigations, Matsumoto and Ohba [10] , Poussou et al. [11] and Bjørn and Nielsen [12] showed that human movement inside enclosed environments could significantly influence contaminant transport and personal exposures to contaminants. By using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods, more studies were performed in different indoor environments. Simple human models [13] [14] [15] and realistic walking human models [16, 17] were used as the walking humans in the simulations. Most of these studies [13, 14, 16, 17] used tracer gas as the contaminant, but gaseous contaminants were not accurate enough to represent the transmission of respiration droplets. Wang and Chow [17] and Choi and Edwards [15, 16] studied the influence of human walking on the dispersion and deposition of expiratory droplets in indoor environment. Among previous literatures, significant differences can be found in their methods and conclusions.

According to the transmission mechanism of respiratory infectious disease, the diffusion and dispersion of the aerosols expelled by respiratory activities are important and necessary for infection risk assessment [18] . The airborne transmission of these aerosols in an airplane The removal of contaminants was not obviously affected by the moving speed Choi and Edwards [15] CFD a realistic walking human model a Room-Room and a Room-Hall configuration particle The rate of mass transport increases as the walking speed increases, but the total amount of material transported is more influenced by the initial proximity of the human from the doorway.

The methods used for risk assessment of expiratory aerosols and gaseous contaminants are also different [20] . Until now, studies on the effects of human movement on aerosols transmission and infection risk distribution are still rare. In this work, the effects of human movement on respiratory infectious disease transmission are investigated. An in-flight outbreak case is used for investigation. A manikin with a detailed human profile is also used in the computational geometry. The Eulerian-Lagrangian approach is adopted to simulate the dispersion and deposition of the expiratory aerosols. The infection risks of the occupants are assessed by using quantitative risk analysis, and the influence of human movement on infectious disease transmission is also analyzed. Likelihood analysis is then performed as a hypothesis test on the input parameters and the different human movement pattern assumptions.

The outbreak case and computational geometry On March 15, 2003, 120 persons (112 passengers, 6 flight attendants and 2 pilots) flew from Hong Kong to Beijing by a Boeing 737-300, including an infector of SARS seated in the middle of the economy cabin of the airplane. After the three-hour flight, laboratory-confirmed SARS developed in 20 persons and 2 others gave diagnoses of probable SARS [6] . The computational geometry of the airplane cabin with occupants was numerically constructed and meshed based on the outbreak case. As shown in Figure 1 (a), a twelve-row, single-aisle, fully occupied cabin section was constructed for simulation. Seventy-two passengers including the index patient were seated in the cabin. A movable person stood at one end of the aisle. The dimensions of the numerical airplane cabin section were 4.58 m × 9.72 m × 2.20 m (W × L × H) with a volume of 68.85 m 3 . The origin of the coordinate system was located on the ground at the left corner of the cabin behind the standing person, and the coordinate system met the right-hand rule. Ventilation air was supplied from two longitudinal overhead slots (0.012 m W × 9.72 m L each) located in the middle of the ceiling. The outlets were located along the lower longitudinal edge of the floor, one on each side. To represent the detailed profile of the occupants, a digital model was used, which was obtained by scanning a real thermal manikin using the 3D laser scanning system. Detailed facial features such as head, shoulders and limbs were contained in this model, as shown in Figure 1 (b) and (c).

Gambit (version 2.4.6) was used to build the geometry domain and generate the cells for CFD simulation. The meshes were automatically generated by Gambit according to the mesh type and maximum mesh size. The whole region around the seated passengers and the standing person were meshed by unstructured grids of tetrahedron. The maximum mesh size was 0.03 m and the total number was 9,098,636. Other parts of the cabin (the aisle behind and in front of the standing person) were meshed by structured grids of hexahedron. The maximum mesh size was 0.025 m and the total number was 99,264. The grid system was chosen based on the grid convergence index (GCI) analysis [21] . By comparing the computed velocity magnitudes at 800 selected points in the GCI analysis, finer grid system did not have much improvement in GCI compared to the selected grid system (GCI finer < 5%) [22] . So a grid system containing 9,197,900 cells was finally adopted in this computational geometry.

In this work, a multiphase numerical model based on the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach was adopted, which has been widely employed in aerosol dynamics simulation in enclosed environments [17, [22] [23] [24] . In this approach, the governing equations of the carrier phase were numerically solved in the computational geometry based on the Eulerian framework [23] . Transient species transport model for water vapor was added to the Eulerian carrier phase models to represent the humidity in the air [23] . For the discrete phase, the governing equations were described in the Lagrangian framework. Each aerosol released from the injections point was tracked individually in the Lagrangian frame for its instantaneous position and velocity.

The governing equations for the carrier phase and the discrete phase were solved by using a finite-volume based code, ANSYS (version 12.1.4). In the transient simulation, the interaction between the discrete phase and the continuous phase was also considered as the external body forces and computed during the continuous phase iterations [22] . The particles were tracked using the Lagrangian method along with the flow equations at the end of each time step. The Re-Normalization Group (RNG) k-ε model was used for modeling the turbulence in this computational geometry due to its good accuracy, computing efficiency, robustness and affordability [25] [26] [27] . The Differential Viscosity Model and the Swirl Dominated Flow in the RNG options were also used. An enhanced two-layer wall treatment was employed for the prediction of aerosol deposition [24] . Wall unit adaptation was applied in wall-adjacent cells when creating the meshes to ensure that the values of the wall unit y + meet the requirements of the enhanced wall treatment [22] . The turbulent dispersion and the random walking of the aerosols are also considered by using the Thermophoretic Force and the Brownian Motion options in the DPM model. To simulate human movement, the layering meshing scheme of the dynamic mesh method was used [13, 17, 28] . The whole mesh domain was split into two mesh zones: stationary zone and dynamic zone [11] , as shown in Figure 1 . The surfaces between the static mesh zone and the dynamic mesh zone are set as grid interfaces. The grid sizes on the two sides of the interfaces are different. The maximum mesh size for the static mesh zones and the dynamic mesh zones is 0.03 m and 0.05 m, respectively. The data exchange in the interface between the static and dynamic mesh domains was realized by the grid interface principles for the sliding mesh theory [11] . The semi-implicit method for pressure-linked equations (SIMPLE) algorithm was employed to solve the pressure-velocity coupling equations in the steady-state. The Pressure-Implicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm was employed for transient simulation. The second order upwind scheme was used for the treatment of the convection and diffusion-convection terms in the governing equation. The method used to simulate human movement has been verified by experimental and numerical investigations [29] .

The airflow pattern in this airplane cabin was first simulated in the steady-state. The inlet velocity was 2.994 m/s, corresponding to 9.7 L/s/person. The air exchange rate for the supply inlet conditions was 36.52ACH. The boundary conditions are shown in Table 2 [8, 18, 19, 22] . The effects of the human thermal plume on the airflow motion was also considered and numerical simulated in the computational geometry. The surface temperature of the seated passengers was numerical set, following the method given by previous studies [18, 19, 22] . Since the inhalation and exhalation airflow velocity in the breathing zone of the person was small [30, 31] , the influence of the respiration on aerosols transmission can be regarded as insignificant. So the personal respirations of the passengers were not simulated in this work [18] . For the respiratory activities of the index patient, breathing and cough is very common for SARS infector. According to previous studies, the droplets expelled by breathing are much smaller and fewer than that of coughing [32] . So in this work, coughing was considered as the main aerosol release process of the index patient, and the dissemination process of the coughing droplets were numerical simulated.

To simulate a cough, aerosol injections were employed right at the mouth of the index patient. According to experimental measurements of cough droplets, the quantity of the droplets smaller than 3 μm was quite small, and the droplets larger than 100 μm might fall down to the ground immediately after they were expelled [33, 34] . So in this work, the original size range of the aerosols was 3 μm~112 μm and ten size classes were used to simulate the size distribution. In enclosed environment, the evaporation effects will strongly influence the size and mass of the droplets [32] . Considering that the equilibrium diameter after evaporation was 50% of the original size [35] , the size range of the aerosol injections was 1.5~56 μm and the size distribution followed the experimental results given by Duguid [34] . The particles number of each size class was set as 50,000 and the total number of the particles of the ten size classes was 500, 000, follows the aerosol setup used by previous studies [18, 22] . The total volume of this computational geometry is larger than that of Reference [22] (30 m 3 ) and smaller than that of Reference [18] (97 m 3 ), thus the total number of the particles used in this numerical simulation can be considered as enough for this study. This number would be converted to the original number according to the size distribution of cough for infection risk assessment. The size distribution of the droplets used in the numerical simulation is shown in Table 3 . The coughing direction was 45 degree downwards (0, 1, −1). When the index patient coughs, the open area of his mouth was 9.68 cm 2 . The velocity of the exhaled airflow was set according to the experimental results to approximately simulate a cough [19] .

In this airplane section, the airflow pattern in the steady-state was simulated and used as the initial condition. Then, five cases under different human movement pattern assumptions were investigated. Case 1~3 were used to simulate the cough when the index patient was seated at 9E, which is also the injection location. A no-movement case was used to simulate the aerosol dispersion in the airplane cabin without human movement. Two more cases were simulated to study the aerodynamic effects of human movement, in which the standing person started to move along the aisle 1 s after the aerosol injections at moving speeds of 0.5 m/s and 1.0 m/s, corresponding to stroll and normal walking, respectively. Case 4 and 5 simulated and compared the aerosol dispersion when the index patient walked in the airplane at 0.5 m/s and coughed at 3 s and 6 s after the Back and front surface Periodic Escape movement began, respectively. Since the aisle in the Boeing airplane is much longer than this computational geometry and the moving person may moves from a further area outside this computational geometry, the walking speed of the moving person can be assumed remain the same during the movement in this computational geometry [9] . The walking speed profile of the moving person is an even-speed profile [8] . The investigated cases are given in Table 4 .

In the numerical simulation, the time step was 0.1 s for t ≤ 10s and 0.2 s for t > 10s when the standing person was not moving. During human movement, the time step was 0.1 s for moving speed of 0.5 m/s and 0.05 s for 1.0 m/s. Each case was computed in a 4-node Linux cluster. Each node of the cluster had eight processors (2.4 GHz Intel 64) and 16 GB of memory. The calculation time of each case was 180-220 hours, depending on the total number of time steps and iterations.

Based on the results of CFD simulation, the infection risks of the occupants were investigated by using the dose-response model in the risk assessment [36] . The exposure levels of the passengers were assessed according to the concept of intake fraction [18, 37] , which demonstrated the fraction of the quantity of pathogens deposited on the target infection site in the respiratory tract to the total quantity of pathogens produced by the index patient [38] :

where D(x,t) is the intake fraction of the susceptible passengers for one cough.

x is the spatial location c is the pathogen concentration in the expiratory fluid, 10 6 pfu/ ml for the SARS-CoV [39] . p is the pulmonary ventilation rate, 7.5 l/min [18] . f(t) is the viability function of pathogens in the aerosols. Since the SARS-CoV may retain its infectivity for minutes and gradual loss for as long as several days [40, 41] , the viability function of the SARS-CoV is taken as 75% after aerosolization and remains the same during the first a few minutes [22, 40, 41] . m is the total number of size bins. N c is the total quantity of pathogens produced in a cough, N c = V c c, where V c is the total volume of the droplets produced in a cough, 6.7 × 10 -3 ml [18, 42] h l is the ratio of the number of droplets of the lth size bin in a cough to the number of injected particles in the numerical model, in which the number of droplets of the lth size bin can be calculated according to the original size distribution of the cough and V c . v(x,t) is the volume density of expiratory droplets in the breathing zone of the subject induced by one cough, ml/l of air. The breathing zone of each passenger can be defined as a hemisphere with 0.3 m radius at the nose [18] . For the human model used in this work, the volume of the breathing zone is 0.005721 m 3 for each passenger. Then v(x,t) can be calculated according to the CFD simulation results as the total volume of all the expiratory droplets in the breathing zone divided by the volume of the breathing zone [43] . β l is the respiratory deposition fraction of the aerosols of the lth size bin, %, which can be calculated according to the size and deposition location of the aerosols [44] . According to the infection mechanism of SARS, the human angiotensin 1-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) has been confirmed to be the receptor of the SARS-CoV. The hACE2 can be detected in ciliated airway epithelial cells of human airway tissues derived from nasal and tracheobronchial regions. And the infectivity of the SARS-CoV on the ciliated airway epithelial cells derived from nasal and tracheobronchial regions shows no difference [45] . So the aerosols that deposit in the head airway and tracheobronchial regions of the respiratory tract can be accounted in the intake dose [44] . It was tedious and time-consuming to model every cough during the exposure time interval to obtain v(x,t) at different locations. Considering other aerodynamic size-dependent factors, a stochastic non- Table 4 The cases investigated in the numerical simulation threshold dose-response model for airborne pathogens can be formed [38] :

where P I is the infection risk of the susceptible passenger after the flight, which demonstrates the infection possibility of the susceptible passenger; t 0 is the exposure time interval of the flight, hr; f s is the cough frequency, 18/hr [46] ; r l is the infectivity of pathogens in the droplets of the lth size bin; and r is the integrated infectivity factor for all pathogens. For the SARS-CoV, the infectivity of pathogens contained in the droplets of different size classes show no differences, hence the infectivity r l can be expressed as r. According to the experiments on mice for the development of vaccine, efficient replication of the virus is found in the respiratory tract of the mice after they are administered at a very low dose of the SARS-CoV [47, 48] , indicating high infectivity of the SARS-CoV. Since no other infectivity data is found, the infectivity factor r is assumed as 1 per pfu of virus in this work because of the high infectivity of the SARS-CoV. In Eq. (2), N c f s t 0 D(x, t 0 ) can also be regarded as the intake dose of the passenger. To evaluate the effects of different human movement behaviors, the intake fractions of the seated passengers can be expressed as followed:

where D(x,t) is the intake fraction of the susceptible passenger, which is defined in Eq. (1) and used in Eq. (2); D q (x,t) is the intake fraction of the susceptible passenger for the qth movement behavior; and a q is the possibility of the qth movement behavior; X q a q ¼ 1.

In the risk assessment approach, average or assumed values were used for the input parameters of Eq. (1) and (2), e.g. the pathogen generation rate of the index patient. In the actual outbreak case, the values of these parameters may be different from the average values because of the individual differences of the index patients. These differences may significantly increase the uncertainty of the risk assessment results. So the likelihood analysis was performed as a hypothesis test on the input parameters and assess which human movement pattern assumption was most likely to be the actual case [49] . During the estimation of likelihood, the uncertainties of the unknown parameters were all considered in the quanta generation rate. The quanta generation rate was the generation rate of the infective pathogens, which can be regarded as the multiple of the infectivity factor to the pathogen generation rate (rN c f s , hr − 1 ), as described in Sze To & Chao [36] . While the risk assessment provided quantitative information on how did human movement affect the infection risks of the passengers, the likelihood analysis served as a better tool to estimate the unknown information in the actual outbreak case.

In the likelihood analysis, all the susceptible passengers were divided into several groups, and passengers with similar intake fractions were grouped in the same group. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) was then determined to identify the value of quanta generation rate that was most likely to be the true value [49] . The case with the MLE can be regarded as the case that best fits the outcome of the outbreak. The likelihood can be estimated as followed:

where L r p I;s 

where L r p I ð Þ À is the average relative likelihood; S is the total number of the divided groups; N s is the total number of susceptible people in the sth group; L r p I;s À is the relative likelihood of the sth group; p I;s À is the average infection risk of the sth group; and n s is number of infected people in the sth group.

In this work, the steady-state airflow pattern in the cabin was used as the initial condition for the transient simulation. In steady-state, the cold air comes into the airplane cabin from the supply inlets, flows downward and sideward through the cabin and exits from the outlets located at the bottom of the sidewalls. No symmetrical recirculation zone exists, unlike the airflow pattern in the twin-aisle airplane [18, 19, 22] . Downward airflow can be found on both sides of the aisle, which is induced by the ventilation system. The human thermal plume is not apparent because of the significant downward airflow induced by the ventilation system. The heat effects of the human body can influence the temperature distribution in the local area around the human body. The influence area of these downward airflow is also larger than that of the respiratory exhalation flows of the seated passengers, which indicates that the influence of the personal respiratory exhalation flows of the seated passengers on the airflow field is insignificant comparing with that induced by the ventilation system. When the standing person moves along the aisle, the airflow pattern in the airplane is affected by human movement, similar to the results given by previous studies [8, 11] . Significant downward airflow exists in the wake behind the torso, which enhances the downward movement of the room air induced by the ventilation system. Hence human movement can disturb the air distribution in a local region and influence the airflow motion in the airplane cabin. More details about the airflow pattern in the airplane cabin, and discussions on the human thermal plume and the effects of human movement on the flow field can be found in the Additional file 1.

To demonstrate the effects of human movement on aerosol dispersion in the airplane cabin, Figure 2 gives the timing diagrams of the average position of all the aerosols for case 1~3 in X direction (lateral position), Y direction (longitudinal position) and Z direction (vertical position), respectively. The average position is the average value of the absolute positions of all the airborne aerosols at time t.

From Figure 2 (a), similar trends can be found for all cases. The average lateral positions first increase to 3.61 m in 0.8 s after the injections and then keep decreasing. Higher moving speeds lead to a slower decreasing rate. In the computational geometry, the index patient was seated at X = 3.585 m and the position of the centerline was X = 2.29 m. So Figure 2 (a) suggest that the airflow induced by human movement will slightly prevent the aerosols from moving across the aisle of the airplane cabin. Figure 2(b) shows that the average longitudinal position keeps increasing after the injections for case 1~3. Since the airflow from front to back of the cabin (longitudinal direction) is minimal [6, 7] , the longitudinal movement of the aerosols of case 1 is mainly due to the initial momentum given by the cough. Figure 2 (b) also indicates that human movement may enhance the mixing of room air in the airplane cabin, which may result in the transport of the aerosols along the moving path in both the positive and negative longitudinal direction, not only following the coughing direction or the moving direction. This is also proven by the results of Exposure assessment shown in Section 3.3, in which the aerosol concentrations in the breathing zones of the passengers who are seated ahead and behind the index patient will increase after the movement of the standing person. As shown in Figure 2 (c), the average vertical position of case 1 remains at about 1.20 m and starts to fluctuate after 25 s. But for case 2 and 3, it keeps decreasing and is lower than 0.5 m after 40 s. So human movement may cause the suspended aerosols to fall down to the ground and result in a downward transport effect. During human walking, apparent downwash flow and downward contaminant transport can be found in the wake behind the torso of the human body [9] . Thus the downward transport of the aerosols may be mainly due to flow characteristics of the wake behind the human body. In an airplane cabin, not only the ventilation system but also the wake of a moving human can strengthen the downward transport of the aerosols. Higher moving speed may have a stronger downward transport effect.

From Figure 2 (a)~(c), apparent and fierce fluctuation trend of the average position can be found for case 1 in all of the three directions when t > 30 s. Fluctuation can also be found for case 2 after t > 40 s, which is not as fierce as that of case 1. This fluctuation is because the number of the suspended aerosols is too small [22] . Hence Figure 2 also suggests that human movement may influence the number of the suspended aerosols as well as the deposition and removal of the aerosols. To demonstrate the effects of human movement on deposition and removal of the aerosols, Figure 3 shows the suspended fraction of all the aerosols for case 1~3. This suspended fraction is the ratio of the number of the aerosols remained airborne to the total number of injected aerosols. As shown in Figure 3 , the suspended fractions of case 1~3 keep decreasing. For higher moving speed, the suspended fraction decreases more slowly. For case 1, when t ≥ 27.2 s, the number of the aerosols remained airborne is less than 500 and the suspended fraction is less than 10 −3 . When t ≥ 39.6 s, the suspended fraction is less than 10 −4 . For case 2, the number of the aerosols remained airborne is larger than 500 until t = 37.2 s and the suspended fraction remains larger than 10 −4 even after 50 s after the injections. For case 3, there are still more than 900 aerosols remained airborne after 50 s after the injections, and the suspended fraction remains larger than 10 −3 . This result indicates that the turbulence effects, which are induced by the movement of the standing person, can significantly lower the deposition and removal rate of the aerosols and influence the fluctuation of the average positions of the suspended aerosols. In case 1~3, more than 99% of the aerosols are deposited in the cabin. So the movement of the standing person does not significantly change the total deposition fraction of the aerosols.

To demonstrate the effects of human movement on the deposition and removal of the aerosols of different size, Figure 4 gives the relationship between suspended fraction and aerosol size for case 1~3, respectively. Similar to Figure 3 , Figure 4 shows that the suspended fractions of all aerosol sizes decrease quickly. For case 1, at 30 s after the injections, the suspended fractions of all aerosol sizes are smaller than 10 −3 . For case 2, the suspended fractions of the aerosols smaller than 18 μm remain larger than 10 −3 until 43 s after the injections. For case 3, the suspended fractions of the aerosols smaller than 22 μm are still larger than 10 −3 even after 50 s after the injections. So the movement of the standing person can significantly lower the deposition and removal rates of all aerosol sizes. From Figure 4 (a)~(c), similarity can also be found between the characteristics of the deposition and removal rates of different aerosol sizes. The suspended fractions of larger aerosols decrease more quickly than that of smaller aerosols. These characteristics are not affected by human movement.

Based on the simulation results, the number of expiratory droplets in the breathing zone of each passenger can be obtained according to the locations of the suspended aerosols and the breathing zone. Then the volume density of expiratory droplets v(x,t) can be calculated and the intake fraction can also be obtained by using Eq. (1). Figure 5 shows the exposure levels of eighteen selected passengers from line 1~12 and seat A~F for case 1~3, including seven passengers infected with SARS after the flight (passenger 2C, 5E, 7D, 8E, 9B, 11B and 12B) and eleven healthy passengers (passenger 1D, 3E, 4C, 6D, 7 F, 8A, 9A, 10B, 10D, 11 F and 12C). The exposure level is demonstrated by the relative intake dose, which is the intake fraction of the passenger in each time step. The seating plan of the passengers can be found in Figure 1 . Figure 5 shows that the relative intake dose of each passenger is significantly different for different moving speeds. Even the passengers seated 8 rows ahead or 3 rows behind the index patient are affected by the movement. Hence the volume density distribution of expiratory droplets in the airplane cabin and the relative intake dose of each passenger can be significantly influenced by human movement. Figure 6 demonstrates the intake fraction distribution induced by one cough in the airplane cabin for case 13 , respectively. Passengers who are seated close to the index patient (especially for row 7-10, seat D-F) have much higher intake fractions than other passengers. The intake fractions of the passengers seated on the right side of the moving person (seat D-F) are slightly higher than that on the left side (seat A-C). Lower intake fractions can be found from the passengers seated far away from the index patient (row 1-4). Comparing Figure 6 (a)~(c), differences can be found in the intake fraction of every passenger. After human movement, more than half of the passengers will have higher intake fractions (41 passengers for case 2 and 38 for case 3). Compared with case 1, the variation range of the intake fractions is −91%~+472% for case 2 and −99%~+255% for case 3. The average intake fraction of all the 71 seated passenger (with the index patient and the moving person excluded) is 1.69 × 10 −6 , 1.75 × 10 −6 and 1.91 × 10 −6 for case 1~3. That means the movement of the standing person may lead to a 3.3%9

.3% increase in the average intake fraction. Besides, some of the passengers seated 2-3 rows behind and 4-7 rows in front of the index patient may also have lower intake fractions after the movement. Thus the variation of the intake fractions also depends on the location of the passengers and the index patient. Besides, although the intake fractions of the passengers are changed by the movement of the standing person, no significant differences can be found between the distribution characteristics of the intake fractions of different cases. Passengers seated farther away from the index patient have much lower intake fractions.

The walking person also has a non-negligible exposure level. Figure 7 gives a thirty-second time profile of the relative intake dose of the moving person for moving speeds of 0.5 m/s and 1.0 m/s (case 2 and 3). As shown in Figure 7 , the relative intake dose of the moving person increases quickly after the person starts to move (t ≥ 1 s). The peak value appears at t = 5 s and t = 3 s for case 2 and 3, corresponding to a moving distance of 2 m, where the moving person is quite close to the index patient. Figure 7 also indicates a high relative intake dose during the movement (t = 2.5~7 s for 0.5 m/s and t = 25 s for 1.0 m/s), when the moving person walks through the region with high aerosol concentration (row 6-11). So a passenger or a crew member will receive a high intake dose if he/she walks through the aisle when the index patient is coughing.

By using the risk assessment, the influence of human movement on infectious disease transmission can be analyzed and compared. According to Eq. (2), the infection risk of each passenger after the 3-hour flight can be calculated for case 1~3. For case 2 and 3, the infection risk is calculated under the assumption that the moving person walks in the airplane frequently during the flight and he/she will walk through the aisle during each cough of the index patient. Figures 8 and 9 demonstrate the average infection risk per passenger in the airplane cabin for case 1~3. Figure 8 is the average of the infection risk of the six passengers seated in the same row (row 1~12), and Figure 9 is the average of the twelve passengers seated in the same line of seats (seat A~F). In Figures 8 and 9 , the calculated infection risk of the index patient is excluded since he is already infected. As shown in Figure 8 , the infection risks of the passengers close to the index patient (row 8-10) are much higher than others. Further area has a lower infection risk, except for row 1 and 2 where the moving person stops. From Figure 8 , it also can be seen that the average infection risk of each row is affected by human movement. The movement of the standing person increases the average infection risk in row 6-8 (three rows in front of the index patient), row 9 (the same row of the index patient), row 10 (one row behind the index patient) and row 1 (where the moving person stops). For other areas, whether the movement can increase the infection risk depends on the moving speed. As shown in Figure 9 , the average infection risk of the passengers in seat B~D will increase after human movement. The average infection risk of the passengers in seat A will also increase when the moving speed is 0.5 m/s. This result indicates that human movement may influence the infection risk distribution in the airplane cabin and lead to increases in the infection risks of more than half of the passengers.

With the moving person and the index patient excluded, the average infection risk of all the seated passengers is 0.2015, 0.2051 and 0.2096 for case 1~3, respectively. This result also proves that human movement may increase the infection risk in the airplane cabin. Especially, in case 2 and 3, the infection risk of the moving person is 0.55 for moving speed of 0.5 m/s and 0.51 for 1.0 m/s, significantly higher than most of the seated passengers (62 passengers for case 2 and 58 for case 3). This result indicates that the infection possibilities of the crew members (who need to walk in the airplane cabin frequently during the flight) may be even higher than 50%. For the seated passengers, walking along the aisle (e.g. go to the washroom) and passing through the high-dose region (around the index patient) may also significantly increase their intake doses and result in much higher infection risks.

In the risk assessment, an assumed value of 1 was used for the infectivity of SARS-CoV, and average values were used for the total quantity of pathogens produced in a cough. These average or assumed values might lead to uncertainties in the risk assessment results. In the likelihood analysis, all these uncertain variables were included in the quanta generation rate term, while the case that best fits the outcome of the real outbreak case was identified by the MLE [49] . As shown in Table 5 , the passengers are arranged into four groups (with the index patient excluded) according to their intake fractions obtained in the exposure assessment of case 1~3 (Figure 6 ), respectively. In the outbreak case, 17 of the 71 passengers involved in this investigation region are infected with SARS. They are also given in Table 5 and used in the likelihood analysis. By using Eq. (4), the likelihood values under a range of quanta generation rates (1~10 9 hr − 1 ) are obtained for case 1~3, as shown in Figure 10 . The estimated quanta generation rate of the index patient in the outbreak case is 0.141 million, 0.103 million and 0.127 million for case 1~3, respectively. The likelihood of the no movement case is significantly larger than case 2 and 3 (0.414 comparing with 0.026 and 0.055). So case 1 best fits the infection pattern of the real case among case 1~3.

In case 2 and 3, it was assumed that the moving person would walk through the aisle at a constant speed during each cough of the index patient. However, all of the three movement behaviors (moving speed of 0, 0.5 and 1.0 m/s during each cough) might happen during the flight and the movement of the moving person may not be so frequently. To verify whether a combination of case 1~3 may be more likely to happen in the real case, a range of combinations of case 1~3 are also investigated in the likelihood analysis according to Eq. (3):

where D 1 (x,t), D 2 (x,t) and D 3 (x,t) are the intake fractions of the susceptible passengers for case 1~3, respectively, which are calculated by Eq.

(2) and shown in Figure 6 ; a 1 and a 2 are the rates that demonstrate how often the moving person walks in the airplane at moving speeds of 0.5 m/s and 1.0 m/s during the coughs of the index patient, a 1 + a 2 ≤1. By using likelihood analysis, the likelihood values under a range of quanta generation rate values, a 1 and a 2 can be obtained (data not shown). The result shows that the maximum likelihood is still 0.414 when the quanta generation rate is 0.141 million and both of a 1 and a 2 are zero. So the no movement assumption best represents the outbreak case. This result fits with the findings of a previous study, which analyzed a multi-drug resistant tuberculosis outbreak case in an airplane cabin by using likelihood analysis [18] . Yin et al. [18] did not simulate human movement but using a 'mixing ratio' concept to analyze the effect of human movement on the transmission of infectious disease. It was also found in the tuberculosis case that the likelihood reached maximum at mixing ratio close to zero, which indicated that human movement only had insignificant effect on the airborne transmission of respiratory infectious diseases.

As shown in Figure 7 , the moving person also receives a high intake dose and has a high exposure level. So, if a seated passenger walks in the airplane cabin (e.g. walking to the washroom) when the index patient is coughing, his/her exposure level will also significantly increase and result in a higher infection risk. This effect is also investigated in the likelihood analysis according to Eq. (3):

where D 2 (MP,t) and Figure 10 Likelihood values under a range of quanta generation rates for case 1~3.

airplane during a cough of the index patient is 1/71 = 0.014, which means b 1 + b 2 ≤0.014. By using likelihood analysis, the likelihood values under a range of quanta generation rate, b 1 and b 2 can be obtained (data not shown). The maximum likelihood is 0.763, when the quanta generation rate is 1.36 million, b 1 is 0.014 and b 2 is zero. This likelihood value is much higher than that of the previous cases. So, the risk assessment results will better fit the real case when the movement of the seated passengers is considered. An average walking possibility of 1.4% can be used to represent and simulate the movement behaviors of all the seated passengers.

According to the risk assessment results, the average infection risk of all the seventy-one seated passengers increases by 1.7%~2.2% due to human movement. So the frequent walking of the crew members or the passengers will raise the infection risk level in the airplane cabin. However, a 1.7%~2.2% increase is not so significant. By estimating the likelihoods of a series of human movement assumptions, the no movement case has the highest likelihood and is most likely to be the real case. This conclusion fits with the estimated results given by a previous study which stated that no human movement is the most probable case [18] . This result does not imply that there is no human movement in the real outbreak case, which is impossible. The crew members or the passengers may still walk frequently in the airplane when the index patient is not coughing. It needs to be emphasized that although the no movement case is the most likely case in this outbreak case, the conclusion may not be generalized to all outbreak cases because the numerical simulation and the risk assessment are casedependent.

The moving person also has a significantly high intake dose. When walking through the aisle during the coughing of the index patient, the moving person may receive an intake fraction of 2.2 × 10 −6 , which is larger than that of 80% of the seated passengers. Especially, for the passengers who are seated far away from the index patient, the intake fractions that they received during walking in the airplane cabin can be O(10 2 ) larger than that without movement. If a seated passenger walks in the airplane and passes through the high-dose region close to the index patient, he/she may also receive a significantly high intake dose. Frequent walking of the seated passengers may also result in a high infection risk, which may be up to 55%. After considering the movement behaviors of the seated passengers in the risk assessment and likelihood analysis, a much higher likelihood is estimated. So the walking activities of the seated passengers may be another explanation of the infection of the passengers seated far away from the index patient. This result indicates that the movements of the seated passengers also have a strong influence on the infection risk distribution in the airplane cabin. Taking the influence of human movement into consideration is still necessary and important for the infection control in enclosed environment.

The droplets dispersion and disease transmission in the airplane cabin are also highly depended on the behavior characteristics of the index patient, e.g. the index patient coughs during walking along the aisle or standing and waiting outside the lavatory. Figure 11 demonstrates the intake fraction distribution induced by one cough in the airplane cabin for case 4~5. The index patient was walking (e.g. towards the lavatory) and coughed at different location. Same as the intake fraction distribution shown in Figure 6 , local area around the index patient has a significantly higher intake dose than further area. The intake fraction and the infection risk of each passenger is mainly depended on the distance between the passenger and the cough location. Thus, if the index patient coughs during walking in the aisle or waiting outside the lavatory, another high-dose region will be formed around the current location of the index patient, rather than the seat location (9E). The frequent walking of the index patient may influence the infection risk distribution in the airplane cabin and increase the infection risk of the passengers who are seated far from the seat location of the index patient. Passengers who are seated close to the lavatory may also have significantly high infection risks for the index patient may need to use the lavatory frequently. Thus the infection risk distribution in the airplane cabin is also highly depended on the behavior characteristics of the index patient. The risk assessment results will be more accurate when considering the droplets dispersion process under different walking activities of the index patient. So a better understanding and estimation of the behavior characteristics of the index patient will be very important and useful for infection risk assessment and control in airplane cabin.

Uncertainties and errors still exist in this work. In the risk assessment and the likelihood estimation, an average walking possibility is used for all the seated passengers. This is not accurate because each individual may have a unique behavioral characteristic. So investigations on behavioral characteristics of the occupants in the airplane are strongly needed. And also, only the coughing droplets are numerical simulated in this study. Droplets expelled by breathing and sneezing can also influence the infection risk of each individual. An aerosol source model that takes the droplets expelled by multiple respiratory activities into account may also be helpful for better evaluating the aerosol disseminate process in the airplane cabin. The pathogen concentration in the expiratory fluid was considered as constant in this work. Since the volume concentration of the virus varies with the size of the cough droplets, changes of the pathogen concentration in the droplets of different size may also influence the risk assessment results [50] . Besides, the re-suspension of the aerosols is not considered in this work. During human walking, the movement may lead to the re-suspension of the aerosols from the floor. When taking the re-suspension of the exhaled droplets into consideration, the risk assessment results will be more accurate. However, since the airflow induced by the ventilation system is downward to the outlet (located on the side wall and close to the floor), the re-suspended aerosols can hardly rise to the breathing level of the seated passengers. So the effects of the re-suspended aerosols on the risk assessment results can be considered as insignificant in this case.

In this work, the influence of human movement on airborne disease transmission in an airplane cabin is investigated. An on-flight outbreak case of SARS is chosen to demonstrate the risk assessment process. The Eulerian-Lagrangian approach is used to simulate the dispersion and deposition of infectious droplets expelled by the index patient. The simulation result shows that human movement improves the mixing of the air in the airplane cabin, strengthens the downward transport of the aerosols, and decreases the deposition and removal rate of the aerosols.

The infection risks of the occupants are assessed by using the dose-response model in infection risk assessment. The average infection risk of the seated passengers is 0.2015, 0.2051 and 0.2096 for no human movement, moving speeds of 0.5 m/s and 1.0 m/s, respectively. The assessment result shows that human movement may increase the average infection risk in the cabin, especially for the passengers seated three rows ahead and one row behind the index patient. The likelihood of each case is estimated and the highest likelihood can be found in the no movement case with a quanta generation rate of 0.141 million. So in this SARS outbreak case, the effect of human movement on airborne disease transmission, as it changes the dispersion and mixing pattern of infectious expiratory aerosol, is found to be very insignificant. Since the numerical simulation and the risk assessment are case-dependent, this result may not be generalized to all cases. Moreover, if the seated passengers walk in the airplane cabin, the intake doses of that passengers may also significantly increase and lead to a high infection risks. So the movements of the seated passengers also have a strong influence on the airborne disease transmission in the airplane cabin and may result in significantly higher infection risks for the moving persons.

The results of this work imply that the infection risk distribution in the airplane cabin highly depends on the movement behaviors of the passengers and the index patient. Taking the influence of the movement of the seated passengers into consideration is necessary. A better understanding and estimation of the behavior characteristics of the index patient is also important for infection risk assessment and control in airplane cabin. To reduce the pathogen concentration in the high-dose region close to the index patient, a personal ventilation system may be a feasible solution which is still needed to be carefully designed and verified in airplane cabin operation. Using N95 respirator masks of the index patient or the passengers can also be a simple and viable method to prevent exposure from inhalation the expiratory aerosols. In future studies, investigations on the behaviors characteristics of the passengers during flight will be useful and helpful for infection control. 

Administration of molecular hydrogen during pregnancy improves behavioral abnormalities of offspring in a maternal immune activation model OPEN

The aim of the present study was to investigate long-term outcomes of the offspring in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced maternal immune activation (MIA) model and the effect of maternal molecular hydrogen (H 2 ) administration. We have previously demonstrated in the MIA mouse model that maternal administration of H 2 attenuates oxidative damage and neuroinflammation, including induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and microglial activation, in the fetal brain. Short-term memory, sociability and social novelty, and sensorimotor gating were evaluated using the Y-maze, threechamber, and prepulse inhibition (PPI) tests, respectively, at postnatal 3 or 4 weeks. The number of neurons and oligodendrocytes was also analyzed at postnatal 5 weeks by immunohistochemical analysis. Offspring of the LPS-exposed dams showed deficits in short-term memory and social interaction, following neuronal and oligodendrocytic loss in the amygdala and cortex. Maternal H 2 administration markedly attenuated these LPS-induced abnormalities. Moreover, we evaluated the effect of H 2 on LPS-induced astrocytic activation, both in vivo and in vitro. The number of activated astrocytes with hypertrophic morphology was increased in LPS-exposed offspring, but decreased in the offspring of H 2 -administered dams. In primary cultured astrocytes, LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines were attenuated by H 2 administration. Overall, these findings indicate that maternal H 2 administration exerts neuroprotective effects and ameliorates MIA-induced neurodevelopmental deficits of offspring later in life.

Published: xx xx xxxx OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 2 ScIENtIfIc REPORTS | (2018) 8:9221 | lead to direct and indirect death or dysfunction of neuronal and oligodendrocyte cells 10 , which are considered to be the main targets of fetal brain injury 11 .

We have previously suggested that the maternal administration of molecular hydrogen (H 2 ) plays a neuroprotective role in the fetal brain against injury caused by oxidative stress and inflammation 12-14 . Ohsawa et al. discovered that H 2 acts as an antioxidant that selectively neutralizes hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and protects the brain from injury 15 . H 2 reacts with strong oxidants, such as •OH, but remains mild enough to neither disturb the metabolic redox reactions nor affect ROS signaling. Several subsequent studies have explored the therapeutic and preventive effects of H 2 , and have indicated that H 2 has other properties as well, including anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects 16, 17 . The safety and some promising benefits of H 2 have already been demonstrated, not only in animal models but also in patients, including those with Parkinson's disease 18 , diabetes mellitus 19 and mild cognitive impairment 20 , although no large randomized controlled trials have been conducted to date. Recently, we demonstrated that the administration of H 2 to pregnant mouse dams significantly increased H 2 concentration in the fetal brain, through the maternal-fetal interface, in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced MIA 12 . Fetal damage in this MIA model and the effect of maternal H 2 administration on this damage can be summarized as follows 12 : (1) high mortality rate of MIA fetuses, (2) brain injury associated with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, aberrant microglial activation, and oxidative damage in the MIA fetal brains, and (3) attenuation of these adverse outcomes by maternal H 2 administration. Thus, the protective effect of maternal H 2 administration on short-term outcomes in the MIA offspring has been demonstrated. However, long-term outcomes of the surviving offspring are yet to be investigated. Therefore, the present study investigated long-term neurological outcomes in the MIA mouse model and the efficacy of H 2 administration in pregnant dams, using both histological and behavioral examinations. Astrocytes, which are the most abundant cell population in the CNS, play a key role in normal brain development 21, 22 . However, when astrocytes are exposed to maternally-derived cytokines in MIA models, they secrete various cytokines that lead to neurodevelopmental impairments 23 . Moreover, activation of astrocytes is known to be a factor in the prolongation of brain damage, and contributes to the formation of glial scars that limit neuronal plasticity 24 . Thus, in the present study, the MIA-related astrocytic activation and its modification by H 2 administration were also investigated, both in vivo and in vitro.

Maternal H 2 administration restored offspring growth. We investigated postnatal growth, which could be related to neurologic outcome. From postnatal day (P) 6 to P10, offspring growth was significantly retarded in the LPS group than in the Control group (p < 0.05). Although significant differences were not observed between the LPS and LPS + HW group, maternal administration of Hydrogen water (HW) restored offspring growth to the control level (Fig. 1) .

The association between maternal immune activation (MIA) and subsequent neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring has become increasingly recognized, with both epidemiological evidence and research findings in various animal models [1] [2] [3] [4] . MIA against viral or bacterial infections influences the developing fetal central nervous system (CNS), and increases the risk of schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) later in life [5] [6] [7] . It has been suggested that MIA has a strong impact on microglial development, and microglial disturbance disrupts neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and myelination, thus leading to consequent impairments in the brain function of the offspring 2 . Based on these findings, MIA is believed to be a disease primer 1 . It has also been reported that MIA and MIA-induced fetal neuroinflammation stimulate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and disturbances in pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the fetal brain 8, 9 . These changes are reported to Maternal H 2 administration attenuated the behavioral deficits induced by LPS exposure. Since MIA has been considered to be a cause of behavioral abnormalities in offspring, including ASD/ Schizophrenia-like behavior, we subsequently evaluated the effect of LPS and maternal administration of HW on short-term memory, sociability, social novelty, and sensorimotor gating. As shown in Fig. 2A , spontaneous alternation was markedly reduced in the LPS group than in the Control group (p < 0.001) in the Y-maze test, which is indicative of impaired short-term memory. Treatment with H 2 significantly attenuated the LPS-induced impairment of short-term memory (p < 0.05). There was no difference in the total number of arm entries among the three groups (Control, 24.0 ± 1.3; LPS, 22.6 ± 0.61; HW + LPS, 22.7 ± 0.91).

In order to investigate social behaviors, we evaluated sociability and preference for social novelty in the three-chambered social test. During the habituation phase, the mice in each group spent equal amounts of time exploring both compartments, with no biased preference for either of the two empty cylinders (data not shown). During the sociability phase, the mice in each group demonstrated a preference for spending more time in the chamber containing an unfamiliar mouse (stranger 1) relative to the opposite, empty chamber. However, the LPS-treated offspring approached the chamber containing stranger 1 significantly less frequently than the Control and HW + LPS groups (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively; Fig. 2C ). During the social novelty preference phase, the mice in each group showed a significant preference for the new, unfamiliar mouse (stranger 2) over the previous, now familiar, mouse (stranger 1). However, the LPS-treated offspring approached the chamber containing the stranger 2 significantly less frequently than the Control group (p < 0.01; Fig. 2D ). There was no difference between the LPS and the HW + LPS groups, although a trend toward attenuation of the LPS-induced reduction in the preference for social novelty was detected in the HW + LPS group.

The prepulse inhibition (PPI) test was performed to evaluate sensorimotor integration by measuring the startle response to administered acoustic pulses, however, no significant differences were detected among the groups (Fig. 2B ).

Maternal H 2 administration attenuated the LPS-induced neuronal loss. In our previous investigation, activated microglia was most accumulated in mainly temporal association area, 8 h after the LPS insult. Neurons in this area were reported to be related to sociability deficits 25 . In addition, the association between autism and amygdala, especially in Lateral amygdala 26, 27 , is well known. Moreover, the amygdala interacts with the hippocampus in relation to memory 28 . Based on those findings, we subsequently performed Nissl staining and evaluated the number of neurons in the amygdala, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus to investigate the brain regions related to the results of the behavioral deficits induced by LPS exposure. The quantitative results revealed significant reductions in the number of neurons in the amygdala and cerebral cortex in the LPS-treated offspring than in the Control group (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively; Fig. 3A , panels a,b,d,e and 3B), but not in the hippocampus (Fig. S1 ). The LPS-induced neuronal loss in the amygdala and cerebral cortex was improved in the HW + LPS group than in the LPS group (p < 0.05 and p < 0.05, respectively; Fig. 3A , panels c,f and 3B). Maternal H 2 administration attenuated LPS-induced oligodendrocytic loss and suppressed astrocytic activation. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of the brain injury due to MIA are incompletely understood; however, under prenatal inflammation, activated astrocyte was reported to have a potential cause an adverse effect on neurons and oligodendrocyte, which would result in the abnormal behaviors in later life 29 . The number of oligodendrocytes was evaluated by using Olig2, a transcription factor involved in the differentiation of cells in the oligodendroglial lineage, and a mature oligodendrocyte marker 30, 31 . Compared with the Control group, the number of Olig2-positive cells was clearly reduced in the white matter, amygdala, and cerebral cortex in the LPS group (p < 0.01, p < 0.05, and p < 0.05, respectively; Fig. 4A , panels a,b,d,e,g,h and 4C). H 2 treatment completely blocked the LPS-induced decrease of Olig2-positive cells in all three regions (p < 0.01, p < 0.05, and p < 0.01, respectively; Fig. 4A , panels c,f,i and 4C).

The hallmarks of astrocytic activation include the development of a hypertrophic morphology with fewer processes and upregulation of intermediate filament proteins, particularly glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) 32, 33 . In the Control group, some GFAP-positive cells were detected, most of which were in the resting state (Fig. 4B , panels a,d). Compared with the Control group, a significantly increased number of activated astrocytes, characterized by a large soma and fewer processes (thus obtaining a more rounded shape), was observed in the white matter and amygdala of the LPS-treated offspring (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively; Fig. 4B , panel b,e and 4D). To evaluate the hypertrophic soma, the cellular size of the astrocytes was also quantified by calculating the ratio of GFAP immunostained area to the number of GFAP-positive cells. Larger soma were observed in the white matter of LPS-exposed mouse brains (p < 0.05; Fig. 4B , panel b and 4E). Although the number of GFAP-positive cells was unchanged following H 2 treatment, the size of the GFAP-positive cells was significantly reduced in the white matter (p < 0.05; Fig. 4B , panel c and 4E), indicating a reduced number of reactive astrocytes by H 2 treatment. In the amygdala, the number of GFAP positive astrocytes in the HW + LPS group was significantly decreased (p < 0.01; Fig. 4B , panel f and 4D).

H 2 treatment suppressed LPS-induced activation in primary cultured astrocyte. Because the over-activation of immune cells, including astrocytes, could have an adverse effect on neurons with the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines 34 , we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of H 2 on astrocyte using primary cultured astrocyte. As shown in Fig. 5 , stimulation of astrocytes with LPS for three hours led to marked increases in tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) (p < 0.001), interleukin (IL)-1β (p < 0.001), and IL-6 (p < 0.001) mRNA expression. These increases in expression of TNF-α (p < 0.01), IL-1β (p < 0.001) and IL-6 (p < 0.05) were significantly attenuated by H 2 treatment. Altered gene expression patterns in primary cultured astrocytes from the Control group, the LPS group, and the HW + LPS group. As we previously described the gene expression profile of microglia 12 , differential gene expression patterns of astrocytes from newborn mice in the Control group, the LPS group, and the HW + LPS group were also observed (Tables S1-S4, Supplementary Information). These results suggest that H 2 might also influence the function not only of microglia but also of astrocytes via changes in gene expression.

For the first time, we have demonstrated that maternal H 2 administration improved MIA-induced neurological impairments of offspring, including short-term memory and social interaction at postnatal 3-5 weeks. Previously, we reported that maternal H 2 administration suppresses microglial activation in the same model. In the present study, H 2 also suppressed the activation of astrocytes, both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that H 2 exerts a protective role against MIA-induced neuroinflammation through the suppression of microglia and astrocytes. As a result, mature oligodendrocytes were restored and neurons were protected from damage, thus leading to improved long-term neurological outcomes following maternal H 2 administration. Prenatal exposure to LPS also resulted in a transient reduction in body weight of the offspring between P6 -P10, which was attenuated by maternal H 2 administration. This might be due to a change in the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis 35 . Deficient post-neonatal growth has been reported to contribute to poor neurologic outcome 36 , thus, the transient decrease of weight observed in this model might be related to the neurological impairments in the offspring.

On the basis of the epidemiological evidence, several translational rodent models have been established to investigate a potential causal relationship between MIA and ASD-like behavioral abnormalities 1 . Following the discovery, in the 1980s, of the increased risk of schizophrenia after maternal influenza infection 37 , models of viral-like immune activation by polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid (poly(I:C)) have been widely studied 33, 38, 39 . In addition, models of bacterial-like immune activation by LPS are also well known to precipitate inflammatory responses and behavioral abnormalities in offspring, similar to the poly(I:C) models 38 . However, with respect to neurotoxicity, LPS exposure may have a stronger effect on the fetal brain than poly(I:C) exposure 29 . Thus, the type of pathogen is important for the pattern of neurodevelopmental abnormalities of the offspring, and the timing and dose of the pathogen's administration, in addition to the strain or species, may also have an influence. The present model of prenatal exposure to LPS led to impairments in short-term memory and social interaction at 3 to 4 weeks after birth.

Alterations in short-term memory were demonstrated by the marked reduction in alternation behavior in the Y-maze test, which is consistent with previous reports 40, 41 and is a persistent finding in poly(I:C) models 38 . The Y-maze test is well known as a hippocampal-dependent short-term learning task. In our MIA model, a remarkable loss of neurons was observed in the amygdala and cerebral cortex of the offspring, but not in the hippocampus. The formation of memory is encoded in a broad network of cortical/subcortical regions including the hippocampus, cingulate cortex, and amygdala 42 . Moreover, the amygdala is directly connected to and dynamically interacts with the hippocampus in relation to memory 28 . Therefore, a decreased number of neurons in the amygdala and cerebral cortex could consequently result in short-term memory impairments. In this model, increased activation of astrocytes was observed in the white matter and amygdala, which be related to impaired short-term memory 28, 41 .

Previous reports have demonstrated a causal relationship between prenatal exposure to LPS and deficits in social behavior and sensorimotor gating in offspring 38, [43] [44] [45] [46] . In this model, the social behavior including sociability and social novelty preference was impaired. The number of oligodendrocytes in the amygdala, cerebral cortex, and white matter in the offspring was decreased, which is consistent with previous findings 47 ; and a reduced number of neurons in the amygdala and cortex was also observed. Strong evidence suggests a crucial involvement of the amygdala in social processing and social cognition in humans [48] [49] [50] , as well as in social behavior in animals [51] [52] [53] . A recent report also suggested an association between the function of the cortex and the amygdala, and social behavior 54 . Therefore, the social behavior impairment observed in the present study is compatible with the neuronal and oligodendrocytic loss in the amygdala and cortex. A locomotor test was not performed in this study, although we observed no apparent differences in speed of movement among all groups in the three-chamber social test. Interestingly, there were no remarkable differences in the PPI test in our MIA model, and sensorimotor gating was also normal in comparison with the Control group. A possible explanation for these results is that PPI abnormalities might occur following exposure to a pathogen at mid-gestation 55 , while impairments in short-term memory and social behavior might be independent of the timing of exposure to a pathogen 2 . Thus, the negative results of the PPI test might be due to the fact that in the present model, LPS exposure occurs at late gestation, on embryonic day 17 (E17). Impairments in short-term memory and social behavior are well described in schizophrenia and ASD 38, 56 . PPI impairments manifest primarily in adults with ASD 57 , and are not observed in children with ASD 58 . A recent study further suggested that sensorimotor gating is only impaired in certain ASD subgroups 59 , although it may be a globally common feature in schizophrenia 60 . Therefore, the present model may reflect ASD-like rather than schizophrenia-like behavioral impairments.

Several characteristics that are reported in human ASD brains were also observed in the present model, including neuronal loss in the amygdala and cerebral cortex 61 , and astrocytic activation in the white matter 62 . We and others have also previously demonstrated microglial activation, enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, including IL-6, and elevated oxidative damage in fetal brains 12, [63] [64] [65] . In the MIA model, microglia play a major role, along with astrocytes, in synaptic pruning and neural circuit formation 2 . In addition, a single injection of IL-6 is known to lead to the same behavioral abnormalities as those observed in the LPS models 66 (IL-6 is thought to be a key cytokine in the link between MIA and the behavioral deficits in the offspring 38 ). In our previous report, maternal H 2 administration reduced both the excessive microglial activation and the increased IL-6 levels in the MIA fetal brains 12 , which could ameliorate the behavioral deficits later in life. Previous studies in adult rodents reported that H 2 treatment could mitigate the behavioral dysfunctions, including short-term memory deficits, cognitive impairments, and depressive-like behaviors, by regulating inflammation and ROS production 67, 68 , which is in line with our current results. Moreover, the present study demonstrated that prenatal H 2 administration restored the MIA-induced neuronal and oligodendrocytic loss, and suppressed the excessive activation of astrocytes at postnatal 5 weeks. It was also shown that H 2 directly attenuated the LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, in primary cultured astrocytes. These cytokines are known to induce apoptosis in oligodendrocytes and hypomyelination in the neonatal rodent 69 . Thus, the suppressive effect of H 2 on both microglial and astrocytic activation would protect neurons and oligodendrocytes against LPS exposure.

The pathological mechanism by which MIA causes psychiatric diseases in offspring is completely unknown, however we speculate that the following steps may be involved 29, 70 . Intrauterine inflammation activates fetal microglia during the acute phase, and subsequently, microglia also activate astrocytes. In the chronic phase, microglial activation is attenuated, while astrocytes are continuously activated 29 . Both microglia and astrocytes are important for normal neurodevelopment, however under prenatal inflammation, they are activated, their function is altered, and they have an adverse effect on neurons and axons, with the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines 34 . Inflammation also prevents the maturation of oligodendroglial progenitor cells, followed by a reduction of the oligodendrocyte lineage 71, 72 . This reduction leads to axonal loss. The neuronal and axonal damage caused by microglia or astrocytes in the developing brain would result in the abnormal behavioral features in later life. In our model, we have previously reported over-activation of fetal microglia 8 h after the LPS insult 12 , and the present study demonstrated that activation of astrocytes continued even ~5 weeks after the insult. Moreover, the number of neurons and oligodendrocytes were reduced in the amygdala and white matter, respectively. We have previously reported that H 2 has a suppressive effect on microglial activation 12 , and the present study demonstrated that H 2 had a similar effect on astrocytes, as described above. From these findings, we speculate that H 2 would protect neurons and oligodendrocytes indirectly via suppression of the over-activation of immune cells, including microglia and astrocytes, which would result in a reduction of the behavioral abnormalities present in MIA offspring. However, in this study, a direct effect of H 2 on neurons and oligodendrocytes was not evaluated in vitro, thus, this possibility cannot be excluded.

Several limitations of this study should be noted. In the current MIA model, additional core features of ASD, including restricted and repetitive behavioral patterns, were not investigated 73 . Thus, the effect of maternal H 2 administration on these symptoms remains unknown. The sensorimotor gating abnormality may be evaluated at an older age than was described in the present model, however, this might require changing other factors including the timing of exposure. Since the mouse brain is not considered to be fully mature until 3 weeks of age 74 , the interpretation of the results of behavioral tests in the present study requires considerable caution. In addition, we could not avoid the detrimental effects of maternal separation required for the measurement of body weight on offspring development. However, the separation was performed similarly for the offspring in all three groups, thus any effect should be minimal, and consistent across groups. In humans, it is currently thought that the occurrence of multiple risk factors, including genetic mutations and postnatal exposure to inflammation or other environmental triggers, may be required for the onset of ASD 1, 38 . Before advancing the clinical application of H 2 , it should be investigated whether H 2 could exert similar effects in so called 'multi-hit' models. Finally, in the previous and present studies, maternal H 2 administration was performed prior to the LPS exposure; thus, the therapeutic potential of H 2 remains unclear. Therefore, it might be relevant to evaluate the therapeutic effects of H 2 by administering H 2 to dams after exposure to LPS and in offspring.

In conclusion, we have provided evidence that maternal H 2 administration reduced deficits in short-term memory and social interaction in the LPS-induced MIA model, and also demonstrated an attenuation of the LPS-induced neuronal and oligodendrocytic cell loss. Remarkably, the neuroprotective effect of H 2 appeared in the amygdala and cortex in this mouse model. The neuroprotection is thought to be due to the suppression of neuroinflammation, including excessive activation of microglia and astrocytes and the increased level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as reported previously 12 . Although further investigation is required, our current and previous results point to the potential efficacy of maternal H 2 administration on the long-term neurological outcomes of offspring exposed to inflammation in utero.

Reagents. LPS (serotype O55:B5) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). HW and hydrogen medium (HM) were prepared by dissolving H 2 gas as described previously 12, 75 . Both HW and HM had a concentration of >0.4 mM H 2 .

Animals and treatments. The experimental protocols in this study were approved by the Animal Experiment Committee of Nagoya University (approval number: 29154), and were carried out in accordance with the Regulations on Animal Experiments in Nagoya University. Pregnant ICR (CD-1) mice (7-8 weeks) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Kanagawa, Japan). All mice were allowed free access to food and water and were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at 9:00 AM). The pregnant mice were assigned randomly to three groups of five dams each: Control group, LPS group, and HW + LPS group (Fig. 6) , as in our previous report 12 . All pregnant mice, except for those in the Control group, received an intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of 75 μg of LPS dissolved in sterile saline on E17. In the Control group, the pregnant mice were injected with an equal volume of sterile saline. In the HW + LPS group, the pregnant mice were administered HW, beginning 24 h before LPS injection and continuing until parturition. HW was aliquoted in glass drinking bottles to prevent H 2 degassing as well as air refilling. Offspring growth evaluation and behavioral testing. As shown in Fig. 6 , after birth, all offspring were housed with their mother until P19, when they were weaned, as previously reported 76, 77 . We only used male offspring in all of the experiments because of previously reported sex effects 43 . All animals were left undisturbed except for measuring body weights and weekly cage changes. Body weight was recorded at P4, 6, 8, 10, 13, 16, and 19 . The order of the behavioral tests was as follows: (1) Y-maze test at postnatal 3 weeks 78 ; and (2) three-chamber sociability and social novelty test 79 and PPI test at postnatal 4 weeks, according to previous reports (Fig. 6 ). All behavioral tests were conducted between 1 PM and 8 PM.

Y-maze test. The Y-maze test was carried out as described previously 80 . Briefly, the test was performed in a Y-shaped maze with three opaque plastic arms situated at 120° angles from each other. Each mouse was placed individually in the center of the apparatus and allowed to explore the maze freely during an 8-min session. The series of arm entries were recorded visually. Alternation was defined as successive entries into the three arms, on overlapping triplet sets. The percent alternation was calculated as the ratio of actual to possible alternations (defined as the total number of arm entries minus two) multiplied by 100. Spontaneous alternation (%) was used to quantify short-term memory.

Three-chamber social test. The three-chamber social test was performed as described previously 81 . Briefly, the apparatus consisted of a black Plexiglas rectangular box and two identical clear Plexiglas cylinders. There were three interconnected chambers in the box. The light was conditioned at 20 lux in an experimental room. During the habituation phase, empty cylinders were placed in each of the end chambers. A mouse was introduced to the center chamber and its behavioral approach to the end chambers was monitored for 10 min. During the sociability test, an unfamiliar male ICR (CD-1) mouse (stranger 1) that had no prior contact with the test mouse was placed in one of the empty chambers, and the behavioral approach of the test mouse to the empty chamber and stranger 1 was monitored for 10 min. During the social novelty test, a new unfamiliar male ICR (CD-1) mouse (stranger 2) was placed in the third chamber, and the behavioral approach of the test mouse to stranger 1 and stranger 2 was monitored for 10 min. The time spent in each zone was calculated using the Ethovision automated tracking program (Noldus, Wageningen, The Netherlands).

Prepulse inhibition test. The PPI test was carried out as described previously 80 with the SR-LAB system (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, California). Briefly, after habituation for 10 min, the animals received 10 startle trials, 10 no-stimulus trials, and 40 PPI trials. Each startle trial consisted of a single 120 dB white noise burst lasting 40 msec. The PPI trials consisted of a prepulse (20 msec burst of white noise at 69, 73, 77, or 81 dB intensity) followed, 100 msec later, by the startle stimulus (120 dB, 40 msec white noise). The total session lasted 17 min. The resulting movement of the animal in the startle chamber was measured for 100 msec after the startle stimulus onset (sampling frequency 1 kHz), rectified, amplified, and input into a computer, which calculated the maximal response over the 100-msec period. The basal startle amplitude was determined as the mean amplitude of the 10 startle trials. The PPI was calculated according to the following formula: 100 × [1 − (PP×/P120)] %, in which PPx was the mean of the 10 PPI trials (PP69, PP73, PP75, or PP81) and P120 was the basal startle amplitude.

After the behavioral analysis, 12 offspring in each group were selected randomly and sacrificed by decapitation at postnatal 5 weeks (Fig. 6) . The offspring were perfused via the heart with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. The brains were then fixed in 4% PFA for at least 24 h, embedded in paraffin, and cut in coronal planes (approximately 2.0 mm posterior to bregma). Immunofluorescence staining was performed using the following primary antibodies: rabbit monoclonal anti-Olig2 antibody (ab109186, 1:100; Abcam, Tokyo, Japan) or rabbit polyclonal anti-GFAP antibody (23935-1-AP, 1:100; Proteintech, Chicago, IL). The sections were incubated with the primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight and were further incubated with secondary antibodies (Alexa fluor 488, 1:500 or Alexa fluor 563, 1:500; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 30 min at room temperature. Nissl staining was also performed in order to evaluate the number of neuronal cells. Following deparaffinization, the tissue sections were incubated in 0.2% cresyl violet (Muto Pure Chemicals Co.), and subsequently dehydrated in graded ethanol, and permanently mounted. Images were acquired with a BZ-9000 microscope (Keyence Corporation, Osaka, Japan). The BZ Image Measurement Software program (Keyence) was used to quantify the number of neuronal cells and Olig2-positive cells, as well as the number and the soma size of the GFAP-positive cells.

Astrocytic cultures. Mouse primary astrocytes were isolated from primary mixed glial-cell cultures of newborn ICR mice, as described previously 82, 83 . The purity of the astrocytes was >95%, as determined by immunostaining with the anti-GFAP antibody. Astrocytes were plated at a density of 3 × 10 5 cells/well in 6-well dishes. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 mg/ml bovine insulin, and 0.2% glucose. To assess the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, confluent astrocytes were treated with 1 μg/ml LPS and/or HM. H 2 treatment was performed by replacing the astroglial medium with HM, and dehydrogenated HM was used as a control medium. The time course of H 2 concentration in HM was described previously 12 . Replacement of the astroglial medium with HM or control medium was performed 3 h before the addition of LPS.

Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Total RNA from the astrocyte cultures was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The RT reaction with 100 ng of total RNA was carried out with a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (ReverTra Ace; Toyobo Co., Ltd, Osaka, Japan). The expression levels of mRNAs encoding TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were evaluated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using the Thermal Cycler Dice (Takara Bio Inc., Tokyo, Japan) and SYBRII Premix Ex Taq (Takara Bio Inc.) reagents. Primers for qRT-PCR are listed in Table 1 .

Statistical analysis. The data are presented as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM). To analyze the neonatal body weights, two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used, followed by a Bonferroni post-hoc test. The mRNA expression levels in astrocyte cultures were also analyzed by two-way ANOVA, followed by a Bonferroni post-hoc test. All other data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test. The statistical analyses were performed using Prism 5 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).

Lactate Dehydrogenase-Elevating Virus Induces Systemic Lymphocyte Activation via TLR7-Dependent IFNa Responses by Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells

Background: Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) is a natural infectious agent of mice. Like several other viruses, LDV causes widespread and very rapid but transient activation of both B cells and T cells in lymphoid tissues and the blood. The mechanism of this activation has not been fully described and is the focus of the current studies.

Principal Findings: A known inducer of early lymphocyte activation is IFNa, a cytokine strongly induced by LDV infection. Neutralization of IFNa in the plasma from infected mice ablated its ability to activate lymphocytes in vitro. Since the primary source of virus-induced IFNa in vivo is often plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC's), we depleted these cells prior to LDV infection and tested for lymphocyte activation. Depletion of pDC's in vivo eradicated both the LDV-induced IFNa response and lymphocyte activation. A primary receptor in pDC's for single stranded RNA viruses such as LDV is the toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) pattern recognition receptor. Infection of TLR7-knockout mice revealed that both the IFNa response and lymphocyte activation were dependent on TLR7 signaling in vivo. Interestingly, virus levels in both TLR7 knockout mice and pDC-depleted mice were indistinguishable from controls indicating that LDV is largely resistant to the systemic IFNa response.

Conclusion: Results indicate that LDV-induced activation of lymphocytes is due to recognition of LDV nucleic acid by TLR7 pattern recognition receptors in pDC's that respond with a lymphocyte-inducing IFNa response.

Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) is a small, positive sense, single stranded RNA virus of the Arteriviridae family, related to coronaviruses such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus [1, 2, 3, 4] . It is a natural infectious agent of mice that causes very rapid lytic infections generally restricted to a minor subset of non-essential macrophages involved in scavenging extracellular lactate dehydrogenase [5, 6] . The rapid loss of this subset results in the elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels for which the virus is named [7] . Virus titers peak within the first day of infection as susceptible target cells are depleted, and then the infection is maintained at a much lower chronic level dependent on the replenishment of new macrophage targets [8] . LDV establishes chronic infections regardless of mouse strain, age, sex or immune-status [5, 8, 9, 10] . No clinical signs are typically associated with LDV infections, although co-infection with retroviruses can lead to CNS disease under certain circumstances [11, 12] , and mice infected with LDV have suppressed immune responses [13, 14, 15, 16] . We recently found that acute infection with LDV induced a state of partial and transient activation in the vast majority of splenic lymphocytes. Activation was characterized by high surface expression of the very early activation marker CD69 [16] . CD69 is the first surface marker known to be upregulated during the activation of lymphocytes and has recently been shown to interact with S1P1 to inhibit the egress of lymphocytes from lymphoid tissues [17] . CD69 expression is upregulated by T cell receptor (TCR) ligation [18] but is not dependent upon it and can be induced by inflammatory cytokines such as IFNa [19, 20] .

To investigate the mechanism of lymphocyte activation following LDV infection we first analyzed the kinetics of CD69 upregulation on splenic lymphocytes at several time points following infection. CD69 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry as previously described [16] and became detectable at 14 hours post-infection, peaked at 16 to 24 hours, and returned almost to background levels by 72 hours ( Figure 1A ). The induction of CD69 occurred on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as B cells ( Figure 1B ). In addition to the spleen, CD69 upregulation was also observed, albeit to a lesser extent, on lymphocytes from the blood, lymph nodes, and bone marrow ( Figure 1C ). In contrast, no significant upregulation was observed on lymphocytes from the thymus, which are primarily immature T cells. In contrast to CD69, the IL-2 receptor alpha chain (CD25), which is upregulated later in the activation cascade and is typically dependent on TCR ligation [21] , did not increase in expression during the first day of LDV infection (data not shown). This result is consistent with partial rather than full activation of the lymphocytes.

The rapid systemic appearance of CD69 expression suggested that a soluble factor such as IFNa, a known early responder to viral infections [22] and strong trigger of CD69 expression [17, 19, 20] , was inducing the response. To determine whether the LDV-induced IFNa response [16] could be responsible for CD69 induction, we first utilized the fact that IFNa induces CD69 expression on B cells in vitro [19] . Splenic B cells were isolated from naïve mice using CD19+ magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec) and cultured with 10% plasma taken from mice infected 16 hours earlier with LDV. B cells cultured for 4 hours with plasma from infected, but not uninfected mice, significantly upregulated CD69 expression ( Figure 2 ). Furthermore, upregulation of CD69 expression was prevented by addition of a neutralizing antibody specific for IFNa (PBL Interferon Source) in a concentrationdependent manner. These findings suggested that the IFNa response to LDV infection might be responsible for the partial activation of lymphocytes in vivo as well.

Although any cell can produce IFNa in response to infection, the acute systemic response to viruses has been attributed to production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC's, also known as interferon-producing cells or IPC) [23, 24, 25] , which comprise only a minor subpopulation of cells but can produce 1000 times as much IFNa as other cells [24] . Conventional DC's can also produce high amounts of IFNa if they are directly infected, but pDC's are uniquely able to secrete high levels of IFNa in response to endocytosed antigen. The role of pDC's in production of IFNa during LDV infection was investigated by depleting mice of pDC's the day before LDV infection using a pDC-specific depleting antibody [26] . The plasma IFNa response at 16 hours postinfection with LDV, as measured by ELISA, was abolished by pDC depletion ( Figure 3A ). Thus the systemic IFNa response was predominantly due to production by pDC's. In addition to loss of the IFNa response in pDC-depleted mice, we also observed the failure of splenic lymphocytes to upregulate CD69. A histogram showing CD69 expression on splenocytes from a representative mouse is shown in Figure 3B . Combined with the dependence on IFNafor upregulation of CD69 on B cells in vitro, the data indicate (B) Upregulation of CD69 on major splenic lymphocyte subsets at 16hpi with LDV was analyzed by co-staining with antibodies for CD69 and either CD4, CD8 or CD19 as indicated. The difference in percentage of CD69 hi cells between naïve and infected mice was statistically significant for all subsets by t test, P = 0.0225 for CD4 + T cells, 0.003 for CD8 + T cells, and 0.0018 for CD19 + B cells (n = 2 mice per naïve group and 3 mice per infected group.) (C) Tissue distribution of CD69 upregulation. Lymphocytes from spleen, blood, lymph nodes, bone marrow, and thymus were examined at 16hpi with LDV. All tissues except the thymus showed a significantly higher percentage of CD69 hi lymphocytes when infected with LDV infected (P,0.01 for all groups indicated by *). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0006105.g001 that in vivo upregulation of CD69 on lymphocytes is likely due to the systemic IFNa response to LDV infection. Interestingly, the loss of the IFNa response in pDC-depleted mice produced no statistically significant difference in LDV plasma levels as measured by real time PCR (15) ( Figure 3C ). Since IFNa can act in both autocrine and paracrine manners to limit virus replication and spread [27] , it appears that LDV is quite resistant to the antiviral effects of IFNa, even when present at very high systemic levels.

Given that LDV is a single-stranded RNA virus, we investigated whether the pDC-dependent IFNa response was mediated by toll like receptor 7 (TLR7), which is highly expressed by pDC's, binds to single stranded viral RNA, and is capable of initiating IFNa responses in pDC's without their direct infection [28] . Mice containing a genetically inactivated TLR7 gene [29, 30] failed to mount IFNa responses or to upregulate CD69 expression in response to LDV infection, whereas genetically matched TLR7 wild type mice showed strong IFNa responses and CD69 upregulation ( Figure 4A, B) . Consistent with the results from pDC depletions, LDV plasma titers were again not significantly different in the absence of TLR7 expression and IFNa production ( Figure 4C ). These results are similar to data from type I interferon receptor-deficient mice infected with LDV, although that study noted slight (two fold) increases in virus titers in the absence of type I interferon signaling [31] .

Together, our data indicate that pDC's activated in a TLR7dependent manner are primarily responsible for the rapid systemic IFNa response following infection of mice with LDV. Furthermore, the interferon response was most likely responsible for the transient expression of the CD69 very early activation marker on lymphocytes during acute LDV infection. IFNa-dependent, partial activation of lymphocytes has also been reported during acute infection with Semliki forest virus [20] , human adenovirus 2, West Nile virus, and A/WSN influenza virus [32] in mice. However, not all acute viral infections induce partial activation, as it does not occur in Friend retrovirus infections of mice [16] . Such broad activation is by definition non-specific, and leaves open the question of how it benefits the host. Alsharifi et al. have proposed that IFNa-induced partial activation may promote adaptive immune responses by lowering the threshold for full activation once antigen-specific recognition occurs [33] . If so, IFNa may be a very important regulatory link between the innate and adaptive immune responses. Based on the findings that CD69 acts downstream of IFNa to inhibit lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs [17] , it is also likely that CD69 expression facilitates sustained contacts between lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells during inflammatory responses, thereby enhancing full activation of antigen-specific lymphocytes. 0049 by t test) . A representative histogram of CD69 expression on cells from LDVinfected mice that were pDC-depleted pDC 2 ) or mock-treated (pDC + ) is shown. The histograms of cells from naïve animals overlapped with the curves from pDC depleted mice (data not shown). (C) pDC depletion did not significantly alter LDV levels in plasma as indicated by results from semiquantitative real-time RT-PCR as previously described [16] . Relative LDV levels are indicated by real time PCR critical threshold (Ct) values, which were not significantly different between LDV-infected normal mice (pDC + ) Ct = 22.05+/20.33, and LDV-infected, pDC-depleted mice (pDC 2 ) Ct = 21.72+/20.43 (n = 5). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0006105.g003 TLR7 wild type and knockout mice on the 129SvEv genetic background were infected with LDV and blood was analyzed at 16hpi.

Coxsackievirus B3 Responds to Polyamine Depletion via Enhancement of 2A and 3C Protease Activity

Polyamines are small positively-charged molecules abundant in eukaryotic cells that are crucial to RNA virus replication. In eukaryotic cells, polyamines facilitate processes such as transcription, translation, and DNA replication, and viruses similarly rely on polyamines to facilitate transcription and translation. Whether polyamines function at additional stages in viral replication remains poorly understood. Picornaviruses, including Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), are sensitive to polyamine depletion both in vitro and in vivo; however, precisely how polyamine function in picornavirus infection has not been described. Here, we describe CVB3 mutants that arise with passage in polyamine-depleted conditions. We observe mutations in the 2A and 3C proteases, and we find that these mutant proteases confer resistance to polyamine depletion. Using a split luciferase reporter system to measure protease activity, we determined that polyamines facilitate viral protease activity. We further observe that the 2A and 3C protease mutations enhance reporter protease activity in polyamine-depleted conditions. Finally, we find that these mutations promote cleavage of cellular eIF4G during infection of polyamine-depleted cells. In sum, our results suggest that polyamines are crucial to protease function during picornavirus infection. Further, these data highlight viral proteases as potential antiviral targets and highlight how CVB3 may overcome polyamine-depleting antiviral therapies. Viral proteases play many roles during infection, and picornaviruses encode two distinct proteases: 2A (2A pro ) and 3C (3C pro ). The 2A and 3C picornaviral proteases function to cleave both host and viral proteins. 3C is responsible for the majority of viral polyprotein cleavage. Importantly, 3C also functions as part of 3CD (a polyprotein consisting of the 3C protease and 3D polymerase) and acts as a protease in this context as well [11] . To date, reports demonstrated that 2A facilitates the cleavage between the P1 and P2 protein segments [12] . The precise regulation of these proteases, their activities, and their overlapping and unique functions remains to be fully understood. However, due to their copious functions during infection, they represent potential drug targets [13] [14] [15] .

Polyamines are small, positively-charged molecules that are abundant in eukaryotic cells. Polyamines function in nucleotide metabolism, cell cycling, and cell signaling, among several other functions [16] [17] [18] . Several compounds have been developed that specifically target polyamine metabolism, either by reducing their synthesis or enhancing their breakdown, and these compounds have been tested clinically for the treatment of cancers and parasites [19] [20] [21] . Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), which inhibits polyamine biosynthesis, has received attention as an anti-trypanosomal molecule and is well-tolerated in patients [22, 23] . Polyamines are also crucial for RNA virus infection, including CVB3 [24]. Polyamine depletion via DFMO restricts CVB3 infection, in vitro and in vivo [25]. We previously described how Chikungunya and Zika viruses rely on polyamines for viral translation and genome replication [26] ; however, whether similar processes are affected for other viruses and precisely how polyamines function during CVB3 replication remain to be completely understood.

To investigate how polyamines facilitate CVB3 infection, we performed a screen for virus escape mutants that were resistant to DFMO treatment. We isolated two distinct viral mutants in the 2A and 3C proteases. We determined that these mutant viruses were resistant to polyamine depletion and that these mutations conferred no fitness advantage in the absence of polyamine depletion. To investigate the proteolytic activity of these enzymes, we developed a protease-dependent split-luciferase reporter system to measure 2A and 3C activity. Using this assay, we observed that 2A and 3C activity was diminished with polyamine depletion, to which mutant 2A and 3C proteases were resistant. Additionally, we observed that viruses containing these mutants were able to cleave cellular targets efficiently in polyamine-depleted cells. Together, these data suggest that polyamines are crucial for viral protease activity and that we may target CVB3 proteolytic activity through polyamine-depleting pharmaceuticals like DFMO.

Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is a positive-sense RNA virus, belonging to the Picornaviridae family. CVB3 commonly infects children, resulting in a self-limiting illness that can lead to the development of muscle, lung, and heart maladies. Importantly, CVB3 infection can lead to myocarditis and endocarditis, and the virus is able to persist in cardiac tissue [1, 2] . Currently, no antivirals are available for treating or preventing CVB3 infection; thus, the identification of novel antiviral targets is crucial to controlling infection. Viral proteases, including enteroviral proteases, play crucial roles in the replication of RNA viruses [3] . Following virus entry, picornavirus RNA is directly translated via host ribosomes into a polyprotein, containing both structural and nonstructural proteins. This large protein is subsequently cleaved to generate functionally distinct viral proteins. Importantly, the ability of viral proteases to cleave the viral polyprotein is essential for productive infection, as limiting viral protease activity significantly hinders virus infection. Modulation of protease activity, however, can also alter antiviral susceptibility [4] . Additionally, viral proteins cleave several host proteins, including translation factors, immune effectors, and signaling molecules [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] , to establish a proviral environment. 

CVB3 (Nancy strain) was derived from the first passage of virus in Vero cells (NR-10385), which were obtained through BEI Resources, National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (NR-10385). For all infections, DFMO and diethylnorsmperidine (DENSpm) were maintained throughout infection as designated. Viral stocks were maintained at −80 • C. For infection, the virus was diluted in serum-free DMEM for a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 on Vero cells, unless otherwise indicated. The viral inoculum was overlain on cells for 10 to 30 min, and the cells were washed with PBS before replenishment of media. Supernatants were collected from CVB3 24 hpi and 48 hpi. Dilutions of cell supernatant were prepared in serum-free DMEM and used to inoculate confluent monolayer of Vero cells for 10 to 15 min at 37 • C. Cells were overlaid with 0.8% agarose in DMEM containing 2% NBCS. CVB3 samples incubated for 2 days at 37 • C. Following appropriate incubation, cells were fixed with 4% formalin and revealed with crystal violet solution (10% crystal violet; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Plaques were enumerated and used to back-calculate the number of plaque forming units (pfu) per milliliter of collected volume.

Vero cells were treated with DFMO for four days prior to infection with CVB3 at MOI 0.1. After 24 h, 1/10th of the cell culture volume was used to inoculate the next virus passage. This process was continued for ten passages, at which time RNA was purified from the cellular supernatant, reverse transcribed, amplified using CVB3-specific primers, and Sanger sequenced. Sequences were aligned to CVB3 parental genome and mutants were confirmed by manual chromatogram verification.

Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO; TargetMol, Boston, MA, USA) and N1,N11-Diethylnorspermine (DENSpm; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) were diluted to 100× solution (100 mM and 10 mM, respectively) in sterile water. For DFMO treatments, cells were trypsinized and reseeded with fresh medium supplemented with 2% serum. Following overnight attachment, cells were treated with 100 µM, 500 µM, 1 mM, or 2 mM DFMO. Cells were incubated with DFMO for 96 h to allow for depletion of polyamines in Vero cells. For DENSpm treatment, cells were treated with 100 nM, 1 µM, 10 µM, 100 µM, and 1 mM 16 h prior to infection. During infection, media was cleared and saved from the cells. The same medium containing DFMO and DENSpm was then used to replenish the cells following infection. Cells were incubated at the appropriate temperature for the duration of the infection.

Media was cleared from cells and Trizol reagent (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) directly added. The lysate was then collected, and RNA was purified according to the manufacturer's protocol utilizing the Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Plus Kit (Zymo Research). Purified RNA was subsequently used for cDNA synthesis using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits (Thermo-Fischer), according to the manufacturer's protocol, with 10-100 ng of RNA and random hexamer primers.

Vero cells were treated with either 100 µM to 2000 µM DFMO for 4 days or 1 µm to 100 µM DENSpm for 16 h prior to infection with CVB3 at an MOI of 0.1. At 24 hpi, supernatants were collected and titers were determined.

To measure the stability of the mutations, Vero cells were infected at an MOI of 0.1 with all of the viral mutants for 24 h. The virus was then passed to new cells by transferring 50 µL supernatant. After five passages, RNA was extracted and purified from supernatants and reverse transcribed. Sanger sequencing was used to determine whether mutations were stable over the passages by looking at the chromatograms and determining the presence or absence of the mutant nucleotide. Fitness assays were similarly performed, but Vero cells were infected at an MOI of 0.1 with an equal combination of wild-type and mutant CVB3 and passaged five times. Fitness was determined via Sanger sequencing and analysis of the chromatogram to determine if the wild-type or mutant nucleotide was present in the sample.

Primers were designed to target either the wild-type 2A or 3C protease. CVB3 plasmids containing either the 2A mutant protease or 3C mutant protease were used to clone the mutant proteases. To target the 2A and 2A mutant proteases, the primers included SacI and XbaI recognition sites (Table 1) . Primers against the 3C and 3C mutant proteases included NotI and XbaI recognition sites. Protease sequences were amplified via PCR and cloned into the pFLAG-CMV-LAP1 vector. Clones were verified for sequencing (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Oligonucleotide sequences corresponding to the amino acid sequence for the wild-type and mutant 2A and 3C protease targets were designed and cloned into the pGlo-3F vector and verified by sequencing (GenScript).

293T cells were plated at 80%-90% confluency and either treated with 100 µM, 500 µM, 1000 µM or 2000 µM DFMO for 4-days or left untreated. The plasmids were then transfected in the combinations described in the figures, according to the manufacturer's protocol, using LipoD293 (SignaGen Laboratories, Rockville, MD, USA). The transfection was incubated at 37 • C for 24 h. 

Samples were collected with Bolt LDS Buffer and Bolt Reducing Agent (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) and run on polyacrylamide gels. Gels were transferred using the iBlot 2 Gel Transfer Device (Invitrogen). Membranes were probed with primary antibodies for eIF4G, (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), GAPDH (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and β-actin (1:5000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Membranes were treated with SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate (ThermoFisher Scientific) and visualized on FluorChem E imager (Protein Simple, San Jose, CA, USA).

To quantify the relative plaque sizes of the different CVB3 mutants, Vero cells were seeded in 10 cm dishes and grown to confluence. Approximately 30 plaque-forming units (PFU) of each mutant was diluted in a 2.5 mL inoculum of serum-free DMEM. The media on the Vero cells was aspirated and replaced with the 2.5 mL inoculum containing the virus. The inoculum was incubated on the cells for approximately 30 min at 37 • C. After 30 min, an overlay of 8 mL 0.8% agarose was added to each dish. The dishes were incubated at 37 • C for 2 days to allow plaque formation. The cells were fixed with 4% formalin and the agarose plugs removed. The fixed cells were stained with crystal violet. Plaque size was determined using ImageJ software (Version 1.51k) [29] .

Polyamines were separated by thin-layer chromatography as previously described [30] . For all samples, cells were treated as described prior to being trypsinized and centrifuged. Pellets were washed with PBS and then resuspended in 200 µL 2% perchloric acid. Samples were then incubated overnight at 4 • C. 200 µL of supernatant was combined with 200 µL 5 mg/mL dansyl chloride (Sigma Aldrich) in acetone and 100 µL saturated sodium bicarbonate. Samples were incubated in the dark overnight at room temperature. Excess dansyl chloride was cleared by incubating the reaction with 100 µL 150 mg/mL proline (Sigma Aldrich). Dansylated polyamines were extracted with 50 µL toluene (Sigma Aldrich) and centrifuged. Five microliter of sample was added in small spots to the TLC plate (silica gel matrix; Sigma Aldrich) and exposed to ascending chromatography with 1:1 cyclohexane: ethyl acetate. The plate was dried and visualized via exposure to UV.

Prism 6 (GraphPad) was used to generate graphs and perform statistical analysis. For all analyses, two-tailed Student's t-test was used to compare groups, unless otherwise noted, with a = 0.05. For tests of sample proportions, p values were derived from calculated Z scores with two tails and a = 0.05. Half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were calculated using Prism 6 using the built-in analysis tool.

Our previous work demonstrating that CVB3 was sensitive to polyamine depletion via DFMO suggested a role for polyamines in virus replication [25] . To ascertain how CVB3 evolves in response to repeated replication cycles in the absence of polyamine depletion, we passaged the virus in the presence of DFMO. We treated Vero-E6 cells with 500 µM DFMO or left controls untreated (NT), for four days prior to infection with CVB3 at MOI 0.1 plaque forming units (pfu)/mL. After 24 h, we collected cellular supernatant and passaged 1/10th of the volume onto naïve cells. Viral titers were determined intermittently ( Figure 1A ) and at passage five, the passaged virus was exposed to increasing doses of DFMO, from 10 µM to 5 mM, and titers measured by plaque assay after 24 h of infection. We observed that virus that had been passaged but not exposed to DFMO remained susceptible, with significant decreases in viral titer observed at DFMO concentrations above 100 µM and an IC50 value of 70.9 µM. In contrast, virus passaged in DFMO exhibited significant resistance to DFMO treatment, with an IC50 value of 293 µM, suggesting developing resistance to DFMO.

Viruses 2019, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 15 determined intermittently ( Figure 1A ) and at passage five, the passaged virus was exposed to increasing doses of DFMO, from 10 µM to 5 mM, and titers measured by plaque assay after 24 h of infection. We observed that virus that had been passaged but not exposed to DFMO remained susceptible, with significant decreases in viral titer observed at DFMO concentrations above 100 µM and an IC50 value of 70.9 µM. In contrast, virus passaged in DFMO exhibited significant resistance to DFMO treatment, with an IC50 value of 293 µM, suggesting developing resistance to DFMO. Following passage of virus, RNA was extracted, purified, reverse transcribed and Sanger sequenced. When the sequenced virus was aligned with the parental CVB3 genome, mutations in the two viral proteases, 2A (Q29K) and 3C (Q52R), were observed. Interestingly, these mutations were observed independently in three distinct viral lineages. Further, the 2A 29K and 3C 52R mutations were not observed in the same lineage. Importantly, no mutations were observed in viruses passaged without treatment.

Observing the development of resistance to DFMO and the emergence of mutants in the passaged virus, we cloned these mutations in the CVB3 parental strain using mutagenic PCR on the CVB3 infectious clone. In addition to 2A 29K and 3C 52R mutants, we generated a 2A 29K /3C 52R double mutant. After confirming the presence of the mutations, we generated an infectious virus and measured the virus titer over several rounds of replication. Vero cells were treated with 500 µM DFMO or left untreated for four days prior to infection at MOI 0.01. Cellular supernatant samples were collected and titered via plaque assay. As shown in Figure 2A , all viruses in untreated conditions replicated with similar kinetics and to similar levels regardless of protease mutation. However, in DFMO-treated cells, the wildtype CVB3 exhibited significant reductions in titer, which persisted to 72 hpi. Interestingly, the protease mutants, either alone or in combination, exhibited a Following passage of virus, RNA was extracted, purified, reverse transcribed and Sanger sequenced.

Vero cells were treated with 500 µM DFMO or left untreated for four days prior to infection at MOI 0.01. Cellular supernatant samples were collected and titered via plaque assay. As shown in Figure 2A , all viruses in untreated conditions replicated with similar kinetics and to similar levels regardless of protease mutation. However, in DFMO-treated cells, the wildtype CVB3 exhibited significant reductions in titer, which persisted to 72 hpi. Interestingly, the protease mutants, either alone or in combination, exhibited a significant rescue in viral titer compared to the wildtype virus, suggesting partial resistance to polyamine depletion.

To quantify resistance, we measured viral titers of wildtype and protease-mutant virus in untreated and DFMO-treated Vero cells over a concentration range ( Figure 2B ). We infected these cells at MOI 0.1 and measured viral titers at 48 hpi. We again observed significant sensitivity by the wildtype virus with any concentration of DFMO; in contrast, both protease mutants exhibited significant resistance, again suggesting that these mutations confer resistance to polyamine depletion. We then measured percent replication by dividing the titer in DFMO treatment conditions (500 µM) by the titer in untreated conditions from 48 hpi ( Figure 2C ). We observed that compared to wildtype virus, all mutants exhibited higher replication, and the protease mutations conferred similar levels of resistance. Combination of the mutations appeared to additively enhance replication; however, this difference was not statistically significant.

by the titer in untreated conditions from 48 hpi ( Figure 2C ). We observed that compared to wildtype virus, all mutants exhibited higher replication, and the protease mutations conferred similar levels of resistance. Combination of the mutations appeared to additively enhance replication; however, this difference was not statistically significant.

While these mutations were obtained from a serial passage in DFMO-treated cells, we wished to determine whether these mutations conferred resistance to polyamine depletion and were not a consequence of a pleiotropic effect from DFMO. Toward this end, we treated cells with a different polyamine-depleting agent, diethylnorspermidine (DENSpm), which acts to accelerate polyamine catabolism by acetylating spermidine and spermine. Vero cells were treated with 100 µM DENSpm for 16 h prior to infection at MOI 0.1 with wildtype and mutant CVB3. At 48 hpi, we measured viral titers, and again we observed significant sensitivity with the wildtype virus ( Figure 2D ). However, we observed partial resistance in our protease mutant viruses. As with DFMO, when we calculated the percent replication in DENSpm-treated cells compared to untreated cells, the protease mutants exhibited resistance that was additive ( Figure 2E ). We verified that both of these molecules were depleting polyamines in our treated cells by directly visualizing polyamines via thin-layer chromatography ( Figure 2F ). While these mutations were obtained from a serial passage in DFMO-treated cells, we wished to determine whether these mutations conferred resistance to polyamine depletion and were not a consequence of a pleiotropic effect from DFMO. Toward this end, we treated cells with a different polyamine-depleting agent, diethylnorspermidine (DENSpm), which acts to accelerate polyamine catabolism by acetylating spermidine and spermine. Vero cells were treated with 100 µM DENSpm for 16 h prior to infection at MOI 0.1 with wildtype and mutant CVB3. At 48 hpi, we measured viral titers, and again we observed significant sensitivity with the wildtype virus ( Figure 2D ). However, we observed partial resistance in our protease mutant viruses. As with DFMO, when we calculated the percent replication in DENSpm-treated cells compared to untreated cells, the protease mutants exhibited resistance that was additive ( Figure 2E ). We verified that both of these molecules were depleting polyamines in our treated cells by directly visualizing polyamines via thin-layer chromatography ( Figure 2F ).

To determine whether our protease-mutant viruses differed significantly from our wildtype virus, we characterized fitness and replication characteristics. As shown in Figure 2A , the wildtype and mutant viruses replicate with similar kinetics. To ascertain whether these viruses produced similar levels of infectious particles, we measured the ratio of viral genomes to infectious virus. Vero cells were infected with the wildtype or protease mutant viruses for 48 h, and subsequently, viral titers ( Figure 3A ) were determined by plaque assay and RNA was processed from infected cellular supernatant. The number of viral genomes was quantified by qRT-PCR ( Figure 3B) , and the ratio of genomes to infectious virus (pfu) calculated ( Figure 3C ). We observed no changes in viral titers in polyamine-sufficient conditions, and viral genomes were slightly elevated, though not statistically significant, in 2A 29K and 3C 52R mutant viruses ( Figure 3B) . Overall, the genome-to-pfu ratio was not statistically significantly different among our protease mutant viruses.

Passaging CVB3 in Vero cells can result in the emergence of a virus with fitness changes that provide a replicative advantage, as we had observed with our CHIKV mutant viruses [31] . To determine whether our CVB3 mutants had fitness enhancement manifesting as a more rapidly replicating virus, we measured virus plaque sizes of wildtype and protease mutant virus. We observed no significant difference between wildtype and mutant CVB3 plaque size ( Figure 3D ). To better measure viral fitness via competition assay, we infected Vero cells with equal quantities of infectious virus of wildtype and 2A 29K or 3C 52R , and after five passages, we extracted RNA, reverse transcribed, amplified viral genomes by PCR, and Sanger sequenced the appropriate genomic locus corresponding to each protease (Table 1) . After the fifth passage, we observed that the wildtype and either protease mutant virus existed as a mixed population, with peaks corresponding to the wildtype and mutant nucleotide present in the samples ( Figure 3E , representative of three independent passages). Additionally, we passaged mutant virus without competition to determine the stability of the mutant. We observed that the mutation was maintained after five passages, suggesting that there is no fitness cost to this mutation in our cell culture conditions. Altogether, our data suggest that protease-mutant CVB3 exhibits no significant replicative advantage compared to wildtype CVB3. 

Given that we had observed resistance mutations in both 2A and 3C proteases after passaging virus in polyamine-depleted cells, we hypothesized that viral protease activity may be modulated by cellular polyamines. While previous reports have suggested that polyamines enhance chymotrypsin activity [32, 33] , a role for polyamines in viral protease activity has never been reported. Toward this end, we treated cells with increasing doses of DFMO or DENSpm to deplete cellular polyamines. Following incubation with a drug, cells were infected at MOI 10 for 24 h, at which time cellular lysates were collected for western analysis. Lysates were analyzed for the presence of cleaved eIF4G, a cellular target of the viral proteases. We observed that in infected cells, a distinct eIF4G band was present; however, in cells treated either with DFMO or DENSpm, eIF4G cleavage was significantly restricted ( Figure 4A ). We were unable to visualize full-length eIF4G, likely due to its large size.

The reduction in eIF4G cleavage by viral protease in the presence of polyamine depleting molecules could be the result of polyamines modulating viral protease activity, or the phenotype could be due to restriction of virus replication, protease translation, and subsequent reduction in proteolytic activity. To directly measure viral protease activity in cells, we generated a proteasesensitive dual luciferase reporter system. In this split luciferase system, cleavage of a target sequence allows for robust firefly luciferase activity, which can be normalized to a renilla luciferase transfection control. This system has previously been used to explore the activity of viral polymerases [34] [35] [36] , though it has not been considered in the context of polyamine depletion.

To generate this system, we cloned a 2A target sequence-MTNTGAFG-and a 3C target sequence-AMEQG-into the firefly luciferase reporter [37] . We also cloned 2A and 3C into the pCMV plasmid to drive robust protease expression. These constructs were cotransfected into 293T cells either left untreated or treated with increasing doses of DFMO. Firefly activity was measured 24 h later and normalized to renilla activity. We observed that for both 2A ( Figure 4C ) and 3C ( Figure 4D ), protease activity was significantly reduced with DFMO treatment, to levels that were nearly undetectable with DFMO concentrations at or above 500 µM. These data support our hypothesis that polyamines modulate viral protease activity, and polyamine depletion restricts virus replication by quelling viral protease activity.

With resistance mutations emerging in CVB3 2A and 3C proteases, we next hypothesized that these mutations may enhance viral replication in polyamine-depleted cells by maintaining proteolytic activity. To test this, we generated mutant 2A 29K and 3C 52R proteases through site-directed mutagenesis of our overexpression vectors. We then cotransfected these proteases and the wildtype controls with our luciferase reporter system into untreated and 500 µM DFMO-treated Veros. At 24 h, we measured luciferase activity and normalized to renilla luciferase activity and to control cells transfected with luciferase reporter alone (no protease). We observed that both 2A WT and 3C WT exhibited protease activity that was DFMO-sensitive ( Figure 5A,B) . Interestingly, we also observed that both 2A 29K and 3C 52R exhibited robust protease activity, even in DFMO-treated cells. We also observed that 3C 52R exhibited higher protease activity than 3C WT , though this was not observed for 2A.

We further hypothesized that mutant proteases may enhance proteolytic cleavage of a cellular target during viral infection to enhance virus replication. To this end, we treated Veros with 500 µM DFMO or left cells untreated and then infected at MOI 10 for 24 h. Cellular lysates were collected and analyzed for cleavage of eIF4G ( Figure 4C ). In untreated cells, we observed significant cleavage of eIF4G with wildtype infection that was not enhanced with infection of CVB3-2A 29K , -3C 52R , or double protease mutant. However, with DFMO treatment, eIF4G cleavage was significantly reduced in wildtype CVB3 infection, as previously observed ( Figure 4A ). When we analyzed DFMO-treated cells that were infected with protease mutant CVB3, we observed proteolytic cleavage of eIF4G, significantly higher than wildtype CVB3. In total, our data suggest that polyamine depletion significantly reduces CVB3 protease activity and that the mutant proteases derived from our passages exhibit a rescue in this sensitivity. controls with our luciferase reporter system into untreated and 500 µM DFMO-treated Veros.

Polyamines play several roles in the eukaryotic cell and likely affect virus replication at several stages. By isolating DFMO escape mutants, we can glean insight into the mechanisms by which polyamines function in virus infection. Here, we have isolated two protease mutants following passage of CVB3 in DFMO. We previously characterized escape mutants for chikungunya virus and found three mutations that conferred resistance when simultaneously present in the virus [31] . In contrast, we find that CVB3 gains resistance to DFMO with a single mutation in either protease. From our data, we cannot determine whether polyamines facilitate protease activity against a specific target; however, we observe that both viral proteases maintain activity in polyamine-depleted cells with either of these mutations and that these mutations facilitate virus infection in an otherwise antiviral environment. Determining the specificity of this activity is an area of important future investigation.

In the course of passaging CVB3 in the presence of DFMO, we observed two mutations changing from glutamine to positively charged lysine or arginine. Interestingly, we have observed such amino acid changes in our CHIKV passages [31] , in which we observed a glycine-to-arginine mutation in nsP1. Given that polyamines are positively-charged at physiological pH, the emergence of positively-charged amino acids in polyamine-depleted conditions suggests potential amino acid compensation for a loss of charge. The amino acids in which we observe mutations for CVB3 2A and 3C are not located in the active sites of either enzyme [27, 38] , suggesting that these amino acids and their associated charge may alter enzymatic activity allosterically. Precisely how positively-charged amino acids or polyamines contribute to protease activity remains unknown.

Others have observed that polyamines contribute to protease activity [39, 40] . Prior research in oat leaves identified polyamines as factors that reduce cellular protease activity and, as a result, leaf senescence [41] . The function of polyamines in plant tissues appears distinct from the functions in mammalian eukaryotic cells, though. For instance, spermidine interacts with and activates the activity of mammalian chymotrypsin [32, 33] . Whether polyamines function broadly in the function of proteases, especially viral proteases, has not been fully explored; however, our work suggests that viral proteases may be modulated by polyamines.

Targeting polyamines as an antiviral strategy shows significant promise, and the availability of FDA-approved molecules like DFMO underscores the potential of inhibiting this pathway for limiting viral infection. We previously described how DFMO reduces CVB3 replication in vitro and in vivo [25] . Here, we show that CVB3 gains resistance to DFMO-mediated polyamine depletion via two distinct and independent mutations. Such emergence of resistance highlights that polyamine depletion as a monotherapy may not be sufficient to quell virus replication. As viruses rapidly mutate and gain resistance to antivirals, potential therapy that includes polyamine depletion would necessitate combination therapy to prevent resistance. Neither protease mutant exhibited an enhanced fitness phenotype, as we had observed with CHIKV mutants [31] , suggesting that even if this virus were to emerge, the mutation may not fix in a viral population not exposed to DFMO.

Beyond underscoring combination therapy, viral escape mutants are powerful tools for understanding how antivirals function during viral infection. By investigating how CVB3 escaped DFMO-mediated polyamine depletion, we observed novel mutations in viral proteases that led us to investigate how polyamines contribute to viral protease activity. Thus, these escape mutants have highlighted a novel function of polyamines during viral infection. As described above, these results have implications for antiviral therapy, but they also inform our understanding of basic mechanisms in virology. Additional mechanisms whereby polyamines function in virus infection may be observed using similar means to highlight how these relatively simple molecules contribute to infection in diverse ways. 

Editorial Tobacco Induced Diseases COVID-19 and smoking: A systematic review of the evidence

non-survivors (p=0.21) with regard to mortality from COVID-19. Similarly, Zhang et al. 10 presented clinical characteristics of 140 patients with COVID-19. The results showed that among severe patients (n=58), 3.4% were current smokers and 6.9% were former smokers, in contrast to non-severe patients (n=82) among which 0% were current smokers and 3.7% were former smokers , leading to an OR of 2.23; (95% CI: 0.65-7.63; p=0.2). Huang et al. 11 studied the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 among 41 patients. In this study, none of those who needed to be admitted to an ICU (n=13) was a current smoker. In contrast, three patients from the non-ICU group were current smokers, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups of patients (p=0.31), albeit the small sample size of the study. The largest study population of 1099 patients with COVID-19 was provided by Guan et al. 12 from multiple regions of mainland China. Descriptive results on the smoking status of patients were provided for the 1099 patients, of which 173 had severe symptoms, and 926 had non-severe symptoms. Among the patients with severe symptoms, 16.9% were current smokers and 5.2% were former smokers, in contrast to patients with non-severe symptoms where 11.8% were current smokers and 1.3% were former smokers. Additionally, in the group of patients that either needed mechanical ventilation, admission to an ICU or died, 25.5% were current smokers and 7.6% were former smokers. In contrast, in the group of patients that did not have these adverse outcomes, only 11.8% were current smokers and 1.6% were former smokers. No statistical analysis for evaluating the association between the severity of the disease outcome and smoking status was conducted in that study. Finally, Liu et al. 13 found among their population of 78 patients with COVID-19 that the adverse outcome group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking (27.3%) than the group that showed improvement or stabilization (3.0%), with this difference statistically significant at the p=0.018 level. In their multivariate logistic regression analysis, the history of smoking was a risk factor of disease progression (OR=14.28; 95% CI: 1.58-25.00; p= 0.018).

We identified five studies that reported data on the smoking status of patients infected with COVID-19. Notably, in the largest study that assessed severity, there were higher percentages of current and former smokers among patients that needed ICU support, mechanical ventilation or who had died, and a higher percentage of smokers among the severe cases 12 . However, from their published data we can calculate that the smokers were 1.4 times more likely (RR=1.4, 95% CI: 0.98-2.00) to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to be admitted to an ICU, need mechanical ventilation or die compared to non-smokers (RR=2.4, 95% CI: 1.43-4.04).

In conclusion, although further research is warranted as the weight of the evidence increases, with the limited available data, and although the above results are unadjusted for other factors that may impact disease progression, smoking is most likely associated with the negative progression and adverse outcomes of COVID-19. 

Genetic diversity, infection prevalence, and possible transmission routes of Bartonella spp. in vampire bats

Bartonella spp. are globally distributed bacteria that cause endocarditis in humans and domestic animals. Recent work has suggested bats as zoonotic reservoirs of some human Bartonella infections; however, the ecological and spatiotemporal patterns of infection in bats remain largely unknown. Here we studied the genetic diversity, prevalence of infection across seasons and years, individual risk factors, and possible transmission routes of Bartonella in populations of common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) in Peru and Belize, for which high infection prevalence has previously been reported. Phylogenetic analysis of the gltA gene for a subset of PCR-positive blood samples revealed sequences that were related to Bartonella described from vampire bats from Mexico, other Neotropical bat species, and streblid bat flies. Sequences associated with vampire bats clustered significantly by country but commonly spanned Central and South America, implying limited spatial structure. Stable and nonzero Bartonella prevalence between years supported endemic transmission in all sites. The odds of Bartonella infection for individual bats was unrelated to the intensity of bat flies ectoparasitism, but nearly all infected bats were infested, which precluded conclusive assessment of support for vector-borne transmission. While metagenomic sequencing found no strong evidence of Bartonella DNA in pooled bat saliva and fecal samples, we detected PCR positivity in individual saliva and feces, suggesting the potential for bacterial transmission through both direct contact (i.e., biting) and environmental (i.e., fecal) exposures. Further investigating the relative contributions of direct contact, environmental, and vector-borne transmission for bat Bartonella is an important next step to predict infection dynamics within bats and the risks of human and livestock exposures.

Bartonella are globally distributed bacteria that can cause endocarditis in humans and domestic animals. Bats have been implicated as a likely reservoir host for these bacteria, but little is known about how prevalence varies over time, routes of transmission, and the genetic diversity of Bartonella in bats. We present results from a two-year, spatially replicated study of common vampire bats, which have previously shown high infection prevalence of Bartonella and could pose risks of cross-species transmission due to their diet of mammal blood. We found that vampire bat Bartonella is genetically diverse, geographically widespread and endemic, and that individual-level infection risk is highest for large, male, non-reproductive bats. Phylogenetic analysis supported vector-borne transmission, and we found support for potential transmission through direct contact and fecal exposures through PCR. Confirming whether arthropod vectors are the main route of transmission for bat Bartonella is needed for understanding infection dynamics in bats and for predicting risks of cross-species transmission to humans and livestock.

Bartonella in vampire bats PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.

Introduction Bats (Order: Chiroptera) serve as reservoir hosts for viruses of concern for human and animal health [1, 2] including SARS coronavirus, rabies virus, filoviruses, and henipaviruses [3] [4] [5] [6] . Bats can also harbor protozoa and bacteria of potential zoonotic relevance [7] [8] [9] . Bartonella spp. are of particular interest, as these Gram-negative bacteria cause bacteremia and endocarditis in both humans and livestock [10, 11] and exhibit high genetic diversity in bats across multiple continents and species [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Moreover, phylogenetic analyses show bats are reservoirs of zoonotic Candidatus B. mayotimonensis [18] [19] [20] , a causative agent of human endocarditis [21] .

Given the zoonotic potential of bat-associated Bartonella, understanding transmission within bats is critical for understanding how Bartonella persists in bat populations and for assessing spillover risks [22, 23] . Ectoparasites are frequently invoked as a transmission route [12, 19, 24] , in part because vector-borne transmission occurs in other taxa [25, 26] and because Bartonella has been identified in bat flies and ticks [27] [28] [29] . While some bat ticks can feed on humans [30] , the high host specificity of bat flies [31, 32] could limit opportunities for crossspecies transmission through ectoparasites [31] [32] [33] . Transmission through close contact (e.g., biting) could occur given detection of Bartonella in dog and cat saliva [34, 35] as well as human infection following scratches from dogs and cats [36] . Phylogenetic patterns of weak Bartonella host specificity in Neotropical bat communities could not only reflect transmission through close contacts between species in multi-species roosts, but could also stem from transmission through generalist vectors [15, 24, 37] . Bartonella might also be transmitted through exposure to feces between bats and to humans that enter roosts or to domestic animals exposed to bat feces [18, 38] .

In addition to the potential risks of cross-species transmission from bats to livestock and humans, the infection dynamics of Bartonella in bats are also uncertain. In rodents, Bartonella prevalence varies through time [39, 40] , but such patterns have not been well studied in bats [41] . Individual heterogeneities in infection by age and sex could also inform exposure patterns. Finally, global analyses suggest geographic structure in bat Bartonella genotypes, with notable differences in genotypes from Latin American and those from Africa, Europe, and Asia [42] . However, as such patterns appear driven by bat families restricted to different continents, analyses within narrower geographic and taxonomic ranges could inform the scale of Bartonella transmission and the role that dispersal plays in the spatial dynamics of this infection [43] .

Common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) have high prevalence of Bartonella throughout their large geographic range in Latin America [15, 16, 24, 44] . Vampire bats are of particular concern because they subsist on blood, which could create opportunities for Bartonella transmission to humans and livestock either from bites during blood feeding or through vector sharing facilitated by close proximity [45] [46] [47] [48] . Here, we capitalize on a two-year, spatially replicated study of vampire bats to examine the genetic diversity and infection prevalence of Bartonella, including its geographic structure across the vampire bat range as well as individual and temporal correlates of infection status. To explore possible transmission routes of this bacterial pathogen, we also test for associations between bat fly infestation and Bartonella infection status, which would support vector-borne transmission, and by screening bat saliva and fecal samples for evidence of Bartonella DNA, which would support transmission through bites or grooming and environmental exposure to bacteria shed in feces, respectively.

Samples were collected as described in Becker et al. [49] . We sampled sites one to two times annually, capturing one to 17 individuals per site and sampling interval (S1 Table) . To screen for Bartonella by PCR, up to 30 μL blood was stored on Whatman FTA cards at room temperature. To assess the presence of Bartonella in saliva and feces, we collected oral and rectal swabs from vampire bats in Peru. Swabs were preserved in 2 mL RNAlater (Invitrogen) at -80˚C until laboratory analyses. For Peru sites sampled in 2016, we also recorded the number of bat flies per vampire bat [32] .

Field procedures were approved by the University of Georgia Animal Care and Use Committee (A2014 04-016-Y3-A5) and the University of Glasgow School of Medical Veterinary and Life Sciences Research Ethics Committee (Ref08a/15); all procedures were conducted in accordance with accepted guidelines for humane wildlife research as outlined by the American Society of Mammalogists [50] . Bat capture, sample collection, and exportation were authorized by the Belize Forest Department under permits CD/60/3/15 (21) and WL/1/1/16 (17) 

We analyzed samples that were previously screened for the presence of Bartonella by Becker et al. [49] using nested PCR to amplify a region of the citrate synthase gene (gltA) [51] . Among the Bartonella-positive samples, we randomly selected 5-10 positive samples per site for Sanger sequencing (n = 51). PCR products were purified with DNA Clean & Concentrator Kits (Zymo Research) and sequenced in both directions at the Georgia Genomics Facility. Resulting chromatograms were checked for quality and trimmed using Geneious (Biomatters) [52] . Post-trimmed forward and reverse sequences were assembled to create 348 base pair (bp) consensus sequences for each sample (n = 35; the quality of 16 chromatograms was too low).

Sequences were considered part of the same genotype if they had >96% identity in gltA, an established cut-off for Bartonella species identification [53] . Sequences with >99.7% similarity were considered the same genetic variant [54] . We used a Chi-squared test with the p value generated via a Monte Carlo procedure with 1000 simulations [55] to assess whether our defined Bartonella genotypes were associated with region (i.e., Belize, eastern Peruvian Amazon, western Peruvian Amazon).

Two datasets were created for phylogenetic analyses. Dataset 1 was designed to assess the spatial structure of vampire bat-associated Bartonella across Latin America and therefore included our new sequences plus all previously reported gltA sequences from Desmodus rotundus. Dataset 2 was designed to capture the relatedness of the new sequences to all previously described Bartonella spp. regardless of isolation source, which comprised sequences generated in this study plus sequences obtained by conducting a BLAST search of each new sequence against GenBank, selecting the top 10 hits, and removing duplicates. For both datasets, consensus sequences were aligned using MAFFT. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out in MrBayes using the GTR+gamma model suggested by jModeltest2 [56] . For dataset 1 (Desmodus-associated sequences), we fit a codon partitioned substitution model by linking rates in codon positions 1 and 2 separately from codon position 3. For dataset 2, we used a simpler non-partitioned model because the more complex codon-partitioned model failed to converge. Dataset 2 included one sequence from Brucella abortus (Genbank Locus: MIJI01000003.1) as an outgroup [13] . Both datasets were run for 2.5 million generations with convergence checked and burn-in periods selected by assessing posterior traces in Tracer [57] . With dataset 1, we analyzed spatial clustering of vampire bat Bartonella by country (Belize, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru) using Bayesian Tip Association Significance Testing (BaTS) [58] . We here selected 1,000 trees from the posterior distribution of the MrBayes run and compared the country-level clustering to a null distribution from 10,000 trees with swapped tip associations [58] .

We analyzed 193 samples from Desmodus rotundus to test whether temporal variation (season and year) and individual risk factors (e.g., age, sex) explain differences in Bartonella infection, using generalized mixed effects models (GLMMs) with binomial errors and a logit link fit with the lme4 package in R [59, 60] . We fit a single GLMM with an interaction between site and year to first test if prevalence varied over years across sampling locations; we excluded one site from this analysis (i.e., LR6) owing to sampling in only 2015. We included bat identification number (ID) as a random effect to account for multiple sampling of a small number of bats (n = 6). To assess seasonality in infection, we fit a separate GLMM with season (spring, summer, fall) as a predictor to data from two sites in Peru (AM1 and CA1) sampled across seasons (n = 63). We also fit a generalized additive model (GAM) with restricted maximum likelihood, binomial response, and a cyclic cubic regression spline for Julian date using the mgcv package [61] . We randomly selected repeatedly sampled bats, as including bat ID as a random effect here overfit the GAM.

To identify individual risk factors for Bartonella infection, we fit a single GLMM with bat age, forearm size, sex, and reproductive status; we also included interactions between sex and reproduction, sex and age, sex and forearm size, and reproduction and forearm size. We included categorical livestock biomass as a predictor in the GLMM to control for a previously observed negative association with Bartonella infection (121/173 positive bats) [49] . We fit this GLMM to a reduced dataset free of missing values (n = 189), included bat ID nested within site as a random effect, and calculated marginal R 2 (R 2 m ) to assess model fit [62] . Finally, for a data subset (n = 40 bats sampled in Peru in 2016), we fit two separate GLMs with bat fly intensity and presence as predictors to test whether ectoparasites explained Bartonella infection status. We fit a separate GLM with quasi-Poisson errors to test for sex and age differences in bat fly intensity.

To examine possible transmission of Bartonella through biting, grooming, blood sharing, or fecal-oral exposure, we used metagenomic data from a parallel study to screen vampire bat saliva and fecal samples for Bartonella DNA. Three saliva and three fecal pools were shotgun sequenced, each containing nucleic acid extractions from swabs collected from ten vampire bats from one to two colonies. Pooled samples contained individuals from the same colonies of bats tested for Bartonella in blood through PCR, though not necessarily the same individuals.

As described previously [8] , total nucleic acid was extracted from swabs and pooled equally according to RNA concentration. Pooled samples were DNAse treated and ribosomal RNA depleted, then cDNA synthesis was performed. Libraries were prepared using a KAPA DNA Library Preparation Kit for Illumina (KAPA Biosystems) modified for low input samples, and were individually barcoded during the PCR reamplification step [10] . The libraries included in this study were combined in equimolar ratios with other metagenomic libraries for sequencing on an Illumina NextSeq500 at the University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research.

Reads were demultiplexed according to barcode and quality filtered using TrimGalore [63, 64] with a quality threshold of 25, minimum read length of 75 bp, and clipping the first 14 bp of the read. Low complexity reads were filtered out using the DUST method and PCR duplicates removed using PRINSEQ [65] . We screened cleaned reads for the Bartonella genotypes detected in this study using nucleotide BLAST [66] against a custom database composed of the PCR-generated Bartonella sequences from this study, retaining only the best alignment (the high-scoring segment pair with the lowest e-value) for a single query-subject pair. To investigate the presence of Bartonella species other than genotypes detected in blood samples from vampire bats, cleaned reads were de novo assembled into contigs using the assembly only function of SPAdes [67] . Individual reads and contigs were screened for sequences matching Bartonella using protein alignment in Diamond [68] , and close matches at the protein level were further characterized by nucleotide BLAST against the Genbank nt database. As the gltA gene is not highly transcribed, we also tested sequences for matches to Bartonella DNAdirected RNA polymerase subunit B (rpoB). We selected two rpoB sequences (Genbank accessions KY629892 and KY629911) from a study of vampire bat Bartonella [16] for which the same individuals exhibited 100% identity in the gltA gene to our blood sequences, and we used Bowtie2 to map quality filtered reads and contigs to those sequences [69] .

Lastly, because nucleic acid pools were DNase treated for metagenomic sequencing, potentially reducing detection sensitivity, we used the same nested PCR protocol as used for bloodderived DNA [51] to test for the presence of gltA in DNA from individual saliva and fecal swab samples that made up metagenomic pools (n = 58; 28 saliva and 30 feces). As with our blood samples, we randomly selected a subset of positive amplicons for Sanger sequencing.

Bartonella prevalence across the 193 vampire bats included in this study was 67%. Our phylogenetic analysis of 35 vampire bat Bartonella sequences showed 78.8-100% pairwise identity in gltA and revealed at least 11 paraphyletic genotypes (S2 Table) . BaTS analysis of all Desmodus-associated Bartonella showed significant phylogenetic clustering by country (association index = 3.81, parsimony score = 31.51, p<0.001), although most vampire bat Bartonella genotypes were still widely distributed (Fig 1) . For the 11 genotypes delineated from our 35 sequences, we observed no association with the geographic study region (χ 2 = 23.3, p = 0.27). Genotypes 1 and 2 were detected across all regions, and genotypes 7-10 were detected within both Belize and Peru, highlighting the broad distribution of vampire bat Bartonella genotypes (Fig 2) ; however, genotype 3 was unique to both regions of Peru, genotypes 4-6 were unique to the western Peruvian Amazon, and genotype 11 was only detected in Belize.

We also assessed the phylogenetic position of our vampire bat Bartonella sequences among known Bartonella genotypes (Fig 3, S3 Table) . Half of our Peruvian and Belizian sequences (18/35) were nearly identical (>99.7% identity) to Bartonella from common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) from Mexico (e.g., GenBank accession numbers KY629837 and MF467803), again confirming the wide geographic distribution of these genotypes. Other sequences(9/35) fell within the same clade (>96% pairwise identity) as Bartonella from bat flies (Strebla diaemi) in Panama (JX416251), from Parnell's mustached bat (Pteronotus parnellii) in Mexico (e.g., KY629828), from phytophagous bats in Peru (e.g., Carollia perspicillata; JQ071384) and Guatemala (e.g., Glossophaga soricina; HM597202), or from Mexican vampire bats as noted above. Eight sequences were novel (<96% identity to GenBank sequences) but were most similar to Bartonella from phytophagous bats in Costa Rica (e.g., 90-93% to KJ816666 [Anoura geoffroyi]) and from Mexican vampire bats (e.g., 93% to MF467776).

Other novel sequences were weakly related to B. bovis from livestock in Israel and Malaysia (e.g., 89-90% to KJ909844 and KR733183), to B. chomelii from cattle in Spain (e.g., 89% to KM215693), to B. capreoli from elk in the United States (e.g., 89% to HM167503), and to B. schoenbuchensis from roe deer in Germany (e.g., 89% to AJ278186); indeed, posterior support for a bat-ruminant clade was low (<50%; Fig 3) . Our BLAST procedure also identified weakly related Bartonella from rodents (e.g., 90% to Rattus norvegicus from the United States [KC763951] and 92% to Apodemus agrarius from China [KX549996]) and from carnivores (e.g., 89% to Procyon lotor from the United States [CP019786]). However, these livestock, rodent, and carnivore sequences formed separate phylogenetic clades from bat-and bat flyderived Bartonella sequences (Fig 3) . Despite the geographic proximity of our field sites to Brazil, our BLAST procedure found no Bartonella seqeunces similar to those recently described in Brazilian bat or rodent species [70] [71] [72] . An additional phylogenetic tree that includes these recently identified Bartonella is provided in S1 Fig.

Bartonella was detected by PCR in all nine sites in each year, with prevalence ranging from 30-100% (Fig 4) . 

After controlling for site-level livestock biomass, vampire bat sex and forearm size were the strongest predictors of infection ( Fig 5) ; no interactions were significant (all χ 2 1.18, p!0.28) and were dropped from the final GLMM (R 2 m = 0.28). The odds of Bartonella infection were highest for vampire bats with larger forearms (OR = 1.2, p<0.001) and for males (OR = 5.41, p<0.01), were marginally higher for non-reproductive individuals (OR = 2.36, p = 0.10), and did not differ between subadult and adult bats (OR = 1.58, p = 0.38); our sample did not contain juveniles. Individual bat fly intensities were highly variable (0-28, median = 7.5) and showed overdispersion (ϕ = 5.08 in an intercept-only quasi-Poisson GLM). The bat fly GLMs showed that neither ectoparasite intensity (OR = 0.98, p = 0.81) nor ectoparasite presence (χ 2 = 1.13, p = 0.29) were associated with Bartonella infection status. We note that the majority of infected bats in this sample were infested with at least one bat fly (31/36), limiting conclusive assessment of the ectoparasite-infection relationship. Our multivariable quasi-Poisson GLM showed that ectoparasite load did not vary by bat sex (χ 2 = 0.86, p = 0.35) or bat age (χ 2 = 0.09, p = 0.77).

There were no matches in any of the screened saliva and fecal metagenomic pools to the Bartonella gltA sequences detected in the blood or to previously published Bartonella rpoB sequences. The saliva pool from Amazonas had no matching Bartonella-like reads or contigs (S4 Table) , while one read each from the Loreto and Cajamarca saliva pool was assigned as Bartonella by nucleotide BLAST; however, these reported species assignments should be Table) . Bartonella sequences from this study are displayed with genotype, bat ID numbers, and accession numbers. Sequences from GenBank are colored by host taxa and provided with accession numbers, species, and sampling location. Diamonds depict posterior probabilities of nodes greater than 50%. interpreted cautiously as they are based on one read and percent identity was low. Pooled fecal samples from all departments of Peru contained Bartonella-like reads and contigs. Bartonella ancashensis, B. australis, and B. bacilliformis were all identified at both the read and contig level in fecal samples. However, because percent identity was relatively low, species assignments should again be interpreted cautiously. Subsequent BLAST hits following the top hit also frequently (though not always) matched to Bartonella, suggesting the presence of poorly characterized Bartonella species present or that these may be matches to other bacteria.

In contrast, nested PCR of individual swabs detected gltA in 21.4% of saliva samples (6/28) and 30% of fecal samples (9/30). For swab samples that were also assessed by PCR in blood (n = 15 for saliva, n = 28 for feces), both corresponding positive saliva samples were positive in blood; most positive fecal samples were also PCR positive in blood, although one fecal-positive sample was PCR negative in blood (S4 Fig). For our random subset of sequenced positive saliva (n = 4) and fecal (n = 5) samples, phylogenetic analyses suggested that all sequences shared a minimum of 97% identity to one or more of our 35 blood-derived Bartonella sequences (S5 Table, Fig 6) . In many cases, saliva and fecal sequences were the same genotype as blood sequences derived from the same geographic region (e.g., the saliva sequence from D234 shared >96% identity to the blood sequence from D98, both from AM1). For the one case in which we sequenced positive samples from the same individual bat (i.e., D203), both the blood sequence and fecal sequence shared 100% identity (S5 Table, Fig 6) . For the few sequences at the lower range of our similarity spectrum, BLAST still demonstrated that the closest relatives were all derived from vampire bats (i.e., 8368 from CA1 was identical to MF467797 from Mexico).

Despite an increasing focus on Bartonella genetic diversity and prevalence in bat communities, individual risk factors and transmission routes of this pathogen in bats remain largely unknown. For example, a survey of vampire bats within Guatemala found neither geographic, dietary, demographic, or viral coinfection correlates of Bartonella infection status [44] . Using a larger sample across a more diverse range of study sites and timepoints, we here show that Bartonella is genetically diverse, geographically widespread and endemic within vampire bat populations, and that individual-level odds of infection are highest for large, male, and nonreproductive bats. Furthermore, we use several approaches to suggest vector-borne transmission to be likely in addition to possible direct contact and environmental sources of Bartonella exposure in bats.

The Bartonella genotypes we identified were paraphyletic and closely related to those from other vampire bat populations, other Neotropical bat species, or bat flies. Although BLAST also identified Bartonella spp. sequenced from rodents, carnivores, and livestock within our hit selection criteria, these consistently formed separate phylogenetic clades that did not contain bat-or bat fly-derived Bartonella (Fig 3) . These phylogenetic patterns indicate that Bartonella has commonly shifted between bat host species in the Americas but do not support frequent transmission between bats and other host groups. Our BaTS analysis also showed that vampire bat Bartonella sequences clustered by country more than expected by chance. However, given that several Bartonella genotypes were present in vampire bats from both Central and South America, we suspect this clustering mostly resulted from variation in locally abundant genotypes rather than true barriers to the spread of Bartonella. Because vampire bats are largely sedentary and non-migratory [45] , dispersal of these Bartonella genotypes across large distances is unlikely to be attributable to bat movement alone. Bartonella genotypes may also have infected vampire bats over long evolutionary timescales, and thus the biogeography of the pathogen may have followed that of its host. Alternatively, Bartonella dispersal by other arthropod vectors (e.g., ticks) or other bat species that share Bartonella genotypes with vampire bats may be conceivable and could be resolved by further field surveys combined with population genetic analyses of alternative bat host species, arthropod vector species, and Bartonella genotypes.

Few studies have examined temporal patterns of bat Bartonella, emphasizing the general need for more longitudinal studies to understand how pathogens persist in bat populations [1, 6] . Here, Bartonella was detected at relatively high prevalence across both study years within each sampling site, and neither year nor its interaction with site were predictive within our analyses. Similarly, no temporal patterns in Bartonella were observed for a limited sample of Myotis mystacinus, Pipistrellus spp., Myotis daubentonii, and Nyctalus noctula in the United Kingdom [41] . Such findings contrast with highly seasonal Bartonella infections in rodents, which show high prevalence in summer and fall due to seasonality in birth and ectoparasite intensity [39, 40] . The lack of seasonality in our western Peruvian Amazon sample in particular could simply be due to low statistical power; alternatively, no seasonality in infection could also be explained by the non-seasonal or less-pronounced birth pulses observed for vampire bats (but see [73] ). While high Bartonella prevalence in bats has been proposed to stem from persistent infection [15] , this seems unlikely, as we observed possible clearance of infection in some recaptured bats. While this could also reflect bacteria DNA loads too low to be detected by PCR, infection risk did not increase with age, as would also be expected if bats could not clear infection [74] . However, we do note that our sample only contained adult (n = 162) and subadult (n = 28) bats, limiting more robust tests of age-dependent infection. Alternatively, Bartonella infections could be chronic and vary in infection intensity over time or could become latent (i.e., be undetectable in erythrocytes but persist in endothelial cells), particularly as infection does not appear to confer long-term immunity [36] . Such explanations could be confronted in future work with larger sample sizes of recaptured bats, multiple assessments of infection status over time, and quantitative PCR.

Bat forearm size, sex, and reproductive status were important predictors of Bartonella infection status, with odds of infection being higher in larger, male, and non-reproductive bats. While subadult status itself was not an important predictor of Bartonella infection, these findings could suggest higher risk in young male bats that are relatively large for their age. Our previous work has shown stronger innate immune defense (i.e., bacterial killing ability) in reproductive (mostly male) vampire bats, also suggesting greater susceptibility of non-reproductive hosts [49] . Similarly, subadults across a Mexican bat community also had higher odds of Bartonella infection [16] , and young male vampire bats play key roles in the long-distance dispersal of rabies virus [43] and display higher rates of rabies exposure, possibly owing to more direct contacts during the first year of life [75] . Larger forearm size could also relate to direct contact if larger bats are more dominant and aggressive, as found in other phyllostomid bat species [76] .

Although vector-borne transmission is generally assumed for Bartonella in other hosts [12, 19, 25, 77] , including some Neotropical bats [16, 78] , infection status in vampire bats was not associated with bat fly intensity. Further supporting this observation, male bats had higher odds of Bartonella infection but did not differ in their bat fly intensities compared to females. Weak correspondence between bat fly intensity at the time of sampling and Bartonella infection thus may cast doubt on bat flies as a primary transmission route. Time lags could provide one reason for this discrepancy, given that new Bartonella infections may take days or weeks to develop and become detectable and over which time ectoparasite load may have changed due to the mobile nature of bat flies [26, 36, 79] . On the other hand, it is possible that vector presence (rather than abundance) is a more important driver of transmission. Unfortunately, nearly all bats in this study had ectoparasites, so comparisons of Bartonella presence in bats with and without bat flies had little statistical power (31/36 Bartonella-positive bats were infested with at least one bat fly). Given that ectoparasitism predicted Bartonella infection more generally across a Mexian bat community [16] , larger sample sizes with greater variation in bat fly intensity could provide better inference. However, our phylogenetic analysis does provide a tentative line of evidence supporting vector-borne transmission, as several of Bartonella genotypes fell within the same clade as Bartonella from streblid bat flies [29] . A recent survey of Mexican bats and their sympatric bat flies suggested that corresponding hosts and their bat flies had varied Bartonella genotypes, although one vampire bat did show complete sequence homology with the Bartonella from its paired bat flies [37] . As genetic similarity between Bartonella in bat flies and hosts has been interpreted as evidence of vector-borne transmission in other bat species [29, 54] , further assessments of Bartonella genotypes between vampire bats and their various ectoparasites (bat flies but also ticks) would shed additional light on possible routes of vector-borne transmission.

Lastly, we analyzed bat saliva and feces using metagenomics and PCR to explore alternative transmission routes, namely through close contact and fecal exposure. Metagenomics detected no Bartonella DNA matching to gltA or rpoB in either saliva or fecal pools. This absence could be explained in that the short sequences (345-425 bp) used as targets, and the large size of bacterial genomes together make the likelihood of detecting a specific gene low. However, the Bartonella-like reads and contigs recovered from saliva and feces were short fragments (51-258 bp) and showed low homology to known Bartonella from GenBank (S4 Table) . Notably, we used a similar approach to search for other bacteria (i.e., hemoplasmas) and found clear evidence of their presence [8] . While this could suggest true absence of Bartonella from bat saliva and feces, our PCR found Bartonella in a subset of individual saliva and fecal samples. This discrepancy between methods could stem from treating saliva and fecal pools with DNase before metagenomic sequencing. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses confirmed that these sequences were closely related to those identified in blood, which argues against these PCR positives only representing bacteria derived from environmental contamination or from feeding on prey. PCR results further showed strong correspondence between blood and saliva, suggesting that Bartonella infection may be systemic in vampire bats. While fecal and blood PCR results also mostly matched, we found one case where a bat was negative in blood but positive in feces. As consumption of ectoparasites during grooming has been observed in other bat families (e.g., Pteropodidae [80] ), this discrepancy could suggest the incidental ingestion of ectoparasites during grooming and that this does not lead to systemic infection more generally indicated by the concordance between blood, saliva, and fecal positives and their close genetic similarity.

Similar prevalence of Bartonella in saliva and feces suggests that direct contact and environmental exposure could serve as complemenry transmission routes to arthropod vectors. The presence of Bartonella in saliva samples contrasts with previous work showing an absence of Bartonella in vampire bat saliva [44, 81] , providing evidence for possible direct transmission. Bartonella in fecal samples could also suggest environmental transmission between bats [18] . Both saliva-borne and fecal-oral transmission of vampire bat Bartonella could further pose potential risks to humans or livestock, either through bites during feeding or by environmental exposure of humans that enter roosts or to domestic animals exposed to bat feces [18, 38, 48, 82] . For the former pathway, however, a recent survey of Bartonella in Mexican ruminants did not identify being bitten by vampire bats as a risk factor for infection [81] , and our phylogenetic results provide relatively more support for the possibility of vector-borne transmission. Vector-borne transmission of vampire bat Bartonella might reduce their potential to infect humans or livestock, given the high host specificity of most bat flies [31, 32] . However, ectoparasite transfer between individuals could still occur during pupal deposition and close contact [83] , facilitating Bartonella transmission within vampire bat colonies and to other bat species. While our analyses of ectoparasitism only considered bat flies, we have observed heavy tick burdens of vampire bats in other field sites (e.g., Belize). Bartonella has been detected in ticks infesting other bats [28] , and these ectoparasites could also be more likely to facilitate cross-species transmission [30] . Metagenomics also potentially identified Bartonella ancashensis and B. bacilliformis in vampire bat fecal samples, and these species cause notable infectious disease in humans likely through phlebotomine sand flies in Andean regions of Peru [84, 85] . Controlled infection trials and more extensive phylogenetic analyses of Bartonella in vampire bats, their various ectoparasites, and sympatric prey are therefore needed to examine the contributions of different transmission routes for bacterial spread within vampire bats and to recipient prey and to confirm whether saliva and feces represent viable transmission routes. Given the high rates of bat bites and proximity to wildlife, humans, and domestic animals that define vampire bat ecology, such efforts to verify the possibility and frequency of oral and environmental exposures would elucidate Bartonella transmission dynamics in this common host species and the risks of cross-species transmission.

Enhancement of wildlife disease surveillance using multiplex quantitative PCR: development of qPCR assays for major pathogens in UK squirrel populations

Rapid development in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology has revolutionised the speed and accuracy of many diagnostic assays. However, comparatively few wildlife epidemiological studies use quantitative PCR (qPCR) for pathogen detection, even fewer employ an internal control, to ensure confidence in negative results, and PCR's ability to multiplex and therefore detect several targets in a single reaction is underutilised. Here, we describe the development of two multiplex qPCR assays for the red and grey squirrel that detect the pathogens squirrelpox virus (SQPV) and adenovirus in squirrels (SADV), both of which cause mortality in the red squirrel. Both assays use a section of the squirrel phosphoglycerate kinase gene as an endogenous internal control that identifies and compensates for both, inadequate sampling or PCR inhibition. Tests on infected squirrel tissue demonstrate that simple swab samples (particularly from distal antebrachial skin) are sufficient to detect and identify the relative quantity of SQPV DNA in both squirrel species, while rectal swabs and blood cell pellets can be used to reliably indicate SADV infection. These assays are sensitive and specific with an endogenous internal control providing confidence in negative results and allowing comparison across laboratories. Using such assays should prove advantageous in wildlife studies with limited resources while allowing the maximum data yield.

Effective wildlife disease surveillance is important, with links between wildlife and pathogens relevant to human and domestic animal health being commonly discovered, e.g. Echinococcus multilocularis (Hegglin et al. 2015) , SARS coronavirus (Bell and Roberton 2004) , avian influenza (Fouchier et al. 2004) , hantavirus (Watson et al. 2014) and Ebola (Leroy et al. 2005) . Wildlife disease surveillance thus forms an essential part of the 'One Health' theme (Thompson 2013) , with studies providing an opportunity to both benefit human health and the wildlife species in question (Jenkins et al. 2015) . To minimise transmission of pathogens between wildlife and livestock or humans, it is necessary to understand the species' ecology and pathogen transmission pathways (Boadella et al. 2011; Delahay et al. 2009 ). Any investigation of host-pathogen dynamics relies on a sensitive and specific detection assay (Boadella et al. 2011) , and yet application of current molecular techniques to wildlife disease epidemiology has been slow in comparison with studies of humans and livestock (Benton et al. 2015) .

Contemporary diagnostic tests for many pathogens rely on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as assays often yield excellent sensitivity and specificity (for both fresh and archived samples) and in less time than many traditional assays (Cai Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s10344-016-1031-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. et al. 2014) . In particular, quantitative PCR (qPCR) combines high-throughput sample processing with increased sensitivity and reduced potential for contamination (Klein 2002) . However, PCR can be prone to inhibition in all formats (Brankatschk et al. 2012; Schrader et al. 2012 ) and quality control is therefore vital during assay development and processing (Borst et al. 2004; Burkardt 2000; Lo and Chan 2006) . One key quality control measure is to include an internal control (IC) to minimise occurrence of false-negative results. ICs that consist of a known DNA sequence, added to the sample prior to or post-DNA purification (exogenous IC), are often convenient (e.g. in commercial kits) but may impair assay sensitivity (Cai et al. 2014 ). Alternatively, a region of the host's genomic DNA (reference gene) can be used as an IC (endogenous IC) to verify the absence of PCR inhibitors during sample processing; using an endogenous control prevents the need to add foreign DNA to the qPCR and allows calculation of relative quantity of target DNA. Internal endogenous controls are frequently used in gene expression studies but rarely used in pathogen detection assays. Multiplex PCRs can be used to detect simultaneously the target and endogenous IC sequences and thus save time and costs (Cai et al. 2014; Elnifro et al. 2000) .

Despite the putative advantages of qPCR assays, only 35 % (48/136) of reviewed studies of wildlife disease surveillance published since 2011 have used qPCR; furthermore, only 8 % (7/88) and 11 % (5/45) of conventional PCR and qPCR studies, respectively, used an IC. Use of a multiplex reaction was similarly limited, accounting for only 14 % (12/88) and 10 % (4/39), respectively, of wildlife disease surveillance studies. The implication is that contemporary techniques in molecular epidemiology are underutilised in wildlife disease surveillance (see also Benton et al. 2015) .

The Eurasian red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) in the UK, has suffered a severe reduction in its abundance and distribution (Bosch and Lurz 2012) , coinciding with the introduction of the non-native Eastern grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) in the 1900s (Gurnell and Pepper 1993; Usher et al. 1992) . A combination of modelling (Rushton et al. 2006; Tompkins et al. 2003) , experimental infection studies (Tompkins et al. 2002) and field data (Chantrey et al. 2014) indicates that a major part of the decline of UK red squirrel populations is due to infection by squirrelpox virus (SQPV). This pathogen is thought to have been introduced with the grey squirrel, a theory supported by a high prevalence of exposure despite an absence of clinical disease (Bruemmer et al. 2010; Sainsbury et al. 2000) , an association between seropositive grey squirrels and the appearance of clinical cases of squirrelpox in red squirrels (McInnes et al. , 2013 Sainsbury et al. 2008) and an association of the pathogen in both squirrel species during an outbreak of disease in red squirrels (Chantrey et al. 2014 ). Programmes to reintroduce red squirrels in the UK have been hampered by disease: by SQPV in Norfolk (Carroll et al. 2009 ) and adenovirus in squirrels (SADV) in other areas of the UK (Everest et al. 2008 (Everest et al. , 2012b Martinez-Jimenez et al. 2011 ). SADV appears to cause mortality in wild red squirrels (Duff et al. 2007; Everest et al. 2012a ), although the impact on a population scale is largely unknown with subclinical infections also reported (Everest et al. 2014) .

It is important that studies of this system are based on reliable and accurate diagnostics. SQPV infection status was initially determined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Scott and Keymer 1981) , but more recently conventional PCR ) and qPCR (Atkin et al. 2010; Fiegna et al. 2016 ) assays have been developed. As grey squirrels appear asymptomatic, lower infection loads are recorded, and thus it is essential to use the more sensitive qPCR assays when screening for SQPV presence as part of a wildlife disease management programme for red squirrels. For SADV infection, confirmation has relied on either TEM (Everest et al. 2008) or conventional qualitative PCR assays (Everest et al. 2009b) . No assay for either pathogen has incorporated an IC (either exogenous or endogenous). Additionally, the use of ICs to monitor squirrel pathogens is essential because staphylococcal exudative dermatitis (Simpson et al. 2010 (Simpson et al. , 2013a and rotaviral enteritis (Everest et al. 2009a) show similar lesions to SQPV and SADV, respectively. This presents a clear opportunity for misdiagnosis (in the absence of other diagnostic tests) if the pathogen assay reports a false negative, for example due to unrecognised presence of PCR inhibitors.

To encourage other wildlife disease surveillance studies to develop qPCR assays with the potential to detect multiple pathogens along with an IC to assess qPCR quality, we describe the development of two qPCR assays that are capable of detecting both SQPVand SADV in a sample from either red or grey squirrels. These assays thus present substantial improvements on current methods to detect these agents and will facilitate our understanding of the epidemiology of squirrel pathogens.

All qPCR reactions were carried out using white 96-well plates sealed with optical clear caps (Primer Design, Southampton, UK) and were run in a LightCycler® 480 II real-time cycler (Roche, Welwyn Garden City, UK), unless otherwise stated.

Potential gene targets for the endogenous control were identified from studies on other mammals (de Jonge et al. 2007 ). BLASTn (Altschul et al. 1990 ) was used to align gene sequences for the endogenous control candidates, using sequence data from the mouse (Mus musculus) and the 13lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus), the only available genome from the Sciuridae family (GenBank Accession number AGTP01000001-01024510) (Benson et al. 2010) . Conserved regions between the mouse and 13lined ground squirrel were assumed to be good candidates for sequence conservation between red and grey squirrels. Those conserved regions were then sequenced to investigate their suitability to amplify host DNA in a qPCR (as described in Online Resource S1).

AlleleID® v.7 (Premier Biosoft, CA, USA) was used to design primers and probes for qPCR against the (1) SQPV G8R gene (GenBank NC022563), (2) SADV DNA polymerase gene (GenBank JN205244), the targets for published assays (Atkin et al. 2010; Everest et al. 2009b) , and (3) the two endogenous IC sequences. A BLASTn search (Altschul et al. 1990 ) was used to confirm that primers and probes would not bind to non-target regions. Primers were tested with DNA from squirrels and with known positive and negative DNA templates. For SQPV, positive controls were those previously tested positive using the assay developed by Atkin et al. (2010) ; for SADV, positive controls were material that had shown a high SADV load by TEM. Reactions were initially run and optimised as uniplex reactions using Precision™ SYBR® Green Master Mix (Primer Design, Southampton, UK) using the reaction constituents and cycle parameters described in Online Resource S1. The optimum qPCR annealing temperature (T a ) was determined first using a 55-65°C temperature gradient, and amplicons were assessed also for specificity using a melt curve analysis (a single melt point was shown within the temperature predicted by the PCR design software). Primer concentrations were varied between 50 and 500 nM, with the primer concentration that gave the lowest crossing point (C p ) without the appearance of additional peaks in the no-template control (NTC) on the melt curve considered optimum.

The fluorescent reporter dyes were FAM (endogenous control), Texas Red (SQPV) and Cy5 (SADV), with quenchers BHQ-1, BHQ-2 and BHQ-3, respectively, chosen to ensure minimal spectral overlap (Marras 2006) . Hydrolysis probe sequences were designed concurrently with the primers using AlleleID® v.7 (Premier Biosoft, CA, USA) and were trialled first in uniplex using Precision™ Master Mix without SYBR® Green (Primer Design, Southampton, UK). Optimal probe concentrations were determined as for primer concentration optimisation. The optimal amount of sample (unknown quantity of target) genomic DNA per reaction was defined as the largest amount of total DNA that showed a low C p across all assays but which avoided excessive dilution of samples (thereby not affecting the analytical sensitivity of the assay).

An initial assessment of the ability of the assays to be multiplexed was carried out by comparing C p values obtained with the same DNA templates but with primers used in uniplex, duplex and triplex reactions. A mixture of previously identified positive samples was used to create a DNA template that was positive for the IC and both of the target genes. Multiplex qPCRs were run as 20 μl final reaction volumes that contained 4 μl 5 × QuantiTect® virus Master Mix (Qiagen, Manchester, UK), appropriate amounts of each primer and probe (Table 1 ) and ca. 50 ng template DNA. Thermal cycling conditions were 5 min at 95°C, followed by 50 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 75 s at 60 C. PCR efficiencies of reliable multiplex qPCRs were assessed using serial dilution of standards (10 7 -10 2 copies and 5 7 -5 2 copies) with five reactions per dilution. As neither virus is readily isolated in cell culture, we modified the qPCR protocol of O'Callaghan and Fenech (2011) to quantify the amount of target DNA. Briefly, known quantities of synthetic oligonucleotides (Eurofins MWG Operon, Edersberg, Germany, or Integrated DNA Technologies, Leuven, Belgium) (see Online Resource S2) for calculations to determine number of copies based on molecular weight of the oligonucleotides), whose single-stranded DNA sequences are those of the control and target genes that binds the probe, are used to create a standard curve against which the amount of target DNA in the unknown samples can be calculated (O'Callaghan and Fenech 2011). With no gold standard assay for either target and therefore no confidence about a 'truly negative' sample, Lambda (λ) DNA (Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) was added to the serial dilutions to ensure the same quantity of DNA overall in each qPCR (Online Resource S3). Only multiplex qPCRs with efficiencies between 90 and 110 % for all assays were retained.

The linear ranges of detection for the assays were determined using serial dilutions of the standards from 10 13 to 10 copies per reaction, and the limit of detection was established with twofold dilutions of standards from 100 to 1.0625 copies per reaction. Repeatability of the limit of detection was confirmed by making a further six triplicate reactions and further testing with the determined limit of detection with high levels (1.0 × 10 7 copies per reaction) of the 'other' two assayed genes.

Optimised assays were tested for pathogen specificity by seeding six qPCR reactions with DNA extracted from tissue infected with monkeypox virus (two tissue samples) and cowpox virus (two tissue samples) and individual cell culture isolates that contained canine adenovirus 1 and 2. The results of the new assays were compared with the SQPV PCR assay (Atkin et al. 2010 ) and TEM methods used to identify SADV (Everest et al. 2008 ). In the absence of a gold standard for both target pathogens, a test of agreement (Pfeiffer 2010) was performed to compare whether the assays similarly reported presence or absence of virus. When comparing qPCR assays, the quantitative values were investigated for correlation using a Pearson's correlation. All statistical analyses (including generating figures) were performed using R v.2.15.1 (R Core Team 2012). Where quoted, all confidence intervals (CI) are at the 95 % level.

All unknown sample extracts were run in triplicate with one NTC for each sample using the optimised qPCR protocol. Each reaction plate contained (1) a positive control for the target genes, (2) a standardised calibrator sample (1 × 10 7 copies of reference and target genes made up to 200 ng total DNA using λ DNA) and (3) a triplicate of a standard of known quantities of all assay genes. See Online Resource S4 for the layout of a typical sample plate. One standard curve (imported during software analysis) was used for analysis of several qPCR plates, rather than making a standard curve for each plate (allowing more samples per plate); this allowed the standard within the plate to act as a reference on the standard curve while the calibrator acted as a reference for inter-plate variation (see normalisation calculation below). The mean C p value was converted to a copy number and a normalised relative quantitative ratio (RQ) of the target gene to reference gene was then calculated using the following equation:

T Target copy number and R Reference gene copy number.

A sample was considered positive if two or three (of three) replicates amplified the target and there was no amplification in either of the NTC or the no-template batch extract. If only one reaction showed a positive amplification the sample was re-run and if the result was repeated the sample was classed as inconclusive.

Multiplex assay performance was further quantified using necropsy tissue samples with the aim of quantifying the infection load of tissues from red squirrel carcasses found during autumn 2011. Some squirrels were suspected to have SQPVor SADV based on gross lesions (skin ulcers or enteritis, respectively), while three red squirrels had no sign of disease (i.e. road casualties) and three red squirrels were selected on the basis that they had gross lesions not traditionally associated with either SQPV or SADV (skin or gastrointestinal inflammation, respectively). As grey squirrels rarely show clinical signs for either infection, 16 carcases were selected at random from samples submitted as part of a grey squirrel control programme (during autumn 2011). All squirrels had a systematic necropsy examination. Swabs (Dacron tip, Fisher Scientific UK Ltd., Loughborough, UK) were taken from sites believed to have a predilection for SQPV infection (i.e. oral/lip, eyelid and/or arm vibrissae) (Atkin et al. 2010) or SADV enteric infection (rectum). Corresponding skin samples were taken, along with flank and chest (vibrissae) skin samples for grey squirrels and nose, ear, digit, inguinal and genital skin samples for red squirrels. Submandibular lymph node, lung, heart, liver, kidney, spleen, stomach, small intestine (duodenum and jejunum), large intestine (caecum and colon), faeces, skeletal muscle and brain were all sampled. Blood was collected postmortem and serum was separated from the cell pellet by centrifugation (13,000 rpm for 10 min). All samples were stored at −20°C until DNA purification using a DNeasy® blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, Manchester, UK) and the manufacturer's protocol. DNA was extracted from swabs using protocol (a) in the Online Resource S5. DNA was isolated from the blood cell pellet using a FlexiGene DNA kit (Qiagen, Manchester, UK) following the protocol (b) in the Online Resource S5. A 'no sample' DNA extraction was completed in tandem with every batch of extractions to monitor potential contamination during DNA extractions.

The results of the trials to identify the best endogenous ICs are provided in the Online Resource S6 (Tables S6.1 and S6 .2): a section of the squirrel phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) gene was identified as an appropriate endogenous IC for both squirrel species.

Best multiplex primer and probe panels were derived from AlleleID® (Table 1 ; see Online Resource S7, Fig. S7 .1 for positions on control/target genes); secondary structures (hairpins, homo-and hetero-dimerization) of primers, probes and templates were assessed within the software used. All undesirable secondary structures had a delta G (ΔG) >−2 and melting temperature (T m ) at least 30°C less than the chosen T a . These suggested inhibitory secondary structures at the reaction temperature were highly unlikely to form and thus have little detrimental effect on the desired PCR reaction. PCR product sequences were confirmed to be the same as predicted target sequences (Online Resource S7, Fig. S7.2-7.7) . Brief comparisons between SYBR® green and hydrolysis probe methods demonstrated that both chemistries yielded comparable values of C p . Moreover, completing the assays as either duplexes or triplexes had little impact on C p values. (A summary of these results is provided in the Online Resource S8, Fig. S8 .1). Optimal primer/probe concentrations varied between 200 and 400 nm for uniplex reactions (Table 1) . While satisfactory efficiencies (i.e. E >90 % but <110 %) with duplex reactions were achieved using the same primer/probe concentrations as for uniplex reactions (see Online Resource S8, Fig. S8 .2-3 for standard curves), triplex reactions required primers and probes to be of equal concentration (200 nM; as per the manufacturer's recommendation) to achieve reaction efficiencies comparable to those recorded in duplex reactions (Fig. 1) . All assays had maximised amplification over a 5-10°C range in T a , with a T a of 60°C acceptable for all assays (Table 1) . A total of 200 ng of total DNA per reaction provided the best compromise between obtaining a low C p value and maintaining assay sensitivity for both multiplexes.

Non-specific binding was not evident (using agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR products) in samples assayed in uniplex, duplex or triplex analyses. That all assays amplified the correct target region was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Online Resource S7, Fig. S7 .2-S7.7). The assays appear specific to the intended squirrel pathogens, as neither SQPV nor SADV qPCR assays amplified (0/6 reactions) a product in qPCRs seeded with either cowpox, monkeypox or canine adenovirus 1 or 2 DNA.

The linear range of the assays between the C p value and the log of the target DNA for qPCRs was similar across all assays (Online Resource S9, Fig. S9 .1), containing between 10 2 and 10 10 copies of the target gene. The consistent, reliable limits of detection for the qPCR assays in both red and grey squirrels were estimated to be about 12 (PGK) or 6 (SQPV and SADV) copies per reaction.

Our assay detected SQPV with comparable results to the Atkin et al. (2010) SYBR® green assay, showing good qualitative agreement; k value (agreement) of 0.75 (n = 7) and 1.00 (n = 12) for grey and red squirrel assays, respectively. In comparing the quantitative values (i.e. C p values) of the developed SQPV assays and the Atkin et al. (2010) assay, strong correlation was witnessed (r = 1.00 and 0.99 for grey and red squirrel assays, respectively). By contrast, we found only moderate agreement between qualitative results of SADV detected in tissues by TEM and our assay results (k value = 0.39, n = 15; red squirrel SADV assay). In fact, none of the grey squirrel tissues tested (n = 5) showed evidence of SADV viral particles by TEM, which was not surprising due to the asymptomatic nature of the infection in the grey squirrel. By contrast, the k value between the developed red and grey squirrel SADV assays was 1 and it showed a strong correlation between quantitative results (r = 1.00, n = 15). Our uniplex and multiplex assays gave the same information about whether samples were positive or negative (k value = 1.00 (n = 8 per assay)) and displayed high correlations in the absolute quantification (i.e. C p values) of viral load (r = 0.82, 0.98 and 0.85 for grey squirrel assays and r = 0.98, 0.98 and 1.00 for red squirrel assays, with correlations displayed for tests of PGK, SQPV and ADV, respectively). When viral loads were calculated as RQ values, the correlation coefficients for comparison of uniplex and multiplex assays were r = 1.00 and 1.00 (n = 8) for grey squirrel SQPV and SADV assays and r = 0.85 and 1.00 (n = 8) for red squirrel SQPV and SADV assays, respectively.

All sample types investigated contained adequate amounts of squirrel DNA for amplification of the IC, with even those samples with expected low yields of squirrel DNA (cutaneous swabs, especially those from the arm area) amplifying the IC (see absolute quantification results, Online Resource S10, Fig. S10.1) .

SQPV infections were generally localised to cutaneous areas in grey squirrels (Fig. 2a, b) . Arm swabs gave the highest RQ (ratio of target (SQPV) to control gene (PGK)) (mean RQ = 0.18 ± 0.14 CI, n = 12) and the greatest proportion of positive results in infected grey squirrels (0.83 (10/12), 0.51-0.97 CI). Eyelid swabs also showed a relatively high RQ of SQPV DNA (mean RQ = 0.029 ± 0.027 CI, n = 12), although it appears the area is less frequently infected, with the proportion of positive results from eyelid swabs being lower (0.58 (7/12), 0.29-0.84 CI) than on the arm. Flank skin samples appeared to be commonly infected with the virus in infected individuals (0.75 (9/12), 0.43-0.93 CI) but with a low intensity of infection (RQ mean = 0.004 ± 0.007 CI, n = 12). Non-cutaneous samples showed low incidence and intensity of SQPV infection, with blood, stomach and skeletal muscle showing the highest prevalence of the virus in positive animals all ca. 0.3 (Fig. 2b) .

SADV infection also appears to be localised in grey squirrels, with the highest level of infection detected in rectal swab samples (RQ mean = 0.0009 ± 0.001 CI, n = 8), with 0.88 (7/8, 0.47-0.99 CI) of infected individuals showing presence of the virus on such swabs (Fig. 2c) . However, tissue samples from the gastrointestinal tract (i.e. stomach, large intestine and faeces) yielded low numbers of the virus (e.g. small intestine RQ mean = 0.00009 ± 0.0001 CI, n = 8) and with only a quarter (0.25 (2/8), 0.05-0.64 CI) of the infected grey squirrels showing a positive result in the small intestinal tissue. Interestingly, values of RQ in the spleen were somewhat higher (RQ mean = 0.0007 ± 0.0009 CI, n = 8), with viral presence in half (0.5 (4/8), 0.18-0.82 CI) of the SADV-positive animals. The findings in the spleen are also complemented with a high proportion of viral presence in the blood (0.86 (6/7), 0.42-0.99 CI, n = 7) all-be-it with relatively low quantity of virus (RQ mean = 0.0003 ± 0.0002 CI, n = 7). All other samples/tissues showed a low prevalence of infection (≤0.13 (1/8), 0.01-0.53 CI) (Fig. 2c) . 

Six red squirrels were submitted for post-mortem examination with gross skin lesions consistent with SQPV infection, and seven red squirrels were acquired with abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract that were compatible with a SADV infection. Of the three squirrels whose mortality was not thought related to SQPV or SADV infection, two had severe pediculosis and the other a severe pneumonia. As with the grey squirrels, swab samples effectively recovered both target and reference DNA in red squirrels, with only one arm swab failing to isolate squirrel DNA (n = 6 for each cutaneous swab site and n = 7 for rectal swabs) (see absolute quantification results in the Online Resource S10, Fig. S10.2) .

Cutaneous samples showed a greater RQ of SQPV DNA than other tissues. Arm skin had the highest RQ of SQPV DNA (RQ mean = 1937 ± 3692 CI, n = 7), and digit skin was the second most intensely infected area (RQ mean = 24 ± 24 CI, n = 4) (Fig. 3a) . Of all cutaneous swabs taken, arm swabs yielded the most SQPV DNA (RQ mean = 29 ± 47 CI, n = 6). It appears virus is present over much of the body with all cutaneous swabs and tissue showing 100 % SQPV presence in infected individuals. In contrast to grey squirrels, non-cutaneous samples also showed high infection rates in red squirrels but with somewhat lower infection intensities when compared to cutaneous samples (Fig. 3b) . For example, blood showed the highest RQ of the non-cutaneous tissues tested (RQ mean = 0.097 ± 0.16 CI, n = 7), while rectal swabs provided the highest recovery of SQPV DNA (RQ mean = 0.23 ± 0.33 CI, n = 7); indeed, the recovery of SQPV from rectum was comparable to the relative quantity of SQPV DNA found in faeces (RQ mean = 0.18 ± 0.22 CI, n = 5).

Samples from the gastrointestinal tract showed the greatest RQ and the highest proportion of viral presence in infected individuals with rectal swabs showing the highest recovery of SADV DNA (RQ mean = 81.09 ± 99.81 CI, n = 6) and small intestine being the tissue with the greatest intensity of infection (RQ mean = 46.91 ± 67.69 CI, n = 6) and the highest proportion of infection (0.83 (5/6), 0.37-0.99 CI). Out of all other tissues, the liver showed a proportionately high intensity of infection (RQ mean = 7.04 ± 5.97 CI, n = 11). Interestingly, lice showed both a high ratio of SADV to squirrel DNA (RQ mean = 78.24 ± 152.23 CI, n = 5) and where present on an infected squirrel the prevalence of SADV infection in lice was high (0.8 (4/5), 0.30-0.99 CI).

Despite the obvious advantages of multiplex PCR assays, they are still relatively underused compared with uniplex PCRs, possibly because of a persistent belief that multiplex assays require heavy investment into their setup and optimisation (Elnifro et al. 2000) . The methods used here, however, allowed development of assays that are reliable, analytically sensitive and specific and thus fulfil the required criteria for a diagnostic qPCR assay (Bustin et al. 2009 ). That we 

(4) (1) (11) (11) (11) (11) (11) (9) (11) (11) (11) (9) (11) (11) developed multiplex qPCR assays for two squirrel species indicates that developing multiplex qPCR assays for multiple pathogens in other wildlife species should be relatively straightforward. A clear benefit is that, since much of the optimisation and validation is carried out in multiplex, there is relatively little additional work required to develop assays that screen for more than one pathogen; moreover, multiplex reactions increase the amount of data gained from a single sample, and incorporating an endogenous IC into the design provides confidence in the reliability of the (negative) results and allows comparison of results across laboratories. Therefore, any disadvantage of additional initial investment into assay development is quickly outweighed by the greater quantity and quality of data produced. Overall, the new assays identified similar findings to the previously published methods. Our SQPV assays and the Atkin et al. (2010) SYBR® green assay both identified SQPVas a localised infection in grey squirrels, compared with the generalised, systemic infection in red squirrels. The agreement between available TEM data and our qPCR assays for SADV was moderate (k value = 0.39), but this level of agreement is nonetheless superior to that reported in studies using conventional PCR. Grey squirrel SADV results are reasonably comparable to previous studies reporting infection prevalence of spleen and blood samples as 54-57 and 0-7 % (Everest et al. 2014 ) in comparison to 33 and 50 % reported here. The difference in prevalence of SADV in blood samples may reflect the increased sensitivity of the qPCR assay developed, with the level of SADV in blood generally low, and thus potentially overlooked when screening with conventional PCR. However, differences in selection, geography and time of year may also have been responsible for or contributed to the data obtained. In red squirrels, SADV is believed to be an enteric infection although systemic effects are witnessed, with splenitis commonly reported (Martinez-Jimenez et al. 2011; Sainsbury et al. 2001) . This is supported by our data, with the gastrointestinal tract, liver, blood and spleen showing the highest intensities and prevalence of SADV infection.

Our assays offer several advantages over assays for SQPV (Atkin et al. 2010; Fiegna et al. 2016; McInnes et al. 2009 ) and SADV (Everest et al. 2009b) , namely increased specificity (using a hydrolysis probe), sensitivity (using qPCR) and a reduction in the occurrence of false negatives (e.g. insufficient DNA purification and PCR inhibition) via the use of a specific squirrel endogenous IC. In fact, the latter factor proved important in 7 out of 24 faecal samples analysed when screening samples, when, despite apparently adequate amounts of DNA, no amplification for the PGK assay (or either pathogen assay) was recorded. In the absence of an IC, these samples could have been classed as negative and highlight that a differing extraction process is required for faecal samples. (1) (2) (6) (6) (7) (6) (2) (1) (7) (6) (4) (4) (6) (4) (5) 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

(7) (7) (7) (7) (6) (7) (7) (7) (6) (6) (5) (7) (6) (7 Our qPCR assays provide a new, lower-resource and potentially higher-throughput sampling method. The use of an endogenous IC has allowed the validation of the use of swabs to detect the target pathogens. The level of a pathogen on a swab not only depends on the pathogen abundance at the site sampled but also on the amount of sample effort. However, it is reasonable to assume that this latter factor will also dictate the amount of reference DNA harvested. Hence, the use of an endogenous IC compensates for any variability in sample effort-a potential confounding factor when using swabs to collect samples. However, caution is required when comparing swabbed material with tissue samples. Relative quantification is the ratio of the target viral DNA (SQPV/SADV) to the reference squirrel DNA (PGK). Thus, if the sampling method harvests host cells poorly in comparison to viral particles, then an artificially high viral load may be indicated. This may, in part, explain why arm swabs yielded by far the highest RQ of SQPV in grey squirrels (Fig. 2) . Unsurprisingly, arm swabs show a poorer harvest of squirrel DNA in comparison to other sample types (Online Resource S10, Fig. S10.1 ). Yet, in terms of absolute quantities, arm swabs show a proportionally higher number of DNA copies of the SQPV target gene (Online Resource S10, Fig. S10.1) . Therefore, the high levels of SQPV in arm swabs appear genuine, a conclusion supported by the infection levels in skin sampled from the same site in red squirrels (see Figs. 2 and 3) .

Due to the apparent localised SQPV infection that grey squirrels displayed (Fig. 2 , see also (Atkin et al. 2010 ), diagnosis in this species can prove problematic particularly as no one single tissue can reliably be used to indicate grey squirrel SQPV infection status. While previous attempts to use swabs to diagnose a SQPV infection in grey squirrels failed to identify infected individuals (Collins et al. 2014) , swab samples provided several benefits in this study. Swabs allow multiple sites and a greater sampling area to be surveyed without concern for overloading the sample with host DNA. Thus, a single swab sampling the oral, eye and distal arm areas investigated would identify all infected individuals in this study and is recommended as the sampling method of choice in both squirrel species for SQPV detection alone (Table 2) . Adding a rectal swab (potentially combined with the cutaneous swab) and blood would make one confident in detecting the majority of SADV cases while also performing analysis for SQPV. It should be noted, however, that reliability of using swabs depends upon the use of the endogenous IC that indicates adequate harvesting of cells (via amplification of squirrel DNA).

Both assays have led to novel findings that re-enforce the importance of sensitive molecular diagnostic techniques in wildlife disease surveillance studies, where the use of gross lesions and/or less sensitive molecular methods are likely to underestimate pathogen prevalence. While all the red squirrel cases suspected of having SQPV based on gross post-mortem findings were positive for SQPV when assayed using qPCR, an additional case of SQPV was discovered that had gastrointestinal pathology recorded as the cause of death. Similarly, gastrointestinal lesions have been reported in a single SQPVinfected red squirrel in Northern Ireland (Collins et al. 2014 ). Other SQPV-infected red squirrels in this study yielded SQPV in the gastrointestinal tract, with an increase in RQ passing through the gastrointestinal tract potentially indicating replication within the intestine. The oropharynx is also reported to be a site of replication in red squirrels (Fiegna et al. 2016) .

Novel cases of SADV are reported in this study also. All three red squirrels that had died from causes other than skin lesions, gastrointestinal lesions or road causalities showed evidence of SADV infection. The two squirrels with severe pediculosis had SADV consistently identified in multiple tissue types, albeit at relatively low levels. The cause of death of these two squirrels was thought to be due to anaemia, It should be noted that the swab/blood samples appear to be superior to tissue samples in all instances apart from adenovirus in red squirrels when using the qPCR developed in this study secondary to parasitism (Duff et al. 2010; Larose et al. 2010; Simpson et al. 2013b ). However, haemorrhage has been reported in 70 % (7/10) of case studies of SADV infection (Martinez-Jimenez et al. 2011) . The prevalence of SADV in lice found on infected individuals was 80 % (4/5: 95 % CI, 30-99 %), which combined with the relatively high occurrence of viral DNA in blood (67 % (6/9); 95 % CI 31-91 %) may suggest a potential role of the parasite in pathogen transmission. Additionally, the red squirrel that had pneumonia also showed SADV DNA presence in all tissues analysed. The lung RQ value was the highest recorded in any infected individual (12.52), and, indeed, viral prevalence in lung tissue was relatively common in infected individuals (64 %, 7/11; 95 % CI, 32-88 %) (Fig. 3) .

In conclusion, the use of appropriate chemistries and software allowed straightforward development of two multiplex assays that allow fast processing of samples while simultaneously producing more reliable results (and at a reduced cost) than published assays. Increased sensitivity had provided new information about the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the target pathogens. While these new assays have specific benefits for epidemiological investigations into the diseases of squirrels, it is hoped this work will have a wider impact by stimulating development of further multiplex qPCRs that will maximise information collected from investigations into multi-pathogen systems, which are becoming increasingly important as knowledge of co-infection dynamics increases (Telfer et al. 2010) .

CD8+ T Cells Responding to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Protein Delivered by Vaccinia Virus MVA in Mice

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a novel infectious agent causing severe respiratory disease and death in humans, was first described in 2012. Antibodies directed against the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein are thought to play a major role in controlling MERS-CoV infection and in mediating vaccine-induced protective immunity. In contrast, relatively little is known about the role of T cell responses and the antigenic targets of MERS-CoV that are recognized by CD8+ T cells. In this study, the highly conserved MERS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein served as a target immunogen to elicit MERS-CoV-specific cellular immune responses. Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), a safety-tested strain of vaccinia virus for preclinical and clinical vaccine research, was used for generating MVA-MERS-N expressing recombinant N protein.

Overlapping peptides spanning the whole MERS-CoV N polypeptide were used to identify major histocompatibility complex class I/II-restricted T cell responses in BALB/c mice immunized with MVA-MERS-N. We have identified a H2-d restricted decamer peptide epitope in the MERS-N protein with CD8+ T cell antigenicity. The identification of this epitope, and the availability of the MVA-MERS-N candidate vaccine, will help to evaluate MERS-N-specific immune responses and the potential immune correlates of vaccine-mediated protection in the appropriate murine models of MERS-CoV infection.

At present, there is still relatively little known about the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV. The highest incidence of severe disease is observed in elderly and immunocompromised individuals [11] . Those at general risk for infections are health care workers and people in close contact with dromedary camels [12, 13] . These groups are therefore considered relevant target populations for prophylactic vaccination against MERS-CoV infection and prevention of MERS. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) have listed MERS as priority target for vaccine development [14] . However, so far, no candidate vaccines have proceeded beyond phase I/IIa clinical testing [15] . One of these candidate vaccines is based on Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), a safety-tested and replication-deficient vaccinia virus serving as an advanced viral vector platform for the development of new vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer (for review see [16] ). In that context, we still know relatively little about the correlates of vaccine induced protection against MERS-CoV. It is well-known that virus-neutralizing antibodies directed against the spike glycoprotein (S protein) correlate with protective immunity against coronavirus infections in general [17] [18] [19] [20] . Since the S protein is present on the cell surface, S protein is considered as the major antigen to induce virus neutralizing antibodies and as a key immunogen for the development of MERS-CoV candidate vaccines [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . However, based on current knowledge from the biology of β-coronaviruses, we hypothesize that also other viral proteins warrant consideration as immunogens and targets of virus-specific antibodies and T cells. Among those, the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) is produced at high levels in infected cells and has been proposed as useful candidate protein for clinical diagnosis [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . The coronavirus N proteins have been associated with multiple functions in the virus life cycle including the regulation of viral RNA synthesis, the packaging of the viral RNA in helical nucleocapsids, and in virion assembly through interaction with the viral M protein [31] [32] [33] [34] . Furthermore, several reports suggest that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) N protein functions as an immune evasion protein and an antagonist of the host interferon response [35] [36] [37] . Recently, the overexpression of MERS-CoV N in human A549 cells was found to be linked to an up-regulation of antiviral host gene expression including the synthesis of the inflammatory chemokine CXCL10 [38] . Despite this possible immune modulatory activity, SARS-CoV N-specific immune responses are reported to be long-lived and more broadly reactive when compared to SARS-CoV S-specific immunity [39] . Likewise, we were curious as to the suitability of the MERS-CoV N protein to serve as a vaccine antigen. The N protein is not present on the surface of MERS-CoV particles nor is it predicted to be expressed on the surface membrane of MVA infected cells. From this we hypothesized that the most relevant part of MERS-CoV N-specific immunity is based on CD8+ T cell responses relying on the processing and presentation of intracellular antigens. Currently, there is little information about MERS-CoV N-specific immune responses including the in vivo induction of N-specific cellular immunity.

In this study, we investigated the synthesis and delivery of the MERS-CoV N protein as a privileged antigen by a MVA vector virus. The recombinant MVA expressing a synthetic gene sequence of full-length MERS-CoV N (MVA-MERS-N) proved genetically stable and fully replication-competent in chicken embryo fibroblasts, an established cell substrate for MVA vaccine manufacturing. Upon in vitro infection, MVA-MERS-N produced high amounts of the heterologous protein that were detectable with MERS-CoV N-specific antibodies. Furthermore, MVA-MERS-N was tested as an experimental vaccine in BALB/c mice and elicited MERS-CoV N-specific interferon γ (IFN-γ)-producing CD8+ T cells. Using peptide library covering the whole MERS-CoV N polypeptide, we identified new H2-d restricted peptide epitopes of MERS-CoV N in BALB/c mice. This data will be highly relevant for further assessment of N antigen-specific immune responses in the well-established MERS-CoV-BALB/c mouse immunization/challenge model [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] .

The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a hitherto unknown β-coronavirus, emerged as a causative agent of a severe respiratory disease in humans in 2012. This new coronavirus was first isolated from the sputum of a patient suffering from severe pneumonia and renal failure [1] . To date, the MERS-CoV still causes disease and death in humans with a total of 2260 confirmed cases including 803 fatalities [2, 3] . Epidemiological data suggest that the MERS-CoV is endemic in Saudi Arabia, which accounts for the majority of primary community-acquired cases. Many of those primary cases are due to virus exposure through direct contact with dromedary camels, the primary animal reservoir of MERS-CoV. Alternatively, camel workers undergoing subclinical infections are suggested to mediate virus transmission to other susceptible individuals [4, 5] . Other outbreaks of MERS have been caused by nosocomial transmissions in health care settings [6] [7] [8] [9] . Most of the MERS-CoV infections occur within the Arabian Peninsula, i.e., Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates, however MERS cases have been reported in various other countries around the world [9, 10] .

Female BALB/c mice (6 to 10-week-old) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany). For experimental work, mice were housed in an isolated (ISO) cage unit (Tecniplast, Hohenpeißenberg, Germany) and had free access to food and water. All animal experiments were handled in compliance with the German regulations for animal experimentation (Animal Welfare Act, approved by the Government of Upper Bavaria, Munich, Germany).

Primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) were prepared from 10-day-old chicken embryos (SPF eggs, VALO, Cuxhaven, Germany) and maintained in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (MEM) (SIGMA-ALDRICH, Taufkirchen, Germany) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (SIGMA-ALDRICH, Taufkirchen, Germany), 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (SIGMA-ALDRICH, Taufkirchen, Germany), and 1% MEM non-essential amino acid solution (SIGMA-ALDRICH, Taufkirchen, Germany). Human HeLa (ATCC CCL-2) cells were maintained in MEM containing 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin. Human HaCat (CLS Cell Lines Service GmbH, Eppelheim, Germany) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (SIGMA-ALDRICH, Taufkirchen, Germany) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2% HEPES-solution (SIGMA-ALDRICH, Taufkirchen, Germany) and antibiotics as described above. All cells were maintained at 37 • C and 5% CO 2 atmosphere.

The cDNA encoding the entire amino acid (aa) sequence (413 aa) of the MERS-CoV N protein was in silico modified by introducing silent codon alterations to remove three termination signals (TTTTTNT) for vaccinia virus early transcription and two G/C nucleotide runs from the original MERS-CoV gene sequence (Human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012, GenBank accession no. JX869059). A cDNA fragment was generated by DNA synthesis (Invitrogen Life Technology, Regensburg, Germany) and cloned into the MVA transfer plasmid pIIIH5red [45] to place the MERS-CoV N gene sequence under the transcriptional control of the vaccinia virus early/late promoter PmH5 [46] resulting in the MVA vector plasmid pIIIH5red-MERS-N.

Recombinant MVA was generated using standard methodology as described previously [45] . Briefly, monolayers of nearly confluent CEF grown in six-well tissue culture plates (Sarstedt, Nürnbrecht, Germany) were infected with non-recombinant MVA (clonal isolate MVA F6) at 0.05 multiplicity of infection (MOI) and, 45 min after infection, CEF cells were transfected with plasmid pIIIH5red-MERS-N DNA using X-tremeGENE DNA Transfection Reagent Lipofectamine (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) as recommended by the manufacturer. At 48 h after infection, the cell cultures were harvested and recombinant MVA expressing the MERS-CoV N protein was clonally isolated by consecutive rounds of plaque purification in CEF by screening for transient co-expression of the red fluorescent marker protein mCherry.

Quality control experiments were performed using standard methodology [45] . Genetic identity and genetic stability of the recombinant virus were assessed via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the genomic viral DNA. Replicative capacities of the MVA vector virus was tested in multi-step growth experiments in CEF and human HaCat and HeLa cells.

To generate high titer vaccine preparations for preclinical studies, recombinant MVA was amplified in CEF, purified by ultracentrifugation through 36% sucrose cushions, resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0, and stored at −80 • C. The sucrose purified MVA-MERS-N vaccine preparations corresponded in total protein/total DNA content to the purity profile of a MVA candidate vaccine for human use.

Confluent cell monolayers of CEF or HaCat cells were infected at a MOI of 5 with recombinant MVA expressing the MERS-CoV N or S protein [23] . Non-infected (mock) or wild-type MVA-infected cells served as controls. Cell lysates were prepared at different time points after infection and stored at −80 • C. Total cell proteins were resolved by electrophoresis in a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-10% polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) and subsequently transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane via electroblotting. After 1 h blocking in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer containing 1% (w/v) non-fat dried milk and 0.1% (v/v) NP-40 detergent, the blots were incubated with monoclonal mouse anti-MERS-CoV Nucleocapsid antibody (Sino Biological, Beijing, China, 1:1000), monoclonal rabbit anti-MERS-CoV Spike Protein S1 Antibody (Sino Biological, 1:500), or polyclonal sera from MERS-CoV infected rabbits or cynomolgus macaques (kindly provided by Dr. Bart Haagmans, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, 1:1000) [23] as primary antibodies. After washing with 0.1% NP-40 in PBS, the blots were incubated with anti-mouse IgG (1:5000), or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:5000), or protein A (1:1000) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling Technology, Frankfurt am Main, Germany). After further washing, blots were developed using SuperSignal®West Dura Extended Duration substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Planegg, Gemany).

Groups of female BALB/c mice (n = 2 to 5) were immunized twice within a 21-day interval with 10 8 plaque-forming-units (PFU) of recombinant MVA-MERS-N or non-recombinant MVA (MVA) or PBS as mock vaccine. Vaccinations were given via the intramuscular (i.m.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) route using 25 µL (i.m.) or 200 µL (i.p.) volumes per inoculation. All mice were monitored daily for welfare and potential adverse events of immunization. At day 8 post prime-boost immunization, animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and spleens were taken for T cell analysis.

For T cell immune monitoring, we identified 101 individual synthetic peptides (assigned as 1 to 101) in silico spanning the entire MERS-CoV N protein sequence (Human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012, GenBank accession no. JX869059). This peptide library was designed to contain 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 aa. Eighty-four peptides could be synthesized (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and were organized into two-dimensional matrix peptide pools (V1 to V9 and H1 to H9) containing 9 or 10 peptides as described previously [47, 48] . For further T cell epitope mapping, the 11 aa sequence shared between peptide #89 and #90 was trimmed into 8-10-mer peptides, which were also obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific. All peptides were dissolved in PBS to a concentration of 2 mg/mL and stored at −20 • C until use.

Spleens were harvested on day 8 post prime-boost vaccination. Splenocytes were prepared by passing through a 70 µm strainer (Falcon®, A Corning Brand, Corning, USA) and incubating with Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer (SIGMA-ALDRICH, Taufkirchen, Germany). Cells were washed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (SIGMA-ALDRICH) containing 10% heat inactivated FBS and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin. Splenocytes were further processed by using the QuadroMACS Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) to separate CD8+ and CD4+ splenocytes with MACS Micro Beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany).

IFN-γ-producing T cells were measured using ELISPOT assays (Elispot kit for mouse IFN-γ, MABTECH, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 × 10 6 splenocytes were seeded in 96-well plates (Sarstedt, Nürnbrecht, Germany) and stimulated with peptide pools or individual peptides (2 µg peptide/mL RPMI 1640 medium) at 37 • C for 48 h. Non-stimulated cells and cells treated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (SIGMA-ALDRICH) and ionomycin (SIGMA-ALDRICH, Taufkirchen, Germany) or MVA F2L [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] peptide (F2L, SPGAAGYDL, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Planegg, Germany) [49] served as negative and positive controls, respectively. Automated ELISPOT plate reader software (A.EL.VIS Eli.Scan, A.EL.VIS ELISPOT Analysis Software, Hannover, Germany) was used to count and analyze spots.

Splenocytes were prepared as described above. Splenocytes were added to 96-well plates (1 × 10 6 cells/well) and stimulated for 6 h with MERS-CoV N-specific peptide (at 8 µg peptide/mL RPMI 1640 medium) in presence of the protein transport inhibitor Brefeldin A (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA; 5 µg/mL). Non-stimulated cells served as a background control and cells stimulated with 5 ng/mL PMA and 500 ng/mL ionomycin or with F2L peptide (8 µg/mL RPMI 1640 medium) were used as positive controls. After stimulation, cell surface antigens were stained using PE-conjugated anti-mouse CD3 (clone: 17A2, Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA), PE/Cy7-conjugated anti-mouse CD4 

Statistical analysis was performed by t-test using GraphPad Prism version 5 software (GraphPad software, San Diego CA, USA); P-values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

Recombinant virus MVA-MERS-N was formed in CEF that were infected with MVA and transfected with the MVA vector plasmid pIIIH5red-MERS-N ( Figure 1a ). The MVA DNA sequences in pIIIH5red-MERS-N (flank-1, flank-2) targeted the insertion of the N gene sequences into the site of deletion III within the MVA genome. The clonal isolation was facilitated by co-production of the red fluorescent reporter protein mCherry allowing for the convenient detection of MVA-MERS-N infected cells during plaque purification. The repetitive DNA sequence of flank-1 (FR) served to remove the marker gene mCherry from the genome of the final recombinant virus through initiating an intragenomic homologous recombination (marker gene deletion). After PCR analysis confirmed the presence of more than 95% MVA-MERS-N recombinant viruses in the cultures, we selected the final marker-free recombinant viruses by plaque purification and screening for plaques without mCherry fluorescence. To confirm genetic integrity and proper insertion of the heterologous N gene sequences within the MVA-MERS-N genome, we analyzed viral genomic DNA by PCR using specific oligonucleotide primers specific for MVA sequences adjacent to the deletion III insertion site ( Figure 1b In addition, the comparative Western blot analysis of cell lysates from MVA-MERS-N or MVA-MERS-S infected CEF with antigen-specific mouse monoclonal antibodies suggested the production of comparable amounts of both MERS-CoV candidate antigens (Figure 2b ). This observation is in line with the fact that the MVA-MERS-S candidate vector vaccine expresses the MERS-CoV S gene sequences using the identical PmH5 promoter system [23] . As shown in previous studies, we detected two MERS-CoV S-specific protein bands upon infection with MVA-MERS-S indicating the authentic proteolytic cleavage of the full-length S glycoprotein (~210 kDa) into an N-terminal (~120 kDa S1 domain) and a C-terminal (~85 kDa S2 domain; not detected) subunit [23, 50, 51] . Following this, we used the total protein lysates from MVA-MERS-N or MVA-MERS-S infected CEF to assess the recognition of the MERS-CoV N and S antigens by sera from experimentally MERS-CoV infected animals. The Western blot analysis of sera from an infected rabbit (Figure 2c ) or a cynomolgus monkey (Figure 2d ) revealed the presence of antibodies specific for the MERS-CoV N protein. The recognition of the MERS-CoV N protein was at least as prominent as the MERS-CoV S antigen, which was suggestive of the induction of substantial N-specific antibody responses after experimental MERS-CoV infections.

T cell responses against coronaviruses are known to be long lived and mostly target the more conserved CoV internal structural N protein. However, information on MERS-CoV N antigen-specific T cell specificities is still limited. Thus, we aimed first to identify N polypeptide-specific T cell epitopes in BALB/c mice immunized twice with recombinant virus MVA-MERS-N or non-recombinant MVA as a control via the intraperitoneal and intramuscular routes. Eight days after the final immunization, splenocytes were prepared and the purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were restimulated in vitro with overlapping peptides corresponding to the N protein. Overlapping peptides were pooled using a two-dimensional, pooled-peptide matrix system (Table S1 ) and screened by IFN-γ ELISPOT. The stimulation of splenoctyes from MVA-MERS-N immunized mice with the peptides from 16 out of the total 18 peptide pools did not result in the detection of IFN-γ producing T cells above background numbers obtained with splenocytes from mock or MVA-control vaccinated animals. Stimulation with the peptides from pools H8 (n = 10) and V8 (n = 10) as well as the use of the vaccinia virus positive peptide F2L [49] (data not shown) showed elevated numbers of IFN-γ spot forming cells (SFC) in CD8+ T cell cultures (Figure 3a,b) . MVA-MERS-N immunizations given by i.p. and i.m. routes resulted in comparable T cell stimulatory capacities of overlapping N-specific peptides from pools V8 and H8. In contrast, peptides from other pools showed no or only minor stimulatory activities, as exemplified for peptides in pools V4 and V6. 

Following this, the peptides within the V8 and H8 peptide pools were used to elucidate in more detail the T cell epitope specificities. We subdivided the peptides from H8 and V8 in four new pools each containing five peptides (H8.1, H8.2, V8.1, V8.2). In addition, we separately tested the two 15mer peptides #89 and #90, which were shared between pools H8 and V8. We again vaccinated BALB/c mice with MVA-MERS-N using i.p. or i.m. inoculations in a prime-boost regime. Splenocytes were prepared at day eight after the last vaccination and purified CD8+ T cells were restimulated with subpools V8.1., V8.2., H8.1, and H8.2 (Figure 4a ). Stimulation with peptides from pools V8.1 or H8.1 activated only minor levels of IFN-γ producing cells with mean levels about 23 SFC/10 6 splenocytes. Yet, the stimulation with subpools V8.2 and H8.2 revealed clearly higher numbers of activated T cells with 83-176 IFN-γ SFC/10 6 splenocytes. Comparable numbers of IFN-γ producing cells were again induced by i.p. or i.m. immunization. Of note, the stimulations with the 15-mer peptides #89 (N353-367 = QNIDAYKTFPKKEKK) or #90 (N357-371 = AYKTFPKKEKKQKAP) alone resulted in detection of substantial quantities of IFN-γ producing cells (mean levels about 71-107 SFC/10 6 splenocytes) in mice that had been vaccinated with MVA-MERS-N by both immunization routes (Figure 4b ). CD8+ T cells purified from mice receiving non-recombinant MVA or mock vaccine (PBS) did not produce IFN-γ following stimulation with peptides from subpools V8.1-H8.2 and with peptides #89 and #90. When checking for the specific peptides contained within the subpools, we observed that the strongly stimulatory peptides #89 and #90 were part of the subpools V8.2 and H8.2, whereas these peptides were absent in V8.1 and H8.1. This data suggested that the overlapping 15-mer peptides #89 and #90 contained a valuable antigen epitope for the activation of MERS-CoV N-specific CD8+ T cell responses. 

Following this, the peptides within the V8 and H8 peptide pools were used to elucidate in more detail the T cell epitope specificities.

This data suggested that the overlapping 15-mer peptides #89 and #90 contained a valuable antigen epitope for the activation of MERS-CoV N-specific CD8+ T cell responses. 

To map more precisely this specific epitope within the MERS-CoV N protein, we concentrated on the overlapping 11-mer peptide shared between peptides #89 and #90 and obtained nine 8-10-mer peptides (Table 1) . Using these peptides for the stimulation of splenoctyes from MVA-MERS-N vaccinated mice, we obtained the highest numbers of IFN-γ producing T cells with peptide 10.2 (mean levels of 94 to 97 SFC/10 6 splenocytes), while the other peptides (10.1, 9.1, 9. 

The availability of appropriate MERS-CoV-specific immune monitoring tools is a prerequisite for the successful development of vaccines and therapeutic approaches. The development of these tools is hampered by the fact that we still know little about the relevant viral antigens and the overall pathogenesis of the MERS-CoV infection. Recent studies describe a number of cases with asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection in humans and raise questions as to which factors influence the clinical manifestation of MERS [52, 53] . Since asymptomatic or mild clinical manifestations of MERS-CoV infection are often associated with low levels of seropositivity, the analysis of MERS-CoV-specific cellular immune responses may facilitate further insight into the immune correlates of disease prevention. Moreover, in order to characterize the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection, it will be indispensable to monitor the role of virus-specific T cells in animal models of MERS and to precisely identify the antigen specificities of these T cell responses.

In the present study, we identified a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype H2-d restricted peptide epitope in the MERS-CoV N protein by stimulating T cells from MVA-MERS-N vaccinated BALB/c mice with a 2-D matrix pool of overlapping peptides. These mice have already been used in various preclinical studies to establish the MERS-CoV S protein as an important vaccine antigen for induction of virus neutralizing antibodies [23, [40] [41] [42] 54] . Moreover, BALB/c mice transduced with the human cell surface receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4) using an adenovirus vector are susceptible to productive MERS-CoV lung infection, which allows for the testing of the protective efficacy of MERS-CoV-specific immunization using the MERS-CoV S protein [24, 40, 41, 43, 44] . Here, we wished to specifically assess the suitability of an MVA-delivered MERS-CoV N antigen for the activation of cellular immune responses in mice. In general, the N protein is a well conserved internal protein and the major structural component incorporating the viral RNA within the viral nucleocapsid [55] . In previous studies, the SARS-CoV N protein has also been used as candidate antigen for vaccine development [56] , and an experimental DNA vaccine efficiently induced SARS-CoV N-specific cellular immunity [57, 58] . In line with this data, recent studies in MERS patients demonstrated that both antibody and T cell responses are associated with recovery from MERS-CoV infection [59] .

The recombinant virus MVA-MERS-N produced stable amounts of MERS-CoV N antigen upon in vitro infection of human cells indicating the unimpaired expression of the target gene at the level of viral late transcription using the synthetic vaccinia virus-specific promoter PmH5 [46] . Moreover, the MERS-CoV N antigen produced in MVA-MERS-N infected cells was strongly recognized by antibodies from experimentally infected laboratory animals suggesting that N-specific immune responses were potently activated upon MERS-CoV infection. It seems noteworthy that MERS-CoV productively replicates in rabbits, but viral loads are low and the animals develop no overt disease symptoms. However, Haagmans et al. found infectious virus in the lung tissues of the rabbits and revealed the presence of the MERS-CoV N antigen in bronchiolar epithelial cells and in the epithelial cells of the nose [60] . The localization of N in these respiratory epithelial cells may result in an efficient recognition by innate and also adaptive immune cells similar to those described for other viruses inducing robust protective immunity [61] . This might be a possible explanation for efficient activation of MERS-CoV N-specific antibodies despite a barely productive MERS-CoV infection. Similar outcomes of infection were observed upon MERS-CoV infection in cynomolgus macaques and other relevant non-human primate models [62, 63] . Thus, the induction of N-specific immune responses in these animals emphasizes the potential usefulness of the MERS-CoV N protein to serve as vaccine antigen.

Nevertheless, the immunogenicity of N requires further characterization in preclinical models for MERS-CoV infection. In addition to the induction of MERS-CoV-specific antibodies, the MERS-CoV N protein holds promise to efficiently activate virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses. For more detailed studies characterizing the possible role of these T cell specificities in MERS-CoV-associated immunity or pathogenesis it is highly relevant to determine the N peptide epitopes allowing for the appropriate MHC-restricted antigen presentation and the activation of virus-specific T cells. In this study, we identified a new H2-d restricted CD8+ T cell epitope in the MERS-CoV N protein using a 2-D matrix and pools of 84 overlapping 15-mer N peptides. First, we have identified two MERS-CoV N derived peptides (N 353-367 = QNIDAYKTFPKKEKK and N 357-371 = AYKTFPKKEKKQKAP) and further mapped these 15-mer peptides to the minimal aa sequence of N 358-367 = YKTFPKKEKK representing a decamer peptide epitope ( Figure S1 ) [64] . Analysis of MERS-CoV sequences reveals that N 358-367 is conserved among different strains of MERS-CoV (Table S2 ) [65] . The availability of such an epitope may allow for more detailed experimental monitoring of cellular immune responses induced by a MVA based candidate vaccine against MERS-CoV in the mouse model and potentially also in other preclinical models. Of note, the H2-d restricted CD8+ T cell epitope enables characterization of T cell responses in BALB/c mice that serve as a well-established MERS-CoV infection model following adenovirus vector mediated transduction with hDPP4 [24, 40, 41, 43, 44] . A particular feature of MERS in humans, as observed upon the investigation of cluster outbreaks in hospitals, is the lack of detectable MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in patients with confirmed disease [66, 67] . This observation is attributed to the emergence of specific virus mutants evading the neutralizing antibody response, as already described for SARS-CoV [68, 69] . Thus, future use of a T cell-specific immune monitoring might contribute to a more detailed understanding of MERS pathogenesis. Here, studies on the function of MERS-CoV-specific CD8+ T cells in this BALB/c mouse MERS-CoV lung infection model will be helpful to better estimate the role of cellular immunity in vaccine mediated protection in MERS-CoV infection.

Finally, the MVA-MERS-N vector virus generated for this study proved to be a stable recombinant virus that can be readily amplified to obtain vaccine preparations technically fulfilling all requirements for further preclinical or even clinical development. Future work with MVA-MERS-N candidate vaccines should help to elucidate the potential protective capacity of N-specific immune responses in MERS-CoV infections models and contribute to our better understanding of MERS vaccine-induced protection.

Inhibitors of Deubiquitinating Enzymes Block HIV-1 Replication and Augment the Presentation of Gag-Derived MHC-I Epitopes

In recent years it has been well established that two major constituent parts of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS)-the proteasome holoenzymes and a number of ubiquitin ligases-play a crucial role, not only in virus replication but also in the regulation of the immunogenicity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). However, the role in HIV-1 replication of the third major component, the deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), has remained largely unknown. In this study, we show that the DUB-inhibitors (DIs) P22077 and PR-619, specific for the DUBs USP7 and USP47, impair Gag processing and thereby reduce the infectivity of released virions without affecting viral protease activity. Furthermore, the replication capacity of X4-and R5-tropic HIV-1 NL4-3 in human lymphatic tissue is decreased upon treatment with these inhibitors without affecting cell viability. Most strikingly, combinatory treatment with DIs and proteasome inhibitors synergistically blocks virus replication at concentrations where mono-treatment was ineffective, indicating that DIs can boost the therapeutic effect of proteasome inhibitors. In addition, P22077 and PR-619 increase the polyubiquitination of Gag and thus its entry into the UPS and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I pathway. In summary, our data point towards a model in which specific inhibitors of DUBs not only interfere with virus spread but also increase the immune recognition of HIV-1 expressing cells.

The homeostasis of eukaryotic cells is maintained by a well-tuned balance between biosynthesis and degradation of proteins. The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) constitutes the main non-lysosomal intracellular protein degradation pathway that comprises three major components: the proteasome holoenzymes, a number of ubiquitin ligases and a broad variety of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). Ubiquitin (Ub) is attached to target proteins by the cascade-like catalytic action of E1, E2 and E3 enzymes. The ubiquitin molecule is activated by an E1 ligase, followed by the transfer to one of numerous conjugating enzymes, and finally an E3 ligase catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin onto the ε-amino group of a Lysine residue within the target protein (for review see [1] ). Thereby, the

HeLa SS6, HeLa TZM-bl, and HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) containing 10% (v/v) inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. HeLa-K b cells were cultivated in DMEM with additional 1 mg/mL geneticin. All cell culture media and reagents were purchased from Gibco (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). CEMx174 cells were cultured in RPMI Media 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) inactivated FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. Confluent monolayers of HeLa cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four hours post transfection cells were lysed in radio immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1% NP-40, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)) containing protease inhibitor cocktail Complete (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF).

The NL4-3 [42] derived expression construct pNLenv1 [43] , the R5-tropic derivative carrying the 005pf135 V3 loop region in Env [44] and the p∆R construct [30] , harboring a mutational inactivation of the viral protease (PR − ) [32] , have been previously described. The expression plasmids encoding a codon optimized synthetic Gag polyprotein (syngag), which had developed from the HIV-1 HX10 isolate [45] , harboring wt p6 or mutants thereof, in which the two amino acid motifs PTAP have been exchanged to AIVA, have been described elsewhere [26, 46, 47] . The construct containing the ovalbumin-derived model epitope SIINFEKL (SL) in its p2 spacer region, syngag-SL, has been previously described [48, 49] . The plasmid for expression of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub) was kindly provided by H.-G. Kräusslich and has been described elsewhere [30] .

Virus containing cell culture supernatant was harvested 48 h after transfection of HEK293T cells with proviral expression constructs and passed through a 0.45 µm pore-size filter. Virus was pelleted

The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg (Project identification code: 3761).

HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pNLenv1 wt. After overnight cultivation at 37 • C the cell culture supernatant was harvested and VLPs released into the supernatant were pelleted through 20% (w/v) sucrose by centrifugation (20,000× g, 4 • C, 90 min), washed with ice cold PBS, centrifuged (20,000× g, 4 • C, 90 min), lysed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) sample buffer containing 2% SDS, and boiled for 5 min. The cells were detached and washed twice in ice cold PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer, supplemented with 1 mM PMSF, 5 mM NEM, and protease inhibitor cocktail Complete (Roche). The samples were analyzed by western blotting. Protein bands were quantified using AIDA [54] .

HeLa cells were transiently transfected with p∆R PR - [32] . After overnight cultivation at 37 • C, released VLPs were harvested as described above and lysed in protease cleavage buffer (50 mM MES pH 6.5, 1 M NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 adapted from [55] ). In vitro processing was performed using 2.56 µM Recombinant HIV1 Protease Protein (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 9 h at 37 • C. Processing was terminated by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling.

Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE [56] and subsequently transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). Membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody (Ab). Gag was detected by a rabbit Ab recognizing CA (Seramun, Heidesee, Germany). The anti-β-actin antibody was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The anti-mouse and anti-rabbit Viruses 2017, 9, 222 5 of 22 secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were obtained from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). HA-tagged ubiquitin was visualized using an HA-reactive monoclonal antibody (mAb) directly conjugated to HRP (Roche).

HeLa cells were lysed with RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail, NEM, and PMSF. Lysates were adjusted to 1% SDS (w/v) and incubated at 95 • C for 10 min, subsequently diluted to 0.1% SDS and were then cleared by centrifugation at 20,000× g for 10 min. Gag content was recovered by immunoprecipitation with antibodies derived from HIV-1 patient sera pre-bound to GammaBind Plus Sepharose (GE Healthcare). For detection of ubiquitinated Gag proteins directly by western blotting, RIPA lysis buffer was supplemented with 20 µM lactacystin and 20 µM carbobenzoxyl-leucine-leucine-leucinal.

For detection of H2-K b -bound SL-epitope, cells were stained with the allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated 25D1.16 mAb (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) diluted 1:100 in fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (5% (v/v) FCS, 0.02% (v/v) NaN 3 in PBS). For intracellular Gag staining, cells were permeabilized using Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA). Gag was detected by staining with a FITC-labeled anti-CA mAb (KC57; Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) diluted 1:100 in Perm/Wash buffer (BD Bioscience). For detection of total H2-K b molecules, cells were incubated with hybridoma cell culture supernatant containing the mAb B8-24-3 [57] , followed by staining with secondary Alexa 647-conjugated anti-mouse Ab (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur using CellQuest software (BD Bioscience). Data were analyzed by using the FACS Express V3 software (De Novo Software).

HeLa TZM-bl indicator cells were seeded in 96-well plates in duplicates (4000 cells/well) and infected the next day with 1 ng vesicular stomatitis virus-glycoprotein (VSV-G)-pseudotyped virions standardized for p24 content by ELISA (Aalto Bio Reagents). After overnight incubation, fresh medium was added. 48 h later, cells were washed with PBS and infection was detected using the Gal-Screen chemiluminescent reporter gene assay system (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA). β-Galactosidase activity was quantified as relative light units per second using a Synergy HT microplate reader and Gen5 Data Analysis Software (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).

For infection of HLA cultures, 2 × 10 6 cells were incubated overnight with virus preparations equivalent to 1 ng of p24, and cell culture supernatant was collected every second or third day post infection. Where indicated, the cells were treated with different concentrations of the DIs P22077 or PR-619 as part of the medium change on the delineated days post infection (dpi).

Virus replication was assessed by quantification of the virus-associated reverse transcriptase activity by [ 32 P]-thymidine triphosphate (TTP) incorporation, using an oligo(dT)-poly(A) template as described elsewhere [58] . To determine the replication capacity of HIV-1 following infection with HIV-1 NL4-3 or the field isolate 4lig7, the respective replication profiles were depicted as diagram (y-axis: RT activity; x-axis: dpi). To calculate the arithmetic mean of the values obtained from experiments performed in HLAC from different donors the area under the curve of each replication profile was calculated and defined as the corresponding replication capacity. In every experiment the replication capacity of the untreated wt was set to 100% and compared with the inhibitor treated samples.

Viability of infected and treated cells was assessed by the water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST)-1 assay (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

3.1. The DUB-Inhibitors P22077 and PR-619 Impair Gag Processing without Affecting Protease Activity

In order to investigate of whether DUB activities play any role in late steps of HIV-1 replication, we analyzed VLP release and Gag processing after DI treatment. For this purpose HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the HIV-1 expression plasmid pNLenv1 [43] which directs efficient expression of all HIV-1 proteins except the Env glycoproteins. Cells were treated with the following DIs: P22077, which specifically inhibits the DUBs USP7 and USP47 [59] , the DI P5091, which only inhibits USP7 [60] , and the DI PR-619, that, in addition to USP7 and USP47, inhibits the DUBs Josephin domain containing 2 (JOSD2), deneddylase 1 (DEN1), UCH-L3, UCH-L5, USP2, 4, 5, 8, 15, 20, and 28 [59] . Western blot analyses of whole cell lysates and VLP fractions, using Gag-specific antibodies, revealed that treatment with P22077 or PR-619 led to an overall defect in Gag processing with prominent accumulation of the Pr55 Gag precursor protein as well as the processing intermediates p25 (CA-SP1), p41 (MA-CA-NC) and p39 (MA-CA) in the VLP fractions ( Figure 1A ). In contrast, addition of the DI P5091, which is selective for USP7, had no influence on Gag processing ( Figure 1B ). Densitometric analyses of the western blot data illustrate that the efficacy of Gag processing was reduced by about 2-fold in cells treated with P22077 or PR-619, whereas cells treated with the DI P5091 had wt level ( Figure 1C ), indicating that certain DUB activities regulate late steps of HIV replication. Although the DI P22077 and PR-619 clearly reduced Gag processing, none of the inhibitors had any influence on the efficiency of VLP release ( Figure 1D ).

As virus release remained unaffected, one explanation for the defect in Gag processing would be direct inhibition of the HIV-1 PR by the DIs PR-619 or P22077. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the effect of these DIs on the in vitro processing of HIV-1 Gag. Purified VLPs derived from the p∆R PR − construct [32] , encoding a protease deficient HIV-1 mutant virus, were lysed and incubated with 2.56 µM of the HIV-1 PR. No effect on the protease activity was observed for PR-619 or P22077 ( In contrast, addition of the DI P5091, which is selective for USP7, had no influence on Gag processing ( Figure 1B ). Densitometric analyses of the western blot data illustrate that the efficacy of Gag processing was reduced by about 2-fold in cells treated with P22077 or PR-619, whereas cells treated with the DI P5091 had wt level ( Figure 1C ), indicating that certain DUB activities regulate late steps of HIV replication. Although the DI P22077 and PR-619 clearly reduced Gag processing, none of the inhibitors had any influence on the efficiency of VLP release ( Figure 1D ). 

As treatment with P22077 or PR-619 led to reduced Gag processing, which should also reduce virus infectivity [61] , we next determined the impact of these DIs on the infectivity of released HIV-1 virus particles. To perform single round infections, we generated vesicular stomatitis virus --glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotyped pNLenv1 VLPs by transfecting HEK293T cells that were either 

As treatment with P22077 or PR-619 led to reduced Gag processing, which should also reduce virus infectivity [61] , we next determined the impact of these DIs on the infectivity of released HIV-1 virus particles. To perform single round infections, we generated vesicular stomatitis virus-glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotyped pNLenv1 VLPs by transfecting HEK293T cells that were either incubated with the DIs P22077 or PR-619, or left untreated. VLPs were isolated and subsequently used for single round infections in TZM-bl cells, and infectivity was ascertained by measuring β-galactosidase activity. Treatment with 15 µM or 20 µM P22077 reduced the infectivity of released VLPs up to 2-fold, and 5-fold, respectively ( Figure 3) . Similarly, the infectivity of VLPs, generated under treatment with 7 µM or 14 µM PR-619, was about 4-or even 10-fold diminished. Thus, VLPs produced under DUB inhibition exhibit loss of specific infectivity, most likely due to impaired Gag processing. 

To further analyze the potential antiretroviral activity of the DIs PR-619 and P22077, HLAC [62] , prepared from human tonsil tissue, were infected with HIV-1NL4-3. HLA cultures reflect the natural cell population of a lymphoid tissue and support productive HIV-1 replication independently of coreceptor tropism and without exogenous stimulation [52, 53] . The cells were infected with either T-cell (X4)-or macrophage (R5)-tropic HIV-1NL4-3 standardized for equal amounts of p24. Following permanent (up to 15 days post infection) or structured treatment (only day 1 and 3 post infection) with increasing concentrations of the DIs PR-619 or P22077, cell culture supernatants were collected on the indicated days post infection (dpi) and analyzed for release of virus particles by measuring the virus associated reverse transcriptase (RT) activity ( Figure 4A ).

Permanent treatment with the DIs PR-619 and P22077 interfered with virus replication in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in a complete loss of replication capacity at 10 μM of PR-619 or 15 μM of P22077 ( Figure 4C ,E). Almost the same result was observed following structured treatment, indicating a severe block in spread of infection caused by DI treatment ( Figure 4B ,D). No delay in peak virus replication was observed indicating the inhibitory effect of PR-619 and P22077 must set in immediately after application of the drugs. 

To further analyze the potential antiretroviral activity of the DIs PR-619 and P22077, HLAC [62] , prepared from human tonsil tissue, were infected with HIV-1 NL4-3 . HLA cultures reflect the natural cell population of a lymphoid tissue and support productive HIV-1 replication independently of coreceptor tropism and without exogenous stimulation [52, 53] . Since the replication of HIV-1 in HLAC generally exhibits donor-dependent differences, the area under the curve (AUC), representing the replication capacity in each HLA culture, was determined to enable the comparison of results obtained in HLAC from different donors ( Figure  5A ,B,D,E,G,H,J,K). Evaluation of the replication profiles of untreated wt compared to structured treatment with PR-619 or P22077 in HLAC revealed a concentration-dependent reduction of the replication capacity in all settings, irrespective of treatment scheme or tropism of HIV-1 ( Figure  5A ,B,G,H). An even more dramatic effect on X4-and R5-tropic virus replication was observed under permanent treatment with 5 μM PR-619 ( Figure 5D ,E) or 7.5 μM P22077 ( Figure 5J ,K). Irrespective of treatment schemes, the highest inhibitor concentrations of 10 μM PR-619 or 15 μM P22077 almost completely blocked the replication capacity of X4-and R5-tropic viruses. In contrast, the USP7-specific DI P5091, which had no impact on Gag processing efficiency, did not reduce virus replication (data not shown). To exclude unspecific effects of P22077 and PR-619 on cell viability, water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST)-1 assays were performed. Structured treatment with inhibitor concentrations, which completely suppressed HIV-1 virus replication, had no impact on cell viability ( Figure 5C ,I). Permanent treatment merely led to a slight, stepwise decline in cell viability down to about 80% at the highest concentration of PR-619 or P22077 ( Figure 5F ,L). Altogether, these results demonstrate that DIs induce a concentration-dependent decline in replication capacity of HIV-1NL4-3, independently of tropism and treatment scheme, and without showing any toxic effects. Since the replication of HIV-1 in HLAC generally exhibits donor-dependent differences, the area under the curve (AUC), representing the replication capacity in each HLA culture, was determined to enable the comparison of results obtained in HLAC from different donors ( Figure 5A ,B,D,E,G,H,J,K). Evaluation of the replication profiles of untreated wt compared to structured treatment with PR-619 or P22077 in HLAC revealed a concentration-dependent reduction of the replication capacity in all settings, irrespective of treatment scheme or tropism of HIV-1 (Figure 5A ,B,G,H). An even more dramatic effect on X4-and R5-tropic virus replication was observed under permanent treatment with 5 µM PR-619 ( Figure 5D ,E) or 7.5 µM P22077 ( Figure 5J,K) . Irrespective of treatment schemes, the highest inhibitor concentrations of 10 µM PR-619 or 15 µM P22077 almost completely blocked the replication capacity of X4-and R5-tropic viruses.

Permanent treatment merely led to a slight, stepwise decline in cell viability down to about 80% at the highest concentration of PR-619 or P22077 ( Figure 5F ,L). Altogether, these results demonstrate that DIs induce a concentration-dependent decline in replication capacity of HIV-1 NL4-3 , independently of tropism and treatment scheme, and without showing any toxic effects. 

[µM] -2. 5 Having demonstrated the anti-retroviral effect of the DIs PR-619 and P22077 for the T cell culture adapted molecular HIV-1 clone NL4-3, we examined whether those DIs also affect HIV-1 field isolates, like the multidrug resistant field isolate HIV-1 4lig7 . This isolate exhibits several drug resistance mutations within the RT and the PR open reading frame, causing resistance to all nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and most PR inhibitors [63] (Figure 6E ). To analyze the influence of DIs on the replication capacity of HIV-1 4lig7 , HLAC were infected with HIV-1 4lig7 virus preparations standardized for p24, and structured or permanent treatment with indicated amounts of PR-619 and P22077 was applied ( Figure 6A-D) . Measuring the virus associated RT activity showed that both DIs induced the same dose-dependent reduction of replication capacity for the multidrug resistant HIV-1 field isolate, as it was observed for HIV-1 NL4-3 . Having demonstrated the anti-retroviral effect of the DIs PR-619 and P22077 for the T cell culture adapted molecular HIV-1 clone NL4-3, we examined whether those DIs also affect HIV-1 field isolates, like the multidrug resistant field isolate HIV-14lig7. This isolate exhibits several drug resistance mutations within the RT and the PR open reading frame, causing resistance to all nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and most PR inhibitors [63] (Figure 6E ). To analyze the influence of DIs on the replication capacity of HIV-14lig7, HLAC were infected with HIV-14lig7 virus preparations standardized for p24, and structured or permanent treatment with indicated amounts of PR-619 and P22077 was applied ( Figure 6A-D) . Measuring the virus associated RT activity showed that both DIs induced the same dose-dependent reduction of replication capacity for the multidrug resistant HIV-1 field isolate, as it was observed for HIV-1NL4-3. Previously, it was demonstrated that proteasome inhibitors interfere with HIV-1 Gag processing and virus infectivity [38] . Moreover, it has been shown that proteasome inhibitors block the replication capacity of HIV-1 in cell culture [64] . Both inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors and DIs, induce the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, albeit by different mode of action. Thus, it was intriguing to investigate whether proteasome inhibitors in combination with DIs would generate synergistic effects on HIV-1 replication capacity. Therefore, HLAC were infected with HIV-1NL4-3 and replication studies were performed as described above (see Figure 4 ). Following permanent treatment with increasing amounts of PR-619 or P22077 together with 0.6 nM of the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib, specific for the constitutive proteasome [65] , significant reduction in replication capacity was observed ( Figure 7A,C) . Similar results were obtained after permanent treatment with increasing amounts of PR-619 or P22077 and 10 nM PR-957, which is a specific inhibitor of the immunoproteasome [66] (Figure 7E,G) . In contrast, individual treatment with each DI or proteasome inhibitor alone had no influence on virus replication at this concentration range. Cell viability was assessed by WST-1 assay showing that all applied substances had no impact on cell viability in any individual or combinatory treatment scheme ( Figure 7B,D,F,H) . Together, these results reveal a synergistic antiretroviral activity of inhibitors that act on both components of the UPS, proteasomes and DUBs. Previously, it was demonstrated that proteasome inhibitors interfere with HIV-1 Gag processing and virus infectivity [38] . Moreover, it has been shown that proteasome inhibitors block the replication capacity of HIV-1 in cell culture [64] .

In contrast, individual treatment with each DI or proteasome inhibitor alone had no influence on virus replication at this concentration range. Cell viability was assessed by WST-1 assay showing that all applied substances had no impact on cell viability in any individual or combinatory treatment scheme ( Figure 7B,D,F,H) . Together, these results reveal a synergistic antiretroviral activity of inhibitors that act on both components of the UPS, proteasomes and DUBs. 

By blocking the deubiquitination of Gag, the DIs P22077 and PR-619 should also increase steady state levels of poly-ubiquitinated Gag and thus its entry into the UPS. To address this issue, HeLa cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub) and syngag expression plasmids, and treated for 12 h with indicated concentrations of DIs. The ∆PTAP mutant, which was shown to display elevated levels of ubiquitinated Gag, was assessed in parallel [25, 30] . To avoid rapid proteasomal degradation of polyubiquitinated Gag species following DI treatment, cells were incubated with the proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and Lactacystin (LC) 4 h prior to cell lysis. After immunoprecipitation with Gag-specific antibodies, western blot analyses were performed and ubiquitinated Gag species were detected by anti-HA staining (Figure 8 ). Following co-expression of syngag wt and HA-Ub, a faint pattern of high molecular weight species was observed, which most likely represents polyubiquitinated Gag. Upon treatment with 14 µM PR-619 or 20 µM P22077, the intensity of the HA-Ub-signal was clearly increased and exceeded even the ubiquitination-levels of the ∆PTAP mutant. Similar amounts of precipitated Gag were confirmed by anti-CA staining. Thus, treatment with P22077 or PR-619 enhances polyubiquitination of Gag.

Similar amounts of precipitated Gag were confirmed by anti-CA staining. Thus, treatment with P22077 or PR-619 enhances polyubiquitination of Gag. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that the measurement of the presentation of Gag-derived epitopes on MHC-I molecules at the cell surface represents a highly sensitive and reliable approach to follow the entry of Gag into the UPS [26, 32, 48, 67] . To investigate whether DI treatment leads to enhanced antigen presentation, we measured the presentation of Gag-derived epitopes on MHC-I molecules at the cell surface as described previously [26, 32, 33, 48] . After transfection of the syngag-SL expression plasmid into HeLa cells, which stably express the murine MHC-I allotype H2-K b (referred to as HeLa-K b cells) [68] , flow cytometry analyses revealed a concentration-dependent increase in SL presentation after treatment with P22077 or PR-619 ( Figure  9A ). Addition of 10 μM P22077 or 7 μM PR-619 led to a 3-fold increase in SL presentation, while addition of 14 μM PR-619 caused an even 10-fold increase in the SL presentation. To exclude that the enhanced antigen presentation was due to elevated levels of H2-K b complexes at the cell surface resulting from DI treatment, the amount of total H2-K b was quantified, showing similar amounts of H2-K b molecules at the cell surface after treatment with P22077 and PR-619 compared to untreated control ( Figure 9B ). In our previous studies, we demonstrated that the measurement of the presentation of Gag-derived epitopes on MHC-I molecules at the cell surface represents a highly sensitive and reliable approach to follow the entry of Gag into the UPS [26, 32, 48, 67] .

Taken together, these results indicate that DIs, especially those targeting USP7 and USP47, not only inhibit HIV-1 replication but also lead to an enhanced polyubiquitination and thus entry of Gag into the MHC-I pathway.

It is commonly accepted that ubiquitin plays an important role in retrovirus budding, but its mode of function, particularly in HIV-1 late replication steps, has been controversially discussed [38, 69, 70] . Although some studies suggest that the monoubiquitination of Gag contributes to efficient virus particle release via the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) [31, 71, 72] more recent studies indicate that ubiquitination of Gag can occur independently of the ESCRT-complex and might be dispensable to drive viral particle release [26, 32, 34, 73, 74] . Moreover, it was demonstrated that the mutation of the PTAP-motif within p6 causes enhanced ubiquitination of Gag due to its prolonged membrane association [25, 26] . This process has been ascribed to the interaction of Gag with a complex consisting of CCDC8, Obsl1, and the E3 ligase Cul7 at the plasma membrane [34] . In addition, it has been shown very recently that the highly conserved S40 and the glutamic acids within p6 can regulate the association of Gag with membranes and thus its entry into the UPS and MHC-I pathway [32, 33] . Mutation of these motifs leads to a prolonged membrane association of Gag and thus an enhanced entry into the UPS. These observations led us to speculate that in the wt situation certain DUBs interact with p6 or other domains of Gag, remove polyubiquitin chains, and thereby regulate its entry into the UPS. In this study, we could show that DIs, especially those inhibiting USP7 and USP47, enhance the entry of Gag into the UPS and thus into the MHC-I pathway, indicating that specific DUBs play an important role in the regulation of Gag ubiquitination. Moreover, Gag processing was impaired upon DI treatment, resulting in a reduced infectivity and replication capacity of HIV-1, which can be boosted by combinatory treatment with proteasome inhibitors.

Until now, the role of the vast variety of DUBs in the replication cycle of viruses is poorly understood, although there is an increasing evidence that besides HIV also other virus families evolved strategies to hijack the UPS in order to accomplish their own replication successfully. For Taken together, these results indicate that DIs, especially those targeting USP7 and USP47, not only inhibit HIV-1 replication but also lead to an enhanced polyubiquitination and thus entry of Gag into the MHC-I pathway.

Until now, the role of the vast variety of DUBs in the replication cycle of viruses is poorly understood, although there is an increasing evidence that besides HIV also other virus families evolved strategies to hijack the UPS in order to accomplish their own replication successfully. For instance, it could be shown that Ub-ligases as well as the 26S proteasome play an important role in various steps of virus replication, e.g., entry, maturation and latent virus reactivation [75] [76] [77] [78] . Regarding the role of DUBs in HIV-1 replication, it has been shown that the ESCRT-III interacting DUB AMSH (associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM) can inhibit viral particle production, while AMSH knockdown did not influence virus release [79] . Interestingly, AMSH has been reported to bind to the ESCRT-III component CHMP3 upon coexpression, which then acts as inhibitor of HIV-1 release [80] . Recently, selective DIs have become available and facilitate the investigation of the role of DUBs in viral replication. Some of these DIs allow selective targeting of just one of the 90 known DUBs which might be one explanation for their relatively low toxicity [81] [82] [83] [84] . However, an antiretroviral activity of DIs has been reported herein for the first time.

Despite the tremendous effort that has been made to improve the classical, combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), which mainly blocks mutation-prone viral targets, there is an increasing risk for treatment failure resulting from drug resistance, incompliance, and adverse effects. While there is still a great medical need for continuous development of novel antiretroviral drugs [85] , the focus is currently on cellular targets that are genetically a million times more stable and thus harbor a much lower risk of drug resistance [86, 87] . Small molecules, which affect cellular targets, offer a treatment alternative for interruption of cART in case of drug intolerance or development of multi-resistant HIV-1 variants. In this study, we could provide first evidence that the DIs P22077 and PR-619 not only block the replication of the HIV-1 T cell culture adapted molecular clone NL4-3, but also of the multi-resistant field isolate HIV-1 4lig7, which possesses resistance against all NRTIs and most of the protease inhibitors used in cART [50, 51] . Moreover, we could demonstrate that structural treatment with DIs P22077 and PR-619 on day 1 and 3 post infection can completely block spread of infection with similar efficacy as permanent treatment and without affecting cell viability. This indicates that a complete and comprehensive block in the production of progeny viruses, occurring early during spread of infection in the cell culture, must have been achieved by DI treatment that efficiently enables eradication of virus replication. One explanation for this observation might be the reduced infectivity of virions released under DI treatment, which is most likely due to impaired Gag processing. However, additional impact of DIs on HIV-1 genomic RNA packaging, or the incorporation of the Env glycoprotein into budding virions, as well as on the activities of regulatory proteins, like Tat, Rev or Vif, might also account for this phenomenon.

The DIs P22077 and PR-619, which share the same cellular targets, namely USP7 and USP47, but not the USP7 specific DI P5091, exhibit antiretroviral activity indicating that USP47 alone or together with USP7 might play a major role in HIV-1 replication. It has been shown previously that USP47 is specific for the cleavage of K48-linked polyubiquitin chains and thus prevents the proteasomal degradation of substrates [88] . We could show that treatment with DIs targeting USP47 leads to an enhanced polyubiquitination and entry of Gag into the MHC-I pathway, indicating that USP47 somehow interacts with Gag and prevents its entry into the UPS.

It has been shown previously that the inhibition of the proteasome leads to an accumulation of polyubiquitinated Gag species, which interfere with Gag-processing [38] . Later, it was shown that proteasome inhibitors interfere with HIV-1 replication in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) [64] . In this study, we could show that the addition of the DIs leads to an accumulation of polyubiquitinated Gag species and a reduction in Gag-processing. Thus, we speculated that the combinatory treatment of HLAC with DIs and proteasome inhibitors might synergistically inhibit virus replication. Si et al. have previously shown that DIs boost the inhibitory effect of proteasome inhibitors on Coxsackie virus replication [89] . However, in this case DIs alone had no effect on replication of Coxsackie virus and there was no supra-additive effect detectable, even when both inhibitors were added at high concentrations. Possibly, both inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors and DIs, are necessary Viruses 2017, 9, 222 16 of 22 to efficiently reduce the pool of free Ub, which has been shown to be necessary to block Coxsackie virus replication [89] . On the contrary, our data illustrate that DIs can enhance the effect of proteasome inhibitors on the inhibition of HIV-1 replication at very low, supra-effective concentration levels of both inhibitors. When applied individually, neither proteasome inhibitors nor DIs had any influence on the HIV-1 replication at these low concentrations. Thus, our results suggest that both inhibitors, DIs and proteasome inhibitors induce synergistic effects, without affecting cell viability.

There are mainly two possible explanations for the synergistic effect of DIs and proteasome inhibitors: First, the amount of free ubiquitin is significantly reduced by the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins and the lack of recycling of polyubiquitin chains. This might interfere with the function of the ESCRT-complex as early acting ESCRT factors like ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II, and ALG-2 interacting protein X (ALIX) possess ubiquitin binding domains, and thus ubiquitin may play an important role in their substrate recognition [90] [91] [92] [93] . Second, the addition of DIs together with proteasome inhibitors might lead to the accumulation of so-called defective ribosomal products (DRiPs). DRiPs are de novo synthesized erroneous proteins, which are rapidly degraded via the UPS. Originally, it was shown that the HIV-1 Gag protein is a bona fide substrate for the DRiP-pathway [94] and proteasome inhibitors lead to an accumulation of DRiPs [38] . Combinatory treatment of cells with DIs might lead to a further enhancement of accumulated Gag-DRiPs within the cell. Thereby, those Gag-DRiPs interfere with virus release by disturbing the highly ordered assembly of Gag molecules in a prion-like manner [38] .

In this study, we observed that DIs cause a general Gag processing defect. One explanation for this phenomenon would be that DIs directly inhibit the viral protease. However, this possibility could be excluded as in vitro processing assays revealed that the applied DIs, even at high concentrations, had no effect on the viral protease. Another explanation might be that polyubiquitin chains conjugated to Gag sterically disturb the highly ordered lattice of assembling Gag and thus exert a negative effect on the highly ordered Gag-assembly during virus budding, and eventually also on the auto-activation of the viral protease. Another possibility may be the direct masking of the viral protease cleavage sites by bulky polyubiquitin adducts. Accumulation of processing intermediates has been shown previously to interfere with viral infectivity in a trans-dominant negative manner [61] , which is in concert with our observations that treatment with DIs P22077 and PR-619 reduces virus infectivity in a dose-dependent manner.

The K48-linked polyubiquitination of proteins is a pre-requisite for the proteasomal degradation [95] . Although the steady state amounts of Gag were not affected by the addition of DIs, the MHC-I antigen presentation as the final consequence of proteasomal degradation, was significantly enhanced. This finding is in concert with previous studies which show that an enhanced MHC-I antigen presentation did not necessarily correlate with the diminished half-life of Gag [26, 48] . A possible explanation for this observation might be that just a minor fraction of Gag enters the UPS following treatment with DIs and this does not reduce the overall level of Gag that remains non-ubiquitinated. In consistency with this possibility is the notion that only a fraction of de novo synthesized proteins (approx. 5-10%) are entering the DRiP-pathway [96] . Numerous studies show that targeting an antigen for degradation by the 26S proteasome represents a powerful approach to enhance MHC class I antigen presentation and to induce an efficient cytotoxic T-cell (CTL)-response [97] [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] . We now show that also DIs can cause a significantly enhanced MHC class I antigen presentation of Gag-derived epitopes. Thus, it is legitimate to speculate that DIs not only reduce viral replication but might also induce a better CTL recognition of HIV-1 + cells in vivo.

Overall, these data support a model, whereby certain DUBs play an important role in HIV-1 replication as they regulate Gag processing and thus the infectivity of released virions and simultaneously the entry of Gag into the UPS and MHC-I pathway.

Reducing burden of disease from residential indoor air exposures in Europe (HEALTHVENT project) Reducing burden of disease from residential indoor air exposures in Europe (HEALTHVENT project)

This paper attempts to understand optimal ventilation rates at the national level across 26 European countries and to contrast the benefits of optimizing ventilation with filtration of outdoor air pollution and control of indoor sources. This is an important topic given the key role of the housing sector in tackling both air pollution and climate change. Although the methods used are relatively simplistic, they are appropriate for analyses performed at the scale presented in the paper. The findings and conclusions are well supported by the results. I would therefore support publication. However, I believe the manuscript would benefit from a stronger statement of the aims of the work and some clarifications regarding the methods (see below).

My main concern relates to the assumption made by the authors that indoor-generated PM2.5 is equally as harmful to health as outdoor-generated PM2.5. There is little evidence to support this (though it is quite a commonly made assumption). I would like to see some form of sensitivity analysis in relation to this assumption, since it may have an impact on the final results (though probably not on the ultimate conclusions).

More detailed comments can be found below. I consider the suggested revisions to be relatively minor.

1. Is the question posed original, important and well defined?

The research question posed by the paper is important and I believe the methods used are appropriate to answer it. However, the aims of the paper are not currently well stated (in both the main text and in the abstract). The main statement of the aims comes towards the end of page 5, which states "This work aims to summarize the current understanding of the sources of health risks in indoor environments and their relationship to ventilation requirements". This doesn't really capture what the authors have actually done. There is a slightly better statement of the aims hidden in the Methods (top of page 7) but even this doesn't quite feel sufficient.

2. Are the data sound and well controlled?

Yes, although the source of some of the input data can be made clearer in the text, especially in relation to Table 2 (see below) .

3. Is the interpretation (discussion and conclusion) well balanced and supported by the data?

Yes.

4. Are the methods appropriate and well described, and are sufficient details provided to allow others to evaluate and/or replicate the work?

The methods are generally well described. However, I have a few specific issues (see the additional comments below).

The methods are based on relatively simplistic tools (both the mass-balance exposure model and the risk/health impact model). However, I think they are appropriate for the type of analysis presented in the paper.

My main concern relates to the assumption of equal health risk associated with both outdoor-and indoor-generated PM2.5. The authors discuss this briefly in the Discussion section but this assumption is highly uncertain since almost all of the published epidemiology is based on outdoor PM2.5. The paper would benefit from greater emphasis on the sensitivity of the results to this assumption. Perhaps, the analysis (or part of it) could be repeated without the effects of indoorgenerated PM2.5 or with a reduced exposure-response coefficient?

6. Can the writing, organization, tables and figures be improved?

Although the manuscript is generally well written, there are reoccurring problems, most importantly missing articles throughout the paper (e.g. a, the). For instance, in the abstract, "Based on measurements of the European Environment Agency (EEA),…" and "A framework for developing European health-based ventilation guidelines…" would be preferable. I realise that English is not the authors' first language (and, again, I should stress that most of the language used is very good). However, I think the paper would benefit from a thorough edit by a native English speaker.

Also, the figures appear to be quite pixelated and may not be in an appropriate format for publication.

7. When revisions are requested.

No preference.

8. Are there any ethical or competing interests issues you would like to raise?

None.

• I believe the abstract would benefit from a little editing. At present, the Background section feels unnecessarily long and there isn't enough detail in either the Methods or Results sections. The methods used for the health impact calculations aren't mentioned at all, despite being key to the paper. At the moment, I don't feel the main results are clearly stated in the abstract.

• The paper refers throughout to "optimization". I think a mathematician might object to the use of the term because the method doesn't actually use a formal optimization process. I don't think this is too much of a problem but I do think a clear statement of what the authors mean by optimization would be helpful (e.g. in the Methods). As I understand it, the "optimal" ventilation rate is just taken to be the one for which the health burden is smallest.

• I found some parts of the description of the risk model confusing, in particular towards the bottom of page 7. Firstly, the text states that the models are based on a predefined population attributable burden of disease for each exposure and disease. Is this simply referring to the calculation described later in the section (bottom of page 8)? Secondly, the text then states that "national estimates are then calculated from the national burden of disease data by scaling the attributable fraction according to the ratio of national versus European indoor concentration estimates for each pollutant". I'm afraid I could not follow the point being made here. Which "European" estimates are being referred to?

• On page 8 it is stated that "Traditional risk assessment methods estimate these [mortality and morbidity] separately as numbers of cases". I don't really agree with this statement. There are many health impact assessment methods which can consider both together and which are not incidence-based.

• The source of the data presented in Table 2 was not clear to me. Do these values relate to previous work by the authors? The source(s) used should be explained and appropriate references provided.

• The section describing the basis for the assumed source control levels (page 11) can be improved.

Although the authors provide an explanation of the methods that can be used to achieve such source control for each pollutant, it is not clear how the specific reduction % was decided upon in each case. Are the reductions based on evidence or just plausible best guesses? For example, how do you know that implementing compulsory alarms will reduce CO sources by exactly 90%?

The section would benefit from additional references to supporting literature.

• I do not understand why the source control scenario (scenario 3) did not also include an element of ventilation optimization. The start of the section describing the scenarios suggests that ventilation optimization would be "complemented" first by filtration and then by source control (page 9). This suggests that a ventilation optimization component would appear in all scenarios. Choosing just one "optimal" ventilation rate makes it difficult to ascertain the relative benefits due to ventilation and source control.

• There is a line on page 14 which states "substantial reductions have been proposed in the earlier work within the EU funded IAIAQ project". It is not clear what reductions are being referred to here. Is it reductions in the burden of disease due to indoor exposures? Why have reductions been proposed?

• The term "EU-26" is used throughout the paper and should be defined somewhere.

• There are two occasions where references are missing in the text (bottom of page 8 and below Table 3 ).

Dear Sotiris Please find my detailed comments on the attachment and my review below:

The manuscript "Healthy-Polis 1476-069X-14-S1-S6" focusses on the calculation of the annual burden of disease caused by exposure to indoor air pollution. This is very important work, given that the indoor environment is greatly ignored in relation to health.

The MS is generally well written and certainly merits publication.

Apart from some minor editing, as indicated in the attachment, my comments mainly aim to improve the reader's understanding. The areas requiring clarification are highlighted in the attachment together with some comments. The two most important ones are as follows:

1. Methods: My understanding is that the exposure analysis refers only to indoor exposure in the residential environment, without considering any time spent outdoors or in other indoor microenvironments; however, this is not clear in the text. Can you please clarify what the building stock represents.

2. The section on the "Risk model" directs the reader to several references of previous work. However, the reader may not be familiar with these methodologies and, most importantly, this significant part of the paper should stand alone. To enable a more friendly reading, the authors are kindly required to provide the data used in the methodology, step by step, as supplementary data (i.e. BoD, national estimates/statistics, PAF etc).This would improve a lot the quality and value of this publication. 

Framework for developing European health-based ventilation guidelines was created in 2010-2013 in the EU-funded HEALTHVENT project. As a part of the project potential of efficient control policies to reduce the burden of disease caused by indoor exposures was estimated. Analysis was based on scenario comparison using a model, which was based on mass-balance framework and changes in ventilation level.

The quantitative comparison of three main policy approaches, (i) changing ventilation rates only; (ii) filtration of outdoor air; and (iii) indoor source control, showed that all three approaches are able to provide substantial reductions in the health risks varying from approximately 20% to 44%, corresponding to 400 000 and 900 000 saved healthy life years in EU-26.

Health effects of indoor air exposures can be decreased by increasing ventilation and the present modelling shows that controlling indoor air sources plays a major role when selecting appropriate ventilation rate. In a case where indoor sources cannot be removed or their emissions cannot be limited to an accepted level, ventilation needs to be increased to remove remaining pollutants. In these cases outdoor air pollution become the major source of pollution in indoors, and it needs to be taken into account.

Particulate matter, mainly coming from outdoors to indoors, is the main cause of health effects of indoor exposures in all European countries.

In the period 2006-2010, focus on indoor air quality has been raised by WHO, who has issued specific guidelines addressing air exposure in indoor spaces [1, 2] infections, asthma, allergy, and short-term sick leaves), and an association between ventilation and productivity (performance of office work) was indicated.

Similar results were obtained in the review by Seppänen et al. (2004) [7] . They None of the studies included in the reviews specifically addressed the role of outdoor air quality on indoor exposures, even though 90% of EU citizens live in areas where the WHO guidelines for air quality for PM 2.5 is not met [10] . Neither was the existence of indoor air sources systematically analysed nor exposure levels quantified or considered when associating ventilation and health. Therefore the support from these previous studies on determining the best combination of source control and ventilation levels is limited. This work aims to summarize the current understanding of the sources of health risks in indoor environments and their relationship to ventilation requirements. The methods presented here allow for informed health-based optimization of efforts aimed at reducing harmful exposures and improving health of the occupants. The results are intended for development of national and international guidelines and standards, and can also be used as background information when

analysing indoor air quality related issues in buildings.

Ventilation plays a dual role in formation of indoor pollutant concentrations: on one hand it removes pollutants generated indoors from indoor spaces by ventilating the space with outdoor air, on the other hand, ventilation introduces outdoor air pollutants indoors [11, 12] . Assuming a constant outdoor pollution level and constant penetration efficiency, increasing ventilation directly leads to increased indoor exposures to outdoor pollutants. Even in the case of efficient filtering of particles in the intake air, detailed studies have shown that a substantial fraction of the outdoor air enters indoors via windows, doors, ventilation ducts, and cracks and leaks in the building envelope, leading to much lower actual filtration efficiency [13] .

Due to the counter-acting roles of indoor and outdoor air sources on indoor exposures, a mass-balance model is needed to address it when defining prevailing indoor concentrations. A commonly used approach based on Dockery and Spengler [14] and adopted in Hänninen et al. [11] , [15] is as follows:

where C i is the total indoor concentration (µg m -3 ) of the pollutant in question, C a is the concentration in the intake air, P is the probability of the pollutant remaining suspended after penetrating through the building envelope, α is air exchange rate (h -1 ), k is the deposition rate of the pollutant indoors (h -1 ), G is the indoor generation level (µg h -1 ), V is the volume and t is the temperature of the indoor space. The third term covering the transient impacts of changing concentration can be considered zero for the sake of long-term average exposures. Detailed input data and more details of calculations are presented in Hänninen and Asikainen (2013) [16] .

Because the aim of this study is to estimate how changes in ventilation affect exposures, the probability distributions of national ventilation rates in a building stock of year 2010 had to be estimated. Surprisingly limited data of measured ventilation rates are available for European countries. Due to this, available measured data was reviewed and a regression model was created combining the climatological and economical differences in the building stocks with ventilation rates. Further modelling with a Bayesian subjective probability approach was used for generation of lognormal probability distributions for ventilation rates in each EU-26 country ( Table 1 , method described in detailed elsewhere [17] ). Table 1 .

Large number of indoor air pollutants has been associated with health responses, but some of those either play a small role from the point of view of public health, or pose challenges for the exposure assessment or quantification of the burden of disease.

Health determinants of housing in general are discussed in WHO 2011 [18] , safe levels of specific chemicals indoors in WHO 2010 [2] and guidelines for exposure to dampness and mould specifically in WHO 2009 [1] . The current enhancement of the health impact assessment with the above described mass-balance approach to account for variable ventilation is built on the previous achievements of EnVIE [19] and IAIAQ projects [20] and the corresponding models for environmental burden of disease caused by indoor air quality. These models were based on a predefined population attributable burden of disease (BoD) for each exposure and disease and national estimates are then calculated from the national burden of disease data by scaling the attributable fraction according to the ratio of national versus European -8 -indoor concentration estimates of each pollutant. (i.e. PM 2.5 , outdoor bioaerosols, VOC, carbon oxide (CO) radon and dampness). In the current work the earlier PM 2.5 , radon and dampness models were updated to the relative risk-based population attributable fraction (PAF) approach but keeping the IAIAQ disease classification. In addition, second hand smoke exposures at home were added using exposure data from a European survey [21] .

Exposures to environmental pollutants are associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Traditional risk assessment methods estimate these separately as numbers of cases. The results from such incidence-based models are not comparable over different types of health endpoints and to improve comparability of impacts on various types of diseases and including mortality, disability adjusted life years (DALY) has been proposed as a common metric [22] . (Table 1 ) and calculating the population attributable fraction (PAF) as [Error! Reference source not found.]:

where f is the fraction of population exposed to a given factor and RR is the relative risk of the exposed population. Now if the background burden of disease (BoD) is known the environmental burden of disease (EBD) caused by the current exposures ( Table 3 . Table 2 . Table 3 .

Three alternative exposure control scenarios were evaluated using the mass-balance enhanced burden of disease model to evaluate their efficiency to reduce BoD. The exposure control scenarios start from optimizing the ventilation rates only. As it proves inefficient, it is complemented firstly with control of filtration of outdoor pollutants and secondly with control of indoor sources.

The first exposure reduction scenario is defined as finding the health-based optimum ventilation rate without any other actions that change indoor or outdoor sources. In this scenario the pollutant concentrations from indoor and outdoor sources compete so that pollutants from indoor sources are decreasing and pollutants from the outdoor sources are increasing when the ventilation rate is increased. The health-based -10 -optimum level of ventilation is solved for each country among EU-26 by calculating burden of disease with ventilation rates from 0.1 to 50 lps pp.

The calculations assume that all indoor originating exposures follow the mass-balance dilution even though this is not self-evident for several indoor originating pollutants, especially radon, dampness, mould and carbon monoxide. Radon infiltrates typically from the soil below the buildings, and the infiltration may react to the under pressure indoors, which may increase in some ventilation systems at higher ventilation rates.

Dampness may also be created by condensation and may thus increase at higher ventilation rates. Carbon monoxide is lethal at high exposure levels and more efficient dilution by higher ventilation may not be sufficient. However, for all these pollutants the benefits of higher ventilation rates are calculated assuming the mass-balance for a constant source term.

Previous analyses of the sources of indoor exposures have shown that outdoor air is a significant source of exposures. Therefore the second scenario was determined as an attempt to control the burden of disease by filtration the exposures originating from outdoor air. Because both ultrafine and coarse particles and chemically reactive pollutants like ozone have lower infiltration factors than PM 2.5 , dominated by accumulation mode particles, the filtration was specified for PM 2.5 particles.

Three levels of filtration were compared. The baseline estimates assume that 90% of the outdoor PM 2.5 mass concentration penetrates indoors. In addition, realistic but increasingly challenging penetration levels of 70% and 50% were evaluated. These correspond to effective filtration of PM 2.5 mass concentration by 27% and 45%, respectively, filtration levels that can be achieved in real buildings at least when using mechanical ventilation systems [13] . When discussing the filtration efficiencies of filters and the above mentioned penetration efficiencies, it has to be noted that the -11 -penetration efficiency is defined for the building, accounting for leaks and ventilation from windows, doors etc.

The health-based optimum ventilation was defined in this scenario also, and used when calculating the burden of disease results and the reduction potential compared to the baseline scenario.

The third approach to optimizing ventilation for health focuses first on indoor sources of exposures. Now, instead of attempting to dilute these sources as they are, they are first assumed to be controlled by other means as much as technically feasible before optimizing the ventilation for health. The assumed control potentials for the considered pollutants were:

• -90% for radon, carbon monoxide (CO) and second hand smoke (SHS)

• -50% for volatile organic compounds (VOC) and dampness • -25% for particulate matter (PM 2.5 )

These hypothetical source controls were defined to approach maximum technically feasible reductions. The radon estimate assumes efficient application and control of radon safe construction in radon-prone areas combined with control of second hand smoke exposures known to act synergistically with radon. Efficient second hand smoke reductions have already been demonstrated in Finland in both workplaces and in homes resulting a decrease in proportion of adolescents exposed to SHS from 17% in 1991 to 6% in 2009 [25] and the SHS policies are moving forward also on at European level. The carbon monoxide controls were aimed to be implemented by compulsory alarms that will allow for identification of malfunctioning devices before the risks occur.

VOC controls can be reached by comprehensive labelling systems for low emission products. Dampness controls need to combine structural improvements with -12 -active/online and passive warning sensors. The most challenging element was considered to be particulate matter. The proposed 25% reduction can be achieved with target exhausts in kitchens, avoiding use of candles and improved design of combustion devices.

To provide some sensitivity analysis to estimate the effectiveness of source control, two other scenarios with lower and higher source control capabilities were also analysed. In the lower source control scenario (scenario 3.1) it was assumed a reduction of 80% for radon, CO and SHS and 25% reduction of PM 2.5 , VOC and dampness exposures. In the higher source control scenario (scenario 3.2) a total control (100%) of radon, CO and SHS and 75% reduction of PM 2.5 , VOC and dampness exposures were assumed.

In all source control scenarios the ventilation level was set to be 4 lps pp, which was defined as base ventilation rate in cases when ventilation must handle only human bio-effluent emissions (carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and moisture) by work done in HealthVent to define the health based ventilation requirements [26] .

Exposures to indoor and outdoor originating pollutants were associated with a burden 

Overall in EU-26, over 50% of the total annual burden of disease associated with indoor exposures (4000 DALYs/million) is estimated to be caused by PM 2.5 originating from outdoor air, followed by particles from indoor sources, and radon ( Figure 3) .

The contribution of different sources to the total DALYs varies between countries.

This can be seen when comparing the sources of the burden of disease in Finland ( Figure 3 ) and in other EU-26 countries (Table 4 ) with the population-weighted mean of EU-26 countries. It is readily apparent that in Finland the role of ambient particles is lower than in Europe in general, but that both bio-aerosols (pollen) and radon play much more significant roles. Especially the contribution of radon is double to that of the European average, highlighting the geology peculiarities of the Finnish soil.

-14 -However, in Finland the burden of disease from lung cancer caused by radon exposures is alleviated partly by lower smoking prevalence. On average, 31% of over 15-year olds smoke daily or occasionally in EU countries and the smoking figures are lower only in Finland (25%), Sweden (25%) and Slovakia (22%) [21] .

Dampness and mould problems continuously raise a lot of attention in Finland, too.

Nevertheless, the burden of disease in Finland is from the lower end on the European scale (ranging from 1% to 11%), and only 3% is estimated to be caused by dampness in comparison with average of 5% in EU-26. 

The burden of disease caused by indoor exposures, estimated above to be over 4 000

DALYs per year per a population of 1 million in EU-26, is significant. However, also substantial reductions have been proposed in the earlier work within the EU funded IAIAQ project [20] . The three alternative scenarios (and two additional source control scenarios) described earlier were tested to support policy development for controlling the risks and reducing the burden. The overall comparison of these scenarios in EU-26 is presented in Figure 4 . The achievable health benefits were 20% for the dilution scenario, 38% for the filtration scenario, and 44% for the indoor source control scenario (changing from 41% to 54% depending on assumed source reductions). (Table   1 ) [16, 17] .

Approximately twice as high benefits are achievable by filtration of outdoor air in However, largest health benefits can be achieved by the source control approach (scenario 3.0), which significantly reduces the need to control exposures by dilution.

The benefits are approximately 44% from the baseline, or 940 000 DALYs in EU-26, and changing from reduction of 41% (865 000 DALY) with lower source control assumptions to 57% (1.21 million DALY) with higher source control assumptions, demonstrating source control to be more effective than dilution or filtration even with smaller reductions of source exposures.

In addition to of higher health benefits, in comparison with the filtration-based scenario 2 the advantage is that with source control the lower dilution need (i.e.

-16 -enabling lower ventilation rate) allow also for lower infiltration of outdoor particles and therefore the feasibility of the approach is better in the current building stock.

Moreover, with lower ventilation rates require the source control approach is likely to prove also more energy-efficient.

Further analysis of the contribution of indoor and outdoor sources on these scenarios shows, that with the dilution scenario the health benefits are not only due to smaller proportion of the indoor contribution (i.e. the dilution of the pollutants from the indoor sources) but is mainly based on the lower ventilation rates that actually limits the penetration of the outdoor pollutants to indoors.

In the filtration scenario the health benefits are due to filtration of the outdoor pollutants and also effective dilution of the indoor pollutants as the health-based optimal ventilation levels are higher.

Also in the source control scenarios the health benefits are a result of both effects;

firstly by the lower indoor sources due to the source control and secondly by lower penetration of outdoor pollutants due to low level of ventilation.

The results suggest that (i) there is a substantial burden of disease associated with exposures through inhalation taking place indoors and that (ii) these risks can Largest health benefits were projected for the source control policies. It is obvious that the benefits are achievable only if the source controls work as efficiently as proposed and that the efficiency of the source controls must be confirmed with follow-up (e.g. auditing) of exposure levels after the policy enforcement.

-19 -

Over 2 million disability adjusted life years (DALY) are annually lost in the European Union due to compromised indoor air quality, but this burden of disease can be reduced by adjusting ventilation, filtration of intake air and by controlling indoor sources. All three approaches are able to provide substantial reductions in the health risks from approximately 20 % to almost 50%, corresponding to 400 000 and 900 000

saved DALYs in EU-26. Thus selection of strategies has substantial impact on the expected benefits.

The projected health benefits can be achieved if the controls on ventilation and sources are fully implemented as defined in the scenario descriptions. In the case of selecting some of the proposed strategies for implementation, a careful follow-up plan has to be developed for ensuring that the controls are effective and match the requirements of the benefit calculations. -28 - 

NAR Breakthrough Article A novel role for poly(C) binding proteins in programmed ribosomal frameshifting

genes. Frameshifting is induced by mRNA secondary structures that compromise ribosome fidelity during decoding of a heptanucleotide 'slippery' sequence. The nsp2 PRF signal of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus is distinctive in directing both −2 and −1 PRF and in its requirement for a trans-acting protein factor, the viral replicase subunit nsp1␤. Here we show that the the trans-activation of frameshifting is carried out by a protein complex composed of nsp1␤ and a cellular poly(C) binding protein (PCBP). From the results of in vitro translation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we demonstrate that a PCBP/nsp1␤ complex binds to a C-rich sequence downstream of the slippery sequence and here mimics the activity of a structured mRNA stimulator of PRF. This is the first description of a role for a trans-acting cellular protein in PRF. The discovery broadens the repertoire of activities associated with poly(C) binding proteins and prototypes a new class of virus-host interactions.

In programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF), mRNA signals induce a proportion of translating ribosomes to slip back by 1 nucleotide (nt) into an overlapping open reading frame (ORF) and to continue translation, al-lowing the coordinated expression of two or more proteins from a single mRNA (1) (2) (3) . First described as the mechanism by which the Gag-Pol polyprotein of the retrovirus Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) is expressed from overlapping gag and pol ORFs (4), related −1 PRF signals have been documented in many other viruses of clinical, veterinary and agricultural importance (reviewed in Ref. 5 ). PRF has also been increasingly recognized in conventional cellular genes of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes as well as in other replicating elements, such as insertion sequences and transposons (6, 7) .

Central to almost all examples of −1 PRF is the interaction of the ribosome with a stimulatory mRNA structure (a stem-loop or RNA pseudoknot) which promotes frameshifting on a stretch of homopolymeric bases known as the slippery sequence. How these RNA structures act is incompletely understood, but accumulating evidence supports the view that by presenting an unusual topology (1, 2, (8) (9) (10) (11) they confound an intrinsic unwinding activity of the ribosome with consequent effects on the elongation cycle and frame maintenance (12) (13) (14) . Indeed, kinetic analyses in bacterial systems indicate that stimulatory RNAs can impair movements of the ribosomal small subunit (30S) head, delaying dissociation of EF-G and the release of tRNA from the ribosome (15) (16) (17) .

Recently, we identified a novel, highly efficient −2/−1 PRF event that functions without a recognizable stimulatory RNA secondary structure (18, 19) . This signal operates during translation of the genome of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a member of the family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales (20) . The PRRSV genome (Figure 1 ), a positive-sense RNA molecule some 15 kb in length, harbours two PRF signals. A 'canonical' −1 PRF element, including a stimulatory RNA pseudo- The ∼15-kb PRRSV genome has two long 5 ORFs, 1a and 1b encoding non-structural polyproteins (nsps) and at least eight shorter 3 ORFs (2a-7) encoding structural proteins. ORF1a and ORF1b are translated from the genomic RNA, with translation of ORF1b depending on −1 PRF at the end of ORF1a. The TF ORF overlaps the central ORF1a region in the −2 reading frame and is accessed via −2 PRF (18) . A −1 frameshift at the same site generates the nsp2N product. Shown below is the sequence of the SD01-08 RNA in the region of the −2/−1 PRF signal, with the slippery sequence (purple) and C-rich motif (red) highlighted. The −1 reading frame stop codon is underlined and codons for each of the reading frames are indicated. (B) Crystal structure of the PRRSV nsp1␤ dimer (32) . The putative RNA binding domain is in orange (see text). (C) RNAs derived from FspI-cut pDluc PRRSV/wt, or a variant with the −1 frame stop codon (panel A) changed to UUA (PRRSV/stop), were translated in RRL in the presence of the indicated concentrations of His-tagged nsp1␤ (M) or with nsp1␤ dilution buffer (DB). The products were resolved by 12% sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and visualized by autoradiography. 14 C molecular size markers were also run on the gel (M). Products generated by ribosomes that do not frameshift (stop) or that enter the −1 or −2 frames are indicated. The asterisk indicates the −1 PRF product of the PRRSV/wt construct.

The second signal, which stimulates both −2 PRF and −1 PRF, is located within the region of ORF1a that encodes a large, multifunctional replicase subunit, non-structural protein 2 (nsp2). Here, about 20% of ribosomes translating nsp2 frameshift into the −2 reading frame to generate a transframe fusion protein (nsp2TF) comprising the N-terminal two-thirds of nsp2 and a C-terminus derived from a conserved, overlap-ping ORF (transframe; TF) in the −2 reading frame. A further 7% of ribosomes shift into the −1 reading frame where they immediately encounter a stop codon resulting in the synthesis of a truncated version of nsp2 termed nsp2N (19) . As shown in Figure 1A , the RNA downstream of the slippery sequence (GG GUU UUU) used for −2/−1 PRF in PRRSV does not harbour an obvious secondary structure compatible with canonical RNA-structure-stimulated PRF. However, mutations within a conserved CCCANCUCC motif located 11 nt downstream of the shift site reduce or Nucleic Acids Research, 2016, Vol. 44, No. 12 5493 inhibit frameshifting, consistent with the presence of a 3 stimulatory element of some form (18) . A further novelty of the PRRSV −2/−1 PRF signal is an essential role for the 25-kDa viral replicase subunit nsp1␤, which functions as a trans-activator of both −2 and −1 PRF ( Figure 1B) (19) . Nsp1␤ is one of the 14 subunits produced from the PRRSV replicase polyproteins. How it acts in PRF is unclear but replacement of basic residues within a highly conserved putative RNA-binding motif located in the papain-like autoproteinase (PLP) domain of nsp1␤ have a detrimental effect on frameshifting (19) .

Through reconstitution of the PRRSV −2/−1 PRF signal in vitro, we show here that in addition to the viral transactivator nsp1␤, efficient frameshifting requires the participation of cellular poly(C) binding proteins (PCBPs). In mammalian cells, two PCBP subsets have been described, hnRNPs K/J (21) and the ␣CP proteins ␣CP1 and ␣CP2, often referred to as PCBP1 and PCBP2 (22, 23) . The latter group also includes the more recently described paralogues PCBP3 and PCBP4 (24) . PCBPs are members of the KH domain superfamily of nucleic acid binding proteins and have a wide spectrum of biological activities, including the regulation of RNA splicing, the stabilization of cellular and viral mRNAs, transcriptional activation and inhibition, and translational silencing and enhancement (reviewed in Refs. 25, 26) . Using in vitro translation and RNA binding assays, we demonstrate that a complex of nsp1␤ and PCBP binds to the RNA downstream of the slippery sequence and mimics the action of the more typical RNA pseudoknot stimulators of programmed frameshifting. This unprecedented frameshift-stimulatory signal provides new insights as to how the ribosomal elongation cycle can be modified by trans-acting protein factors. Further, it broadens the repertoire of activities associated with poly(C) binding proteins and prototypes a new class of virus-host interactions.

Assessment of in vitro frameshift efficiencies employed pDluc/PRRSV wt and mutant derivatives. This vector contains the GG GUU UUU shift site, 5 upstream nucleotides (nt) and 66 downstream nt (79 nt in total) inserted between Renilla and firefly luciferase reporter genes of plasmid pDluc (27) such that −2 PRF is required for firefly luciferase expression. Protein expression vectors were as follows. PCBPs were cloned into pQE30 (Qiagen) at the BamH1/HindIII (PCBP1, 2, 3) or Sph1/HindIII (PCBP4) sites. Human PCBP1 (NM 006196.3) and PCBP2 (NM 005016.5) in pQE30 were kindly provided by Professor B. Semler, University of California, Irvine. PCBP3 (NM 021568.2 and XM 006513919.2) and PCPB4 (NM 033008.2 or XM 006713271.1) were obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using purified mRNA from mouse BV2 and human HeLa cells, repectively. Human hnRNP K/J (NM 002140.3; derived from HeLa cell mRNA by RT-PCR) was cloned into BamH1/XhoI-cut pET21a (Novagen). Nsp1␤ was cloned into BamH1/HindIII-cut pQE30 and BamH1/XhoI-cut pGEX6P2 (GE Healthcare). For analysis of ribosomal pausing, a 39-bp region of the PRRSV PRF region (with defective slippery sequence GGUAUUC, flanked by wildtype (WT) sequences comprising 5 nt upstream and 27 nt downstream) was cloned into the XhoI/PvuII sites of pPS0 (28) . Assessment of PRF efficiencies in cultured cells employed pL-nsp1␤-2, which encodes a self-cleaving nsp1␤-nsp2 polyprotein under the control of a T7 promoter (19) . Poliovirus P3/Leon/37 (accession number K01392.1) IRES SLIV was prepared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from plasmid pGemCat/PVIRES/Luc (kind gift of Dr Graham Belsham) and cloned into BamH1/EcoR1-cut pcDNA3.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged proteins expressed in pQE30 or pET21a were purified from Escherichia coli TG1 or BL21/DE3/pLysS cells. Single colonies were picked into Luria-Bertani broth and grown at 37 • C to an OD 600 of 0.6. Protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl ␤-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (to 0.1 mM) and continued for 2 h at 37 • C (or overnight at 22 • C) after which cells were pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM MgCl 2 , 1.4 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% Tween 20, 500 mM NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme). Cells were incubated on ice for 30 min and sonicated to complete lysis. Protein purification was performed using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA; Qiagen) according to standard procedures (29) . Nterminally glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-tagged nsp1␤ was expressed in BL21/DE3/pLysS cells as above and purified using glutathione agarose resin (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to standard procedures (30) . Proteins were dialysed against 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.05 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 5% glycerol, quantified by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) and stored at −80 • C until required.

Frameshift reporter plasmids were linearized with FspI and capped run-off transcripts generated using T7 RNA polymerase as described (31) . Messenger RNAs were translated in nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) or wheat germ (WG) extracts (Promega) programmed with ∼50 g/ml template mRNA. Typical reactions were of 10 l volume and composed of 90% (v/v) RRL, 20 M amino acids (lacking methionine) and 0.2 MBq [ 35 S]-methionine. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 30 • C and stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 10mM EDTA, 100 g/ml RNase A followed by incubation at room temperature for 20 min. Samples were prepared for sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) by the addition of 10 volumes of 2× Laemmli's sample buffer, boiled for 4 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Dried gels were exposed to a Cyclone Plus Storage Phosphor Screen (PerkinElmer), the screen scanned using a Typhoon TRIO Variable Mode Imager (GE Healthcare) in storage phosphor autoradiography mode and bands were quantified using ImageQuant TM TL software (GE Healthcare). The calculations of frameshifting efficiency (%FS) took into account the differential methionine content of the various products and %FS was calculated as % −1FS

and similarly for % −2FS. In the formula, the number of methionines in the stop, −1FS and −2FS products are denoted by MetS, MetFS1 and MetFS2 respectively; while the densitometry values for the same products are denoted by IS, IFS1 and IFS2, respectively. All frameshift assays were carried out a minimum of three times and the measured frameshift efficiencies (±SEM) are provided in the Supplementary Data.

WG in vitro translation reactions (30 l) were supplemented with 1 M nsp1␤, PCBP2 (or KH mutant derivative) or both proteins and programmed with mRNAs derived from AvaII-cut pPS0/PRRSV WT or pPS0/PRRSV CC2. Reactions were incubated at 18 • C for 5 min prior to addition of edeine to 5 M. Aliquots (1.5 l) were subsequently withdrawn at intervals post-edeine addition, mixed with an equal volume of 10mM EDTA, 100 g/ml RNase A and placed on ice. At the end of the time-course, samples were analysed by SDS-PAGE.

Short, 32 P-labelled template RNAs (58 nt) containing the PRRSV PRF region (with slippery sequence precisely at the 5 end and C-rich region towards the centre) were prepared by T7 transcription of a PCR product generated using primers flanking the frameshift region, with the 5 primer containing the T7 polymerase promoter sequence. Test proteins were diluted where necessary in dilution buffer (DB) (5 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.05 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol) and added to reactions (10 l final volume) alongside electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) buffer (10 mM Hepes pH7.6, 150 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM adenosine triphosphate, 5% glycerol, 100 g/ml porcine tRNA, 10U RNase inhibitor per ml), after which the radiolabelled probe was introduced. After incubation at 30 • C for 10 min, samples were loaded promptly onto 4% acrylamide non-denaturing gels (acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio 10:1) and run at 175V at room temperature until free and bound RNA species were resolved. Gels were fixed for 15 min in 10% acetic acid, 10% methanol, dried and exposed to X-ray film.

For each protein tested, 40 l of a 50% suspension of glutathione-agarose beads was centrifuged (500 g, 5 min), the supernatant removed and the beads washed sequentially with 200 l water and thrice with GST wash buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT). Following incubation with nsp1␤ (6 g) for 1 h at 4 • C on a rotating wheel, the protein was removed and the beads washed three times with GST wash buffer. Test protein (2 g) was added to the beads and the incubation and washing steps repeated, with the GST wash buffer supplemented with 0.1% NP-40. After removal of the final wash, 25 l 4 × Laemmli's sample buffer was added, the beads boiled for 5 min and supernatants analysed by SDS-PAGE.

Trans-activation of PRRSV −2/−1 PRF by nsp1␤ was previously demonstrated by co-expression of nsp1␤ and nsp2 in cultured cells and by site-directed mutagenesis of the viral genome (18, 19) . To study the phenomenon in vitro, a 79-bp fragment encompassing the slippery sequence and Crich region was subcloned between the Renilla and firefly luciferase genes of a frameshift-reporter plasmid (pDluc) such that expression of the downstream cistron (fluc) was dependent upon −2 PRF within the inserted PRRSV sequences. In RRL in vitro translations, mRNAs transcribed from pDluc/PRRSV specified the synthesis of only the product of the 5 cistron of the reporter mRNA (Rluc) and no frameshifting was evident ( Figure 1C ). However, supplementation with recombinant, purified His-tagged nsp1␤ yielded two additional proteins, the most abundant corresponding to the product of −2 PRF. The second protein migrated more rapidly than that of Rluc and we surmised that this protein corresponded to the product of a −1 PRF, as a −1 frame stop codon is present immediately downstream of the slippery sequence (underlined in Figure 1A ). To confirm this, the −1 frame stop codon (UGA) was changed to UUA, which extends the −1 reading frame by 56 codons and simultaneously introduces a 0-frame stop codon UAA thus shortening the Rluc gene. As expected, this point mutation increased the size of the predicted −1 PRF product, and slightly reduced the size of the Rluc protein (stop). These experiments indicate that the 79-nt region cloned into pDluc likely contains all of the cis-acting elements required for PRRSV −2/−1 frameshifting and that supplementation of the RRL translations with nsp1␤ alone is sufficient to transactivate frameshifting to levels similar to those seen in infected cells (−2 PRF, 17%; −1 PRF, 7%; see Supplementary Table) . The stimulation of PRF by nsp1␤ was specific to the PRRSV signal in that the protein had no effect on frameshifting at a variety of well-established sites of viral −1 PRF (Supplementary Figure S1) . Furthermore, the protein was unable to promote stop codon readthrough at variants of the PRRSV signal with an in-frame stop codon placed within the slippery sequence at the position that would be decoded in the peptidyl-(P) or aminoacyl-(A) site of the ribosome (Supplementary Figure S1) .

The crystal structure of nsp1␤ ( Figure 1B ) reveals an overall ellipsoidal structure consisting of six ␣-helices and seven ␤-strands with two major domains, a 48-amino-acid N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal papain-like cysteine protease (PLP1␤) domain (32) . Within the latter domain, we previously identified a conserved motif 123 GKYLQRRLQ 131 (19) as a potential RNA binding motif (RBM) that forms one of three ␣ helices in the region between the catalytic residues of PLP1␤ (C 96 and H 165 ; Ref. 19 ). To investigate the importance of these activities to Nucleic Acids Research, 2016, Vol. 44, No. 12 5495 trans-activation of PRF, amino acid substitutions were introduced into the protease active site (C96S; PR) or within the putative nsp1␤ RBM (K 124 A/R 128 A, mutant RBM; previously described as mutant 1␤KO (Li et al., (19) ) and the expressed variants tested in RRL ( Figure 1D ). In this experiment, the protease-defective variant retained full activity, ruling out the involvement of the protease activity of nsp1␤ in the stimulation of PRF. In contrast, the RBM mutation prevented frameshifting, supporting a role for RNA binding by nsp1␤.

To assess the role in PRF of sequences 3 of the slippery sequence, a series of in-frame deletions were introduced into pDluc/PRRSV, starting from the 3 end of the inserted PRRSV sequence. RNAs transcribed from these plasmids were translated in RRL in the presence of nsp1␤ ( Figure  2A ). PRF was found to be unaffected until the length of the PRRSV sequence downstream of the slippery sequence fell below 21 nt, at which point PRF was reduced (18 nt) or abolished (15 or 9 nt). In the latter constructs, the C-rich region is compromised, consistent with an important role in PRF. Similar results were previously observed in transfected cultured cells (Li et al., (19) ). To investigate the function of the C-rich region specifically, we prepared a library of individual point mutations within, and flanking, the Crich region and assessed their effect on PRF ( Figure 2B ). It was found that changing any of the C residues to G had a detrimental effect on PRF, with the exception of the final residue (C 13 , 3 of the conserved sequence), where the effect was more modest. As an explanation for these observations, we speculated that the RNA downstream of the slippery sequence may interact with PCBPs. The 'minimal' region of PRRSV RNA required for full activity in PRF (21 nt) has only two C-rich patches, whereas previously established PCBP-binding consensus sequences more commonly have three (or more) C-triplets, potentially with each triplet binding one KH domain ((33); see below). However, PCBP1 and PCBP2 are amongst several candidates reported to associate with GST-tagged nsp1␤ in association screens, and a direct physical interaction between the two has been shown (34, 35) . PCBPs could therefore bind to the PRRSV mRNA by virtue of an association with nsp1␤.

To explore the potential role of PCBPs in PRRSV PRF, we translated the pDluc/PRRSV mRNA in RRL reactions supplemented with nsp1␤, His-tagged human PCBP2, or both proteins ( Figure 3A ). We found that PCBP2 alone did not affect PRF (right hand lane), but when added together with nsp1␤, synthesis of the −1 PRF product was stimulated some 3-fold (see Supplementary Table) . We reasoned that if the 'active' trans-acting stimulator of PRF in PRRSV is a complex of nsp1␤ and PCBP, the RRL system may already contain an abundant form of PCBP, but one which would, in complex with nsp1␤, preferentially induce −2 PRF. In this experiment, supplementation with PCBP2 may have generated nsp1␤-PCBP2 complexes that could preferentially promote −1 PRF. We therefore translated the PRRSV frameshift reporter mRNA in the WG in vitro translation system on the basis that this lysate might contain fewer endogenous PCBPs, or PCBPs of sufficient evolutionary divergence to preclude any interactions with nsp1␤. Consistent with our hypothesis, PRF at the PRRSV signal in WG was found to be completely dependent upon the addition of both nsp1␤ and PCBP2, with neither protein alone having any frameshift-stimulatory activity in this system ( Figure 3B ). Further, supplementation of WG translations with PCBP2 led preferentially to a −1 PRF, whereas with human PCPB1, −2 PRF was most evident (Figure 3C) , suggesting that the abundant form in RRL is PCBP1. We also tested mouse PCBP3, human PCBP4 and mouse hn-RNP K/J in WG translations ( Figure 3C and D) . Of these three proteins, only PCBP3 was able to promote frameshifting, with both −2 and −1 PRF products observed at similar levels ( Figure 3C ). We confirmed the involvement of PCBP1 and 2 in frameshifting in cultured cells using siRNAs (Supplementary Figure S2 ). Knockdown of PCBPs individually or together substantially reduced PRF, with PCBP1 noticeably affecting −2 PRF, and PCBP2, −1 PRF, consistent with the results of the WG assays above. No effect on PRF was seen with siRNAs targeting PCBP3, PCBP4 or hnRNP K/J, although we could not verify knockdown of PCBP3 due to lack of a reactive antibody.

RNA binding by the PRRSV PRF trans-activators was investigated using EMSAs. A short (58 nt) 32 P-labelled transcript encompassing the minimal PRRSV frameshiftstimulatory region was incubated with nsp1␤, PCBP1 (or PCBP2) or both proteins, prior to electrophoresis on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Figure 4A , a single RNA-protein complex was observed, the formation of which required both nsp1␤ and PCBP1 (or PCBP2). Using a broader range of PCBP2 concentrations at saturating levels of nsp1␤, the estimated K d of the interaction was found to be 130 nM (Supplementary Figure S3) . In the presence of PCBP2, the PR mutant of nsp1␤ was able to bind the target RNA indistinguishably from the WT protein, but the RBM mutant gave a smeary pattern, indicative of weak, non-specific, RNA binding (Supplementary Figure S3) . As a control, a version of the RNA probe mutated in the C-rich region (CC2, Ref. 18) was also tested, and no nsp1␤/PCBP2 binding was evident (Supplementary Figure S3) . A supershift assay was carried out to confirm nsp1␤ and PCBP association with the RNA in the complex. The PRRSV RNA was incubated with nsp1␤ and PCBP2 and subsequently with specific antibodies targeting either protein prior to EMSA. As shown in Figure 4B , in lanes from reactions with an added anti-PCBP2 monoclonal antibody, an additional band of slower mobility was seen consistent with the presence of PCBP2 in the RNA/protein complex. A monoclonal antibody targeting the NTD of nsp1␤ did not yield a novel EMSA product, but a more slowly migrating species was observable with a polyclonal anti-nsp1␤ serum. These observations support the view that the RNA/protein complex seen contains both proteins.

We carried out competition experiments to assess whether the WT PRRSV mRNA, the PRF-defective CC2 variant or a known PCBP2-binding RNA from poliovirus Figure S4) . Consistent with expectation, a dose-dependent reduction in frameshifting efficiency was observed upon addition of short, uncapped transcripts containing the WT PRRSV PRF signal or IRES stem-loop IV RNAs, but not with the control mRNA with the C-rich stretch mutated.

PCBP family members have three KH domains, an adjacent pair (KH1 and KH2) close to the N-terminus and a third (KH3) towards the C-terminus, separated from KH1 and KH2 by an intervening sequence of variable length ( Figure  3D ). To test the involvement of individual KH domains in PRF, amino acid substitutions (to GDDG) were introduced within the conserved, hallmark GxxG loop in each domain, which forms part of the RNA binding domain. These mutations have been shown previously to abolish RNA bind- ing activity of the individual domain without compromising its stability (37) . As shown in Figure 5A and B, mutation of the KH2 domain of PCBP1 or PCBP2 had little, if any, effect on frameshifting, whereas the KH3 domain mutation essentially abolished trans-activation. The KH1 domain mutation had a more varied phenotype. With PCBP1, frameshift-stimulation was greatly reduced, but for PCBP2, −2 PRF was diminished four-fold, but full activity in −1 PRF was retained. Further, whilst addition of PCBP1 KH1m or PCBP1 KH3m alone was unable to stimulate PRF, when (A) EMSA analysis of binding of nsp1␤, PCBP1 or PCBP2 (alone or in combination) to a short (58 nt) 32 P-labelled in vitro transcript containing the PRRSV PRF signal. After incubation at 30 • C for 10 min, reactions were loaded onto a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and, following electrophoresis, the gel was fixed, dried and subjected to autoradiography. Numbers below lanes show fold molar excess of protein(s) with respect to the radiolabelled RNA (10 nM). In lanes BSB, DB and W, RNA was incubated alone with band-shift buffer, protein dilution buffer or water, respectively (see 'Materials and Methods' section). (B) The composition of RNA-protein complexes was investigated by supershift assay. Complexes were prepared with 10 nM RNA and a 50-fold molar excess of nsp1␤ (N) and PCBP2 (P2) and subjected to EMSA directly (N, P2, NP2), or after incubation with monoclonal (mono) or polyclonal (poly) antisera raised against PCBP2 (␣P2, mono) or nsp1␤ (␣N, mono or poly). As controls, the radiolabelled RNA probe was incubated with either DB, the ␣P2 mono or the ␣N poly. added together, a partial restoration of both −2 and −1 PRF (to about 20% of the WT value) was observed (Figure 5C ). Note that in all assays, frameshift-stimulation remained dependent upon addition of nsp1␤ ( Figure 5D ).

From the lack of effect of the KH2 mutation on PRF, we conclude that interaction of this domain with RNA does not occur (or is unnecessary for PRF) and that mutations within the GxxG loop of KH2 do not compromise the specific interaction with nsp1␤. However, the KH1 and KH3 mutations likely modify the interaction of the protein with RNA, and conceivably, with nsp1␤. EMSA analysis confirmed the predicted effects on RNA binding, which was reduced in the case of PCBP2 KH1m , abolished with PCBP2 KH3m and largely unaffected for PCBP2 KH2 (Figure 5E ). Similar results were seen with PCBP1 (Supplementary Figure S5 ). To assess the capacity of the various PCBPs to bind nsp1␤ independently of RNA, a pull-down assay was utilized (Supplementary Figure S6) . Here, immobilized GST-nsp1␤ was incubated with individual His- tagged PCBPs and, after a detergent wash, bound protein was eluted for analysis by immunoblotting. In comparison to WT PCBP2, the binding of PCBP2 bearing any of the three KH domain mutations to GST-tagged nsp1␤ was unaffected, indicating that the effects on PRF are related to changes in RNA binding rather than a reduced capacity to associate with nsp1␤. Indeed, PCBPs 1-4 all bound nsp1␤ in this assay, thus the inability of PCBP4 to trans-activate PRF at the PRRSV signal has some other explanation. Importantly, GST-tagged nsp1␤ RBM was able to pull-down PCBP2, indicating that the defect in this mutant is not in the capacity to associate with its protein partner.

Spacing. A hallmark of RNA structure-dependent PRF signals is the necessity to maintain a precise spacing between slippery sequence and stimulatory RNA to position the ribosome appropriately at the slip-site (38, 39) . The importance of spacing in PRRSV frameshifting was assessed in WG translations programmed with reporter mRNAs with spacer lengths of 4-13 nt ( Figure 6 ). Efficient PRF was seen over a narrow range (9-11 nt), with shorter spacers leading preferentially to −2 PRF and longer spacers preferentially to −1 PRF. This pattern of frameshifting is highly reminiscent of that observed with stimulatory RNAs and suggests that the nsp1␤/PCBP complex functionally mimics such RNAs. The optimal spacer length was subtly different for the two PCBPs, with maximal PRF (−2 and −1) seen at longer spacer lengths for added PCBP1 compared with PCBP2. Thus the capacity of the various PCPBs to promote frameshifting into a particular reading frame is likely set by the position and/or conformation of the protein complex on the template, affected by subtle differences in the position of KH domains within the proteins which influences 'effective' spacer length.

Pausing. Ribosome pausing at structured RNA stimulators of PRF has been widely documented and may play a mechanistic role (2) . We tested whether the nsp1␤/PCBP2 complex could also induce pausing by cloning the PRRSV signal (with a defective slippery sequence) in-frame within a reporter gene and translating in vitro derived mRNAs in the WG system. The extent of pausing was estimated by comparing the levels of a translational intermediate corresponding to pausing at a bound nsp1␤/PCBP2 complex with that of the full-length polypeptide produced during a time course in which translation was synchronized by the addition of edeine, a potent inhibitor of initiation, 5 min after the start of the reaction. A control mRNA was prepared from plasmid template linearized at the position of the inserted PRRSV signal to serve as a pause marker. As can be seen in Figure 7 , pausing was clearly evident in the presence of nsp1␤/PCBP2, but far less so with either protein alone, or on an mRNA lacking the C-rich region. The appearance of the pause product was transient (albeit visible over several minutes), consistent with its identity as a genuine intermediate rather than a dead-end product. In Figure 7C , further pausing assays were carried out to examine the activity of the PCBP2 KH domain mutants (in the presence of nsp1␤). We found a positive correlation between the extent of pausing observed and the activity of the three mutants in specific RNA binding, namely a little for PCBP2 KH1m , close to WT levels for PCBP2 KH2m and much less pausing for PCBP2 KH3m .

A role for PRRSV nsp1␤ protein in PRF was the first description of a protein trans-activator of this process (19) . Here, we show that the active frameshift-stimulatory element in fact comprises a complex of viral nsp1␤ and a cellular poly(C) binding protein. PCBPs have been shown to regulate gene expression at multiple levels, including transcription, mRNA processing, mRNA stabilization and translation (reviewed in Refs. 25, 26) . Hitherto, a role for PCBPs in protein synthesis has been limited to translation initiation, mostly in the recruitment of ribosomes to viral IRESes (see Ref. 40) . Their activity in stimulating PRF in PRRSV is the first example of a role for PCBPs in modulating translational elongation.

The induction of PRF by the nsp1␤-PCBP complex has clear parallels with cis-acting structured RNA stimulators, including the capacity to induce a ribosomal pause and the necessity for maintaining a precise distance between slippery sequence and stimulatory element. In RNA structuredependent PRF, interaction of the stimulatory RNA with the ribosome impairs movement of the small subunit head during translocation, destabilizing the hybrid state and elevating energy barriers corresponding to subsequent substeps of translocation (15) (16) (17) . Completion of translocation is accelerated by slippage of tRNAs into the −1 frame, thus promoting PRF. At the PRRSV signal, the bound nsp1␤-PCBP complex would also be in close proximity to a ribosome actively decoding the slippery sequence, facilitating interactions between them. In this light, it may be significant that in pull down assays, nsp1␤ has been shown to interact with rpS14 (34), a protein immediately adjacent to a component (rpS3) of the putative ribosome-associated mRNA unwinding activity (13) and PCBP1 is known to interact with RACK1 (41), a ribosome-associated protein located close to the mRNA entry channel. Details of the molecular interactions that take place upon encounter of elongating ribosomes remain to be determined.

The geometry and stoichiometry of the nsp1␤-PCBP complex on the PRRSV mRNA is uncertain and difficult to predict. Nsp1␤ exists as a dimer in solution (32) , PCBPs have been shown to be capable of homo-and heteromultimerization and RNA binding by PCBPs could reflect interaction with single or multiple KH domains (42) (43) (44) . Binding assays with optimized RNA targets generated by in vitro SELEX have revealed that a tandem array of three C-patches maximizes PCBP2 binding to its RNA target (45) and several established PCBP binding sites contain three or more C-patches (33, 46) . However, the sequence motifs implicated in PCBP binding from gene expression analysis of human cells (47, 48) and Caenorhabditis elegans (49) comprise predominantly two adjacent C-rich patches, although it is not known how strongly PCBPs bind to these targets, nor whether any other cellular proteins participate in the interactions. The EMSA data presented here reveal that alone, PCBP1 and PCBP2 bind weakly to the PRRSV C-rich region (which has two C-patches), requiring nsp1␤ for stable binding. Similarly, nsp1␤ binds RNA very weakly, but is evident in complexes (with PCBPs) from supershift assays. Stable complex formation on the mRNA thus likely depends upon conformational changes in one or both molecular partners and potentially, direct contact between nsp1␤ and mRNA. In support of the latter, we found that amino acid substitutions in the putative RBM) of nsp1␤ greatly weakened the association of the complex with RNA, without apparent effect on the interaction with PCBP2. Yeast two-hybrid studies (35) have shown that the reciprocal interaction of nsp1␤ and PCBP2 requires the C-terminus of nsp1␤, including the protease domain (PLP1␤) and Cterminal extension, and the KH2 domain of PCBP2. In light of this, we hypothesize that the association of nsp1␤ with KH2 would not preclude binding of nsp1␤ to RNA. An alternative interpretation is that nsp1␤ RBM fails to induce a conformational change in PCBPs necessary for stable RNA association.

Our model for PRRSV −2/−1 PRF is that PCBPs interact with the PRRSV mRNA through KH1 and KH3, with each domain contacting one of the two C-patches (CCCA and CUCC) within the C-rich region. The KH2 domain itself is not associated with the RNA, serving rather to bind nsp1␤, with the complex poised to subvert the elongating ribosome. In its capacity to stall ribosomes, the nsp1␤-PCBP complex joins a growing list proteins that have been shown to modulate the elongation step of protein synthesis. These include Stm1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which inhibits translation after 80S formation (50) , the fragile X mental retardation protein, which reversibly stalls ribosomes on its target mRNAs (51) by binding directly to the ribosome (52), the HIF-1␣ mRNA-associated cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 2, which binds eEF2 and slows elongation (53) and the PUF-Ago-eEF1A complex that attenuates elongation after the nascent peptide emerges from the ribosomal exit tunnel (54) . Stalling of ribosomes by the nsp1␤-PCBP complex, perhaps as a consequence of a direct interaction with the unwinding centre of the small subunit, could promote PRF in a manner similar to that described for structured RNA stimulators.

Not all PCBPs were capable of stimulating PRF. The lack of activity of PCBP4 and hnRNP K/J is potentially a consequence of differences in overall size and domain organization. PCBP1, 2 and 3 are globally similar, with KH domains located at analogous positions in the protein, whereas the linker separating KH2 and KH3 is shorter in PCBP4 and much longer in hnRNP K/J ( Figure 3D ). These differences did not affect association of PCPB4 with nsp1␤, but could affect the strength of binding of individual KH domains to RNA or alternatively, preclude generation of a correctly oriented or positioned complex on the mRNA. With the KH domain mutants of PCBP1 and PCBP2, we largely observed an excellent correlation between activity in RNA binding, ribosomal pausing and the capacity to induce PRF. However, we saw differential activity in PRF of the KH1 domain mutants of PCBP1 and PCBP2, with the former barely active yet the latter retaining function in promoting −1 PRF, but with reduced −2 PRF. When RNA association was examined by EMSA, PCBP1 KH1m and PCBP2 KH1m bound to the PRRSV RNA with similar affinity and in an nsp1␤-dependent manner, although binding was noticeably reduced in comparison to the WT proteins. This suggests that PCBP1 KH1m and PCBP2 KH1m still associate with the RNA, but the stability, conformation or position of the complex may be changed such that only in the case of PCBP2 KH1m is PRF possible, and only −1 PRF (which is the predominant frameshift event for WT PCBP2 at the natural spacing distance). As noted in the 'Results' section, compensatory activity in PRF was detected upon mixing the individually inactive PCBP1 KH1m and PCBP1 KH3m , suggesting that two (or more) PCBPs can cooperate to stimulate frameshifting. The differential activity of PCBP1 KH1m and PCBP2 KH1m could reflect an altered capacity to homo-oligomerize.

The trans-activation of −2/−1 PRF by nsp1␤/PCBP has intriguing parallels with a recently described translational readthrough event in human vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) mRNA (55) . Here, lowfrequency stop codon readthrough at the end of the proangiogenic VEGFA coding sequence appends an additional 22 amino acids to the C-terminus, generating the VEGF-Ax isoform which possesses anti-angiogenic activity. The readthrough event is promoted by the binding of hnRNP A2/B1 to a recognition element 10 nt downstream of the recoded VEGFA stop codon. Similar to PCBPs, hnRNP A2/B1 is known to associate with nascent cellular RNAs and influence their localization, maturation and function (56) . How it acts to stimulate readthrough is unknown, but it is striking that both hnRNP A2/B1 and the nsp1␤/PCBP complex promote their respective recoding events from a similar distance 3 of the ribosome, suggesting that they may contact the ribosome directly. How they subvert translation likely differs in each case as we were unable to uncover any stop codon readthrough activity of the nsp1␤/PCBP2 complex (Supplementary Figure S1) .

Our description of a role for PCBPs in ribosomal frameshifting adds to a growing number of examples of viral subversion of PCBP function. In the best characterized system, poliovirus, the capacity of PCBPs to associate at two discrete genomic RNA locations and in concert with different protein partners is critical to almost all aspects of the virus replication cycle (reviewed in Ref. 57 ). Whether such complex regulatory circuits operate during PRRSV replication and transcription remains to be determined. PCBP2 has been shown to associate with the 5 untranslated region of the PRRSV genome and may be involved in genome replication or translation initiation (34, 35) . Furthermore, the relative abundance and location of PCBPs in the cytoplasm of infected cells could be important in determining the precise ratio of non-frameshifted (full-length nsp2) and trans-frame (nsp2TF, nsp2N) products at various stages of the replication cycle.

Presently, stop codon readthrough in VEGFA (55) and PRF in PRRSV (19, this work) represent the only two examples of specific modulation of translational decoding (recoding) mediated by proteins. The participation of hnRNPs in each case may reflect the versatility of these proteins in linking sequence-specific nucleic acid binding with specific protein-protein interactions and serving as a fulcrum for multilateral molecular cross-talk (58) . It seems highly unlikely that protein-mediated recoding will be restricted to the two present examples, given the plethora of hnRNPs and other RNA binding proteins present in host and viral proteomes.

Involvement of Autophagy in Coronavirus Replication

Coronaviruses are single stranded, positive sense RNA viruses, which induce the rearrangement of cellular membranes upon infection of a host cell. This provides the virus with a platform for the assembly of viral replication complexes, improving efficiency of RNA synthesis. The membranes observed in coronavirus infected cells include double membrane vesicles. By nature of their double membrane, these vesicles resemble cellular autophagosomes, generated during the cellular autophagy pathway. In addition, coronavirus infection has been demonstrated to induce autophagy. Here we review current knowledge of coronavirus induced membrane rearrangements and the involvement of autophagy or autophagy protein microtubule associated protein 1B light chain 3 (LC3) in coronavirus replication.

Coronaviruses are single stranded positive sense RNA viruses belonging to the order Nidovirales, and are known to infect a variety of hosts. Several human coronaviruses have been identified, causing mainly mild respiratory infections, with the exception of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In addition, coronavirus infections have an economic impact on livestock industries worldwide. The avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), causes infectious OPEN ACCESS bronchitis (IB), a mild respiratory infection, but as a consequence is responsible for serious effects on the global poultry industries due to poor weight gain in broiler chickens as well as reduced egg production and egg quality in layers. In addition, some strains of IBV are nephropathogenic whilst others result in severe pathology in the reproductive organs. Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) causes respiratory infection and diarrhoea in cattle, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) cause diarrhoea in pigs and porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) causes vomiting and wasting disease in pigs.

Following attachment of coronavirus particles to virus specific receptors on the host cell and uptake of the virus into the cytoplasm, viral genomic RNA is released. This genomic RNA is recognised directly by the host cell translation machinery and two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, of approximately 400 and 800 kDa are translated. The two polyproteins encode the 15 (IBV) or 16 (all other coronaviruses) non-structural proteins (nsps), which are generated by co-or post-translational cleavage by virally encoded proteases. These proteins assemble into viral replication-transcription complexes (RTCs), providing the virus with the enzymes required for viral RNA transcription and replication, as well as proof-reading and capping of new viral transcripts [1] . In addition, expression of the nsps triggers the rearrangement of host cell membranes, presumed to provide a platform for the assembly of RTCs. It is likely that expression of the membrane associated nsps 3, 4 and 6 is responsible for inducing these rearrangements. Data from closely related arterivirus, equine arterivirus (EAV), demonstrated that expression of nsps 2 and 3 (homologues of nsps 3 and 4 in coronaviruses), in the absence of other viral proteins, was sufficient for the induction of membrane rearrangements and mutation of nsp3 blocked this function [2, 3] . Non-structural protein 4 from MHV is known to play a role in formation of rearranged membranes because viruses containing mutant nsp4s show defects in membrane rearrangements and a reduction in virus replication [4, 5] . Furthermore, co-expression of nsp4 with the C-terminus of nsp3 from MHV resulted in the relocation of both proteins from diffuse in the cytoplasm to punctate [6] . The authors hypothesised that interaction between these proteins may result in the rearrangement of host membranes [6] . However, the precise mechanism by which the nsps induce membrane rearrangements remains to be elucidated.

The nature of membrane rearrangements has been well studied in both SARS-CoV and MHV infected cells by conventional transmission electron microscopy or by electron tomography. Both viruses have been shown to induce double membrane vesicles (DMVs) as well as regions of convoluted membranes [7] [8] [9] . Electron tomography data showed that the convoluted membranes in SARS-CoV infected cells were derived from and joined to the rough ER. In addition, the outer membranes of the DMVs were interlinked, studded with ribosomes and were also joined to the convoluted membranes and ER. Openings between the interior of the DMVs and the cytoplasm were not observed [7] . In contrast, ribosomes were not seen on the membranes of MHV induced structures [8] . Preliminary work presented here ( Figure 1 ) shows for the first time that IBV infection of mammalian Vero cells also results in the induction of DMVs. However, a detailed analysis of the membrane rearrangements triggered by IBV infection of mammalian and avian cells remains to be performed. The site of assembly of coronavirus RTCs is currently unclear. During the process of transcription and replication of the viral genome, both positive and negative sense RNAs are synthesised. As a result, dsRNA can form, possibly as a replicative intermediate. This dsRNA has been used as a marker for sites of viral RNA synthesis. However, in SARS-CoV infected cells, dsRNA was found to predominantly locate on the interior of DMVs while the majority of the nsps were found to locate on the convoluted membranes. High resolution immunofluorescence microscopy also demonstrated a separation in the signals for nsps and dsRNA. In addition, due to the lack of any connecting channels between the interior of DMVs and the cytoplasm, questions were raised about transport of RNA to sites of virus assembly at the ERGIC [7] . Subsequent work using 5-ethynyl uridine (EU) to label nascent RNA demonstrated a degree of co-localisation between EU and dsRNA signals at earlier time points of infection but this co-localisation was significantly reduced at later time points [10] . Therefore, further evidence is required to determine the precise location of coronavirus RTCs and the site of RNA synthesis.

Autophagy is a cellular pathway for self-degradation. The pathway allows a cell to degrade long-lived proteins, aggregated proteins and organelles during periods of starvation to provide nutrients for continued cellular processes, as well as playing an important role in cellular homeostasis, ageing and development [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . In addition, dysregulation of autophagy plays an important role in the development of some cancers [16] . During autophagy, regions of the cytoplasm become engulfed into double membrane bound vesicles termed autophagosomes. These vesicles then fuse with late endosomes/lysosomes, where the contents are degraded by lysosomal proteases (Figure 2 ). For detailed reviews of autophagy signaling, see [17, 18] . The major control complex for autophagy is MTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) which, when active, inhibits initiation of the pathway. MTOR senses amino acid levels, as well as levels of growth factors and glucose and genotoxic and ER stress. Under resting conditions, MTOR phosphorylates and inactivates the ULK complex, comprising unc-51-like kinase 1/2 (ULK1/2), focal adhesion kinase family-interacting protein of 200 kDa (FIP200) and mammalian ATG13. Under stimulatory conditions, MTOR is inactivated; the ULK complex becomes hypophosphorylated and relocates to the site of formation of the autophagosome, the phagophore. Formation of the autophagosome proceeds by addition of new membrane to the phagophore, as opposed to budding from an existing membrane, in a poorly understood process. However, a number of proteins are known to be required. Recruitment of these proteins occurs via the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) by the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex (PI3K), including BECN1 (Beclin 1). Inhibition of PI3K activity using drugs such as wortmannin and 3-methyladenine (3-MA), and sequestration of BECN1 by antiapoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl2) all inhibit autophagy.

Elongation of the autophagosome membrane and formation of the complete autophagosome requires the recruitment of 2 ubiquitin-like (Ubl) conjugation systems. In the first, ATG12 becomes conjugated to ATG5 in a process requiring the E1-like enzyme ATG7 and the E2-like enzyme ATG10. ATG12-ATG5 then binds to ATG16L and forms a large complex known as the ATG16L complex. This complex localises to the phagophore and can determine the site of conjugation of the second Ubl system. In this second system, microtubule associated protein 1B light chain 3 (LC3) is initially cleaved by ATG4 near the C-terminus at position G120 to generate cytoplasmic LC3-I. This subsequently becomes lipidated with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in a process requiring ATG7 and another E2-like enzyme ATG3 to generate membrane tethered LC3-II [19] . LC3-II is inserted into both the inner and outer membranes of the autophagosome, and as such, remains associated with the autophagosome throughout the pathway [20, 21] . As a result, LC3 has become an extremely valuable marker protein for studying autophagy. Figure 2 . Schematic of mammalian autophagy pathway. MTOR is the major control complex for autophagy. MTOR senses levels of amino acids, glucose and growth factors, as well as genotoxic and ER stress. Upon stimulatory signals, MTOR becomes inactivated and the ULK complex becomes hypophosphorylated and relocalises to the phagophore, along with PIP3, produced by class III PI3K complexes. The Atg16L complex and LC3II are also recruited to the growing autophagosome, allowing expansion of the membrane and fusion to give a complete autophagosome, engulfing organelles, aggregated proteins and intracellular pathogens. The autophagosome then fuses with a lysosome, resulting in the degradation of the contents and recycling of nutrients into the cytoplasm.

In addition to its role in cellular homeostasis, autophagy has been shown to have a function in innate immunity by degrading intracellular pathogens, including viruses. Furthermore, autophagy plays a role in presenting pathogen components to the immune system [22] [23] [24] [25] . Inhibition of autophagy has a positive effect on the replication or virulence of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) [26, 27] , Sindbis virus [28, 29] and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [30] . In addition, the capsid protein of Sindbis virus was found to be specifically targeted to the autophagosome via an interaction with the autophagy cargo receptor, p62 [28] . However, many viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade autophagy by inhibiting the pathway, or diverting the process to benefit virus replication. Many viral proteins have been identified that inhibit formation of autophagosomes. For example, HSV1 protein ICP34.5 binds to BECN1 and inhibits autophagosome formation and Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and murine γ-herpesvirus (MHV-68) encode Bcl2 homologues to bind to and inhibit BECN1 [26, 31, 32] . KSHV also encodes another protein to block LC3 processing by inhibiting ATG3 [33] . Other viruses have developed mechanisms to inhibit fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encoded protein Nef interacts with BECN1, inhibiting lysosomal fusion [34] . Influenza A virus protein M2 has also been shown to induce accumulation of autophagosomes as a result of inhibition of lysosomal fusion, possibly via an interaction with BECN1 [35] . Moreover, numerous viruses have been identified which require autophagy for optimal replication, including hepatitis B virus (HBV) [36] , poliovirus [37] , coxsackievirus, HIV-1 [38] , hepatitis C virus (HCV) [39] , Dengue virus [40, 41] and Japanese encephalitis virus [42] . Finally, poliovirus subverts autophagy in order to generate membranous structures required for assembly of viral replication complexes [37, 43] . For more detailed information about the role of autophagy in the replication cycles of viruses, see reviews [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] .

The presence of DMVs in coronavirus infected cells suggested that this group of viruses might, like other positive sense RNA viruses, utilise the autophagy pathway to generate the membrane structures required for replication. Initial work showed that MHV infection induced autophagy [50] . Nsp8 co-localised with LC3 throughout infection and the nucleocapsid protein N co-localised with LC3 early in infection, but this decreased over time. In addition, MHV replication was markedly reduced in ATG5 −/− embryonic stem cell lines but virus titre was rescued in the presence of an ATG5 expressing plasmid [50] . Further work using SARS-CoV again showed co-localisation between nsp8 and LC3 [51] . However, work by others using bone marrow derived macrophages lacking ATG5 or ATG5 −/− primary murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), showed that MHV replication does not require either an intact autophagy pathway or conversion of LC3I to LC3II. They did however confirm that SARS-CoV nsps co-localised with LC3 [52] . Recently, Schneider et al. demonstrated that SARS-CoV replication could also occur in ATG5 −/− MEFs, indicating no requirement for a complete autophagy pathway [53] . Interestingly, it was observed that virus replication was unaffected by the induction of autophagy in wild type MEFs [53] . Finally, de Haan et al. were unable to show co-localisation between MHV nsp8 and GFP-LC3 [54] , and Snijder et al. were unable to show co-localisation between SARS-CoV nsp3 and either endogenous LC3 or GFP-LC3A, GFP-LC3B or GFP-LC3C [9] . Despite the lack of clarity with regard to the requirement for autophagy during coronavirus infection, all studies did indicate that LC3 became punctate upon coronavirus infection, suggesting an induction of autophagy [9, [50] [51] [52] 54] .

Consistent with previous observations, recent experiments performed in mammalian cells using IBV showed that this avian coronavirus is also capable of inducing autophagy during infection [55] .

Here, further work was performed and individual expression of viral nsp6 was also capable of inducing autophagy, whereas nsp4 and nsp10 were not. Nsp6 induced autophagosomes fused with LAMP1 labelled lysosomes and autophagosomes were susceptible to wortmannin treatment. This indicates that bone fide autophagy was induced. Interestingly, nsp6 homologues from SARS-CoV, MHV and arterivirus porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), also induced autophagy.

The mechanism for the induction of autophagy was not determined, although it was shown not to be by induction of ER stress, MTOR inhibition or via sirtuin 1. In addition, it was not confirmed whether nsp6 was responsible for the induction of autophagy in virus infected cells. However, in agreement with previous work, virus infection was not inhibited by the knockdown of ATG5 expression [55] .

In other work, it has been suggested that whilst endogenous LC3 could co-localise with MHV RTCs, GFP-LC3 showed significantly reduced co-localisation [56] . This may provide an explanation for some of the earlier experimental discrepancies. Further work in this study demonstrated that LC3 puncta were still observed in MHV infected ATG7 −/− cells, where LC3I to LC3II conversion cannot occur and also in cells expressing LC3 that cannot be processed to LC3II (LC3 G120A). In addition, although the absence of the complete autophagy pathway due to a lack of ATG7 did not alter MHV replication, reduced expression of LC3 by RNAi did significantly reduce virus replication. Furthermore, viral protein expression could be rescued in the presence of LC3 G120A [56] . This demonstrated that MHV replication does not require the complete autophagy pathway, or conversion of LC3I to LC3II, in agreement with previous work, but instead required LC3I [52] . Interestingly, MHV RTCs co-localise with markers for cellular EDEMosomes [56, 57] , vesicles involved in ER associated protein degradation (ERAD) tuning and knockdown of EDEMosome cargo receptor SEL1L reduced virus replication [57, 58] . In the ERAD pathway, unfolded proteins are removed from the ER and targeted for degradation. However, under normal conditions, the ERAD machinery must be regulated to prevent premature removal of proteins before they have been folded [59] . During ERAD tuning, parts of the ERAD machinery are removed from the ER in EDEMosomes to down regulate the pathway [57, 58, 60] . LC3I is recruited to EDEMosomes by transmembrane protein SEL1L [57] and possibly acts as a coat protein [60] . This work has highlighted a role for LC3 as part of the ERAD tuning pathway, but not autophagy, in the replication of MHV. Whether this pathway is involved in the replication cycles of other coronaviruses remains to be determined.

Although mounting evidence suggests that autophagy is unlikely to play a role in the replication of coronaviruses and the generation of coronavirus replicative structures, several questions remain unanswered. Work performed so far focusses mainly of members of the betacoronaviruses, MHV and SARS-CoV. Detailed characterisation of the membrane structures induced in cells infected with alphacoronaviruses, like transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), or gammacoronaviruses, like IBV, needs to be performed. Although these viruses are related, it is possible that there are differences in the mechanisms of membrane rearrangement and the types of structures induced. In addition, the location of RTC assembly and the site of viral RNA transcription and replication need to be identified. The membranes induced in MHV and SARS-CoV infected cells are complex and how the different structures play a role in virus replication is currently unknown. Furthermore, the mechanism by which these rearrangements are generated is not understood. Whether MHV induced membranes are altered upon inhibition of ERAD tuning and which proteins might be involved in hijacking the pathway remains unknown. Moreover, whether this pathway is important for the replication of other coronaviruses is also unknown.

Recently the replication of IBV has been shown to induce autophagy in mammalian cells [55] . Furthermore, individual expression of IBV nsp6, as well as nsp6 homologues from other viruses in the Nidovirales order, has been shown to induce autophagy [55] . However, the mechanism by which this induction occurs is unknown. Whether nsp6 is responsible for inducing autophagy in the context of whole virus would also be interesting to discover. In addition, as IBV is restricted to avian species, would similar observations be made in a more natural host model? Finally, several studies have shown that coronavirus infection induces autophagy [9, [50] [51] [52] 54, 55] . However, the pathway does not appear to be required for virus replication [52, 53, 55, 56] . Therefore, is autophagy acting as a cellular defence to virus infection and does the virus have mechanisms to control this response?

Article 69 1 Original research

Management of feline chronic gastroenteropathies has included intervention with both veterinary therapeutic formulas designed to manage non-specific gastrointestinal disorders and those designed with limited novel or hydrolyzed ingredients for management of food-responsive enteropathies and steroid-responsive enteropathies (inflammatory bowel disease). There have been few studies evaluating the use of dietary intervention for the management of feline chronic gastroenteropathy. This prospective, multi-center study evaluated the use of two commercially available feline veterinary therapeutic dry diets designed to manage non-specific gastrointestinal disorders in 28 cats with a history of chronic vomiting and/or diarrhea. The majority of cats enrolled in the study had a history of vomiting (n = 25), with a smaller number having a history of concurrent diarrhea (n = 2) or diarrhea alone (n = 3). Cats were excluded if diagnostic tests identified any systemic or infectious disease that could be associated with the clinical signs of vomiting or diarrhea, and if they were panhypoproteinemic, hypoalbuminemic, hypocobalaminemic, or had a Spec fPL ≥5.4 µg/L. Cats were randomized to one of two veterinary therapeutic diets for 4 weeks. Feeding of both therapeutic diets resulted in a numeric reduction in the number of vomiting episodes over the 4-week period, but no significant differences were seen between dietary interventions. When looking within dietary groups, significant differences were seen in cats fed Diet A with reductions of 69.1, 73.3, and 63.2% (p values of 0.008, 0.003, and 0.029) in weeks 2, 3, and 4, respectively, when compared to week 0. The probability of vomiting also showed significant reductions in cats fed Diet A between weeks 0 and 2, 3, and 4, with odds ratios of 0.008, 0.005, and 0.005, respectively (p values of 0.038, 0.23, and 0.23). Results of this study demonstrate that a veterinary therapeutic gastrointestinal formula can be effective in the management of feline chronic vomiting. Cats that fail to respond to this dietary approach after a 2-to 4-week trial may benefit from a limited novel or hydrolyzed ingredient formula and may require additional diagnostics to better characterize the underlying disease.

Keywords inTrODUcTiOn Dietary recommendation for the management of chronic gastroenteropathy in cats has included the use of both veterinary therapeutic elimination and veterinary therapeutic gastrointestinal formulas (1) (2) (3) . Veterinary elimination diets are designed to limit dietary antigens by incorporating uncommon or hydrolyzed protein ingredients and are utilized to diagnose and manage gastrointestinal and/or dermatologic conditions with an underlying food intolerance or food allergy. Veterinary gastrointestinal formulas differ in that they do not necessarily utilize unique or hydrolyzed protein sources but are designed with highly digestible ingredients to facilitate digestion and absorption of nutrients within a compromised gastrointestinal tract. Veterinary gastrointestinal formulas may also incorporate other dietary modifications such as adjustment of macronutrient distribution, fatty acid composition, and inclusion of dietary fibers and prebiotics. While nutritional intervention is commonly utilized to manage chronic gastroenteropathy in cats, there have only been a handful of reported studies evaluating the efficacy of nutritional intervention in naturally occurring disease (4-7). Guilford et al. showed that 49% of 55 cats with chronic gastrointestinal disease were responsive to dietary change, and 29% of the 55 demonstrated a food allergy or sensitivity with recrudescence of clinical signs upon diet re-challenge (4). In another study, eight cats with chronic diarrhea and/or vomiting responded to dietary therapy with a hydrolyzed diet after other medical and dietary interventions were unsuccessful (5) . Laflamme et al. demonstrated improvement in fecal score in 78.2% of 55 cats with chronic diarrhea fed either a low-fat (23% ME) or high-fat (45.1% ME) dry diet containing common ingredients (6) . Additionally, two canned therapeutic gastrointestinal formulas containing common ingredients were evaluated for the management of naturally occurring chronic diarrhea, demonstrating resolution to a normal fecal score in up to 46.7% of 15 cats (7).

While recent studies have focused on chronic diarrhea, less is known regarding dietary intervention with chronic vomiting. Vomiting is the primary clinical sign recognized in feline patients with chronic gastroenteropathy (4, 8, 9) . In the Guilford's study, vomiting was present in 51.4% of the cats, diarrhea in 31.4%, and vomiting and diarrhea in 17.1% (4) . Of patient visits to Banfield Pet Hospital ® between 2008 and 2012, 1.4% of total feline visits per annum presented with chronic vomiting alone, 0.4% with chronic diarrhea alone, and 0.1% with both chronic vomiting and chronic diarrhea (8) . An evaluation of 100 feline cases of chronic small bowel disease suggested that diagnostic evaluation and implementation of dietary management is indicated in cats with vomiting as infrequently as two times per month (9) . While the use of elimination diets containing novel and hydrolyzed protein sources has been evaluated (4, 5) , to the authors' knowledge, no studies to date have evaluated the efficacy of feeding a nonspecific gastrointestinal therapeutic diet to cats with chronic gastroenteropathy with vomiting included as one of the primary clinical signs.

Cats with chronic vomiting and/or diarrhea were recruited by a multi-center group of primary care veterinarians in the greater Cincinnati region. Cats with at least one episode of vomiting and/or diarrhea per week for a minimum duration of 3 weeks, with no more than three episodes of vomiting daily were included. The vomitus excluded those defined as hairball only but could include hair material if present in addition to food and/or bile. Cats were at least 1 year of age, with a body condition score (BCS) between 2 and 4 on a 5-point scale, and housed exclusively indoors. Cats were excluded if they were fed a veterinary therapeutic diet; had a known food allergy; had a history of undesired weight loss in excess of 10% over the last 2 months; had received antibiotic therapy within the last month; received long-acting immunosuppressive drugs within the past 6 weeks; or had received any immunosuppressive drugs within 3 weeks prior to enrollment.

Cat owners were required to be at least 18 years of age, be the primary caregiver of the cat, be able to monitor the frequency of vomiting and/or diarrhea, and be able to report the daily occurrences via a daily automated phone call from an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). Cats from multi-cat households (up to four cats maximum) could be included, but only one cat was eligible to participate in the study and all cats in the house-hold were required to be fed the same study diet. Additionally, the owner had to be able to monitor the frequency and occurrence of vomiting and/or diarrhea from the cat participating in the study.

On day 0, all cats underwent a baseline physical examination and blood was submitted for complete blood count, serum chemistry panel, total serum thyroxine concentration (Total T4), feline pancreas-specific lipase (Spec fPL), and serum cobalamin and folate testing. Viral screening consisted of feline coronavirus (FCoV) antibody by indirect fluorescent antibody and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) antigen and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) antibody by ELISA. Fecal examination included wet smear and zinc sulfate centrifugation flotation and a feline diarrhea PCR panel to detect Campylobacter coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin gene, Cryptosporidium spp., FCoV, feline panleukopenia virus, Giardia spp., Salmonella spp., Toxoplasma gondii, and Tritrichomonas fetus. Cats were excluded if diagnostic tests identified any systemic or infectious disease that could be associated with the clinical signs of vomiting or diarrhea, including, but not limited to FeLV, FIV, hepatic disease, renal disease, and hyperthyroidism. Cats were also excluded if they were panhypoproteinemic, hypoalbuminemic, hypocobalaminemic, or had a Spec fPL ≥5.4 µg/L. Cats that tested positive for FCoV antibody, C. perfringens enterotoxin gene, C. coli, and FCoV via the PCR fecal panel were not excluded from the study. All diagnostic analyses were conducted at a third party commercial laboratory. 1 Cats were randomized to be fed one of two commercial veterinary therapeutic dry gastrointestinal formulas, Diet A 2 or Diet B. 3 No additional foods or treats were permitted. All investigators and participants were masked to the identity of the diet. Study diets were re-packaged into white bags, sealed, and delivered directly to participating veterinary clinics by plant employees not participating in the study. Nutrient analysis (conducted internally at Iams Analytical Laboratory), caloric distribution, and ingredient composition is summarized in Table 1 . Cats were fed according to each product's feeding guidelines to maintain body weight.

On day 0, cats that met all of the inclusion criteria were randomized to receive either Diet A or Diet B. The randomization was balanced by site, presence of diarrhea, and the owner reported weekly average number of vomiting and/or diarrhea episodes. Randomization was conducted with an internally developed balance and assignment program through an electronic case record form. Withdrawal criteria included any identified condition that required immediate medical care. Owners were trained to use the feline Fecal Consistency Scale (FCS; Figure 1 ) and to respond to the daily IVRS phone call. On days 1-28, owners received daily IVRS phone calls to record the number of vomiting episodes and presence of diarrhea over the 24-h period. A diary was provided to track daily observations and to record daily FCS scores.

Owners were instructed to call the veterinary clinic if the cat did not consume the food, had a reduced appetite, reduction in body weight, or any other concerns. On day 14, the owner was called by a veterinary technician to confirm that cat was eating well, had not lost weight, and did not have any concerns or significant decline in their clinical condition. On day 28, the cats returned to the clinic for a final examination and diagnostic recheck (CBC, serum chemistry profile, and Spec fPL).

The weekly episodes of vomiting and diarrhea were analyzed with a mixed-effects negative binomial generalized linear model. Fixed effects in the model were week, diet, and the interaction between. The random effects were animal nested within clinic. For vomiting, the change from week 0 to weeks 1-4 for each diet and between diets was tested. For diarrhea, the change from week 1 to weeks 2-4 for each diet and between diets was tested. The negative binomial models were also used to test for an effect of positive fecal testing for FCoV, C. perfringens enterotoxin gene, and FCoV antibody on vomiting and diarrhea occurrences by changing the fixed effects to week and positive/negative and retaining the same contrasts. This same model was altered to have a response of the total vomiting occurrences over the 4 weeks and fixed effects of diet and age. Vomiting was also modeled against the initial Spec fPL values using a negative binomial model, as before, however with the change in vomiting from baseline as the interaction between. Random effects were animal nested within clinic. The same hypothesis tests were also performed comparing the change between weeks within and between diets.

All contrasts performed using the mixed-effects models were corrected for the multiple comparisons using stepwise correction, to achieve a family wise error rate of 5% within each measure. The hypothesis tests of correlations were corrected using the false discovery rate method of Benjamini-Hochberg, to the 5% level. These analyses were performed in R v3.2.0 (10) statistical software with libraries lme4 (11) and multcomp (12) .

Fifty-six cats were screened to participate in the study. Of the 56 cats, 4 did not meet the initial pre-diagnostic inclusion criteria. On day 0, 52 cats were randomized to 1 of the 2 study diets, of which 17 were found to either violate the inclusion or meet the exclusion criteria based on the results of the diagnostic screening. Seven cats dropped out of the study prior to the day 28 visit. Reasons for dropping out included unwillingness to eat the diet in four cats (two cats fed Diet A and two cats fed Diet B), withdrawn by owner due to continued diarrhea in two cats (one fed Diet A for 1 day and one fed Diet B for 4 days), and one owner declined to participate following screening for one cat. The final study population of 28 cats included 13 cats fed Diet A and 15 cats fed Diet B. One of the cats in the Diet A group was inadvertently given the wrong diet after 2 weeks; therefore, data for this cat were included for only the first 2 weeks of the feeding period.

Mean age was 8.0 years (SD = 3.9, range 2-15 years) and 6.5 years (SD = 3.6, 1.0-14 years) in cats fed Diets A and B, respectively. Spayed females represented 62% (n = 6) and 40% (n = 6), while neutered males represented 38% (n = 5) and 60% (n = 9) of cats fed Diets A and B, respectively. Mean body weight was 4.9 kg (SD = 1.3, range 3.0-7.3) and 4.6 kg (SD = 1.2, range 2.9-7.0); and mean BCS was 3.2 (SD = 0.6, range 2-4) and 3.1 (SD = 0.6, range 2-4) on a 5-point scale in cats fed Diets A and B, respectively. Results of the PCR fecal panel showed that 16 of the 28 cats (Diet A n = 9; Diet B n = 7) tested positive for C. perfringens enterotoxin gene; 1 cat (Diet A n = 1; Diet B n = 0) tested positive for C. coli; and 17 cats (Diet A n = 9; Diet B n = 8) tested positive for FCoV. Eighteen of the 28 cats (Diet A n = 10; Diet B n = 8) tested positive for FCoV antibody. There were no statistically differences in the baseline characteristics of the cats between diet groups, and diagnostic screenings showed no clinically meaningful differences.

Cats fed both Diets A and B had a numerical reduction in the mean weekly number of vomiting episodes, with little to no change in weekly diarrhea episodes, over the 4-week period ( Table 2 ). There were no differences between diet groups in the mean weekly number of vomiting or diarrhea episodes (p > 0.05). Significant differences were seen in vomiting episodes over time within cats fed Diet A between week 0 and weeks 2-4. These had fold changes in the number of vomiting occurrences Table 3) . Changes in vomiting episodes within cats fed Diet B did not reach significance over the 4-week study period (p > 0.05) ( Table 3) Table 4 ). The change in probability of vomiting within cats fed Diet B did not reach significance over the 4-week study period (p > 0.05) ( Table 4) .

Fecal Consistency Scale scores were available for only 4 (31%) cats fed Diet A and 10 (67%) cats fed Diet B. The model of FCS against day and diet over the 4 weeks showed no significant differences between the diets in the change in fecal score (p > 0.05). There was no correlation between the frequency of vomiting or diarrhea over the 4-week period and the presence of fecal enteropathogens detected via PCR or antibody testing (p > 0.05). Similarly, neither Spec fPL results nor age of the cat correlated with the frequency of vomiting over the 4-week period (p > 0.05).

While therapeutic veterinary gastrointestinal diets are commonly utilized in veterinary practice for the management of gastroenteritis, this was the first study to evaluate the efficacy of these diets in vomiting cats with chronic gastroenteropathy. The majority of cats in this study presented with chronic vomiting represented in 25 of the 28 cats (89%). There were no statistical differences between dietary treatments in the weekly mean vomiting frequency or change in weekly vomiting frequency over time. However, looking within dietary groups, cats fed Diet A showed a significant reduction in vomiting occurrences in weeks 2-4 compared to baseline, with a 63% reduction in the final week compared to baseline. Cats fed Diet B, while not reaching statistical significance, also showed a numerical reduction from baseline over the study period. Follow-up studies with additional cats are needed to better define the efficacy of Diet B and any potential differences between dietary treatments.

In addition to the change of mean weekly vomiting episodes within treatment groups, it was also of interest to consider the number of cats that reached resolution, or no vomiting episodes, over the weekly period. The probability of vomiting declined during the course of the study, with a significant decline in cats fed Diet A in weeks 2-4, with a 0.2 probability in the final week. Sixty seven percent (n = 8) of the cats fed Diet A and 47% (n = 7) of the cats fed Diet B had no vomiting episodes at the final week of the study. Of these 15 cats, 3 showed an episodic pattern over the 4-week period, with 1 or more weeks without vomiting followed by a later week with vomiting.

Chronic diarrhea was less common in this study population, with only two cats having concurrent vomiting and diarrhea and three cats with diarrhea alone. It was considered that there may have been a lack of awareness or appreciation of diarrhea in the cats given the absorptive nature of litter that could have made diarrhea less recognizable to owner. The FCS chart included images of stool within litter to help educate and increase awareness of the owners participating in this study; however, overall frequency of diarrhea remained low and did not significantly change over the 4-week period.

Data from Banfield Pet Hospital ® visits between 2008 and 2012 showed that older cats are more highly represented among cases of chronic gastrointestinal disease (8) . Because of this, it was considered that age may have been associated with more severe clinical disease; however, no significant correlation was observed between age and vomiting occurrence within this study population. Previous studies evaluating diagnostic outcomes of cats with chronic gastroenteropathy have shown that older cats (mean ages ranging from 9.3 to 12.6 years) were more likely to have an underlying neoplastic etiology compared to younger populations (mean age 7.7-8.9 years) (13, 14) . The population in this present study was relatively younger (mean age of 7.2 years) and likely had less severe disease than those evaluated in previous studies at tertiary referral practices. Given the risk of underlying neoplastic disease in cats with chronic gastroenteropathy, dietary intervention in conjunction with additional diagnostics is warranted in older patients.

Similar to previous reports, we found a relatively high prevalence of cats that were positive for FCoV antibody and C. perfringens enterotoxin gene (15) . Cats with a positive status were included within this study population, receiving dietary intervention alone. Similar to a previous report (15) , a positive status did not correlate with the occurrence of vomiting or diarrhea over the study period. It should be emphasized that the presence of FCoV antibody and C. perfringens toxin gene does not necessarily denote infection nor does it indicate the need to initiate medical therapy. Similarly, antimicrobial therapy for Campylobacter spp. is not recommended in animals that are not immunocompromised or showing systemic signs of illness (fever, hemorrhagic diarrhea, abnormal leukogram findings) as it can prolong the carrier state and the diarrhea typically selfresolves with supportive care alone (16) .

Both Diet A and Diet B are categorized as therapeutic gastrointestinal diets designed to manage non-specific acute and chronic gastrointestinal disorders. Although both diets share similar indications, there are nutritional differences between the two diets that are worth considering. The macronutrient distribution of protein, fat, and carbohydrate differed between the two formulas. The percent of calories from protein, fat, and carbohydrate were 31, 31, and 38% in Diet A and 35, 40, and 25% in Diet B, respectively ( Table 1) . While protein level was similar between the two formulas, the fat and carbohydrate contents varied more widely. Reduced dietary fat has been recommended in patients with gastroenteropathy due to potentially impaired fat absorption (7, 8) ; however, dietary fat was shown to have no difference in clinical response in cats with chronic diarrhea (6) . The presence of concurrent chronic pancreatitis has also been an indication for feeding reduced or moderate fat diets in cats with gastroenteropathies (17) ; however, cats with increased fPL levels were excluded from this study. Carbohydrate malabsorption was previously reported in cats with IBD, but dietary carbohydrates were not shown to negatively impact clinical signs (18) . The higher dietary carbohydrate content of Diet A, relative to Diet B, did not appear to negatively impact diet performance and was well tolerated.

In addition to total dietary fat, the fatty acid composition should also be considered. Based on the guaranteed analysis for total omega-3 fatty acids and inclusion of fish oil ( Table 1) , Diet A was expected to provide greater concentrations of long-chain omega-3 fatty acid. Dietary long-chain omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to modulate inflammation within the body, providing benefit to a variety of inflammatory medical conditions (19) . The underlying etiology was not defined in this study; however, IBD is commonly reported in feline gastroenteropathy, and the use of omega-3 fatty acids may have a beneficial effect in modulating the inflammatory response (19) . While the duration of this study was relatively short, fatty acid incorporation into intestinal tissues can occur fairly rapidly, with one study showing significantly higher concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in human colonic tissue following 7 days of supplementation compared to controls (20) . Additional studies evaluating diets with titrated levels of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids are required to better understand potential benefits in cats with chronic gastroenteropathy.

Finally, differences in dietary fiber and prebiotic ingredients may have influenced response. Crude fiber analysis was 2.22% in Diet A and 3.16% in Diet B. Total dietary fiber and the soluble and insoluble fractions were not analyzed in this study. These data would have helped to better characterize the dietary fiber composition of the diets; however, ingredient composition provides some insight as to how these two diets differ. Diet A utilized dried beet pulp, fructooligosaccharides, and mannanoligosaccharides, while Diet B utilized powdered cellulose followed by dried beet pulp. Based on the ingredient composition, Diet A would be expected to provide more fermentable fibers and prebiotics that may have promoted an increased production of total intraluminal short-chain fatty acids and positively influenced microbial populations (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) . While dietary fiber and prebiotics are generally considered to provide benefits primarily within the large intestine and aid in the management of diarrhea, recent studies have demonstrated immune modulating benefits that could have broader benefits, particularly in conditions with an inflammatory nature (31, 32) . The time required to see potential clinical benefits is unclear, and clinical improvement related to immunomodulation may require more than 1-2 weeks of dietary intervention. Additional studies are needed to better understand the role of the microbiota in inflammatory gastrointestinal disease and the potential benefits of dietary fibers and prebiotics in animals with chronic gastroenteropathies.

There were several limitations to this study, including the relatively small study population that was below the initial target of 25 cats per treatment group. Additional numbers may have been required to demonstrate a significant difference in Diet B and between the two dietary interventions. This study also relied on a comparison to baseline versus a comparison to a non-therapeutic control formula. A non-therapeutic control would have been ideal for establishing effectiveness of the therapeutic diets; however, due to ethical considerations, all study participants were provided with a therapeutic dietary intervention. Additionally, this study relied on the owner's recall to establish the baseline weekly vomiting frequency. A recorded baseline would have been preferred; however, it was decided that it was not in the cats' best interest to delay dietary intervention. Finally, the lack of significance may have been influenced by the variability of clinical disease within individual cats. It was appreciated in this study that while most cats had a progressive decline of vomiting occurrences, some cats had episodic occurrences of vomiting that varied from week to week (Figure 1 ). The 4-week feeding period was chosen to approximate a reasonable duration for a dietary trial with a gastrointestinal therapeutic formula before additional diagnostic procedures and/or medical treatments would be employed to better characterize and manage the underlying disease. While this study did not follow the cats beyond the 4-week period, it would have been optimal to evaluate this cohort for 4-6 months to identify whether there were recrudescence of clinical signs and any differences between the two diet groups long term.

cOnclUsiOn Results of this study suggest that gastrointestinal therapeutic diets alone can be effective in the management of cats with chronic vomiting associated with a chronic gastroenteropathy. Cats that do not respond to dietary therapy require further diagnostics and/or medical therapy to adequately characterize and manage the underlying disease. Additionally, cats that do not respond to gastrointestinal formulas may respond to diets formulated with limited novel ingredients or hydrolyzed protein sources.

This study was carried out in accordance with the P&G Pet Care Animal Research Policy, and the protocol was approved by the P&G Pet Care Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All cat owners provided written consent to participate in the study.

A Nucleic-Acid Hydrolyzing Single Chain Antibody Confers Resistance to DNA Virus Infection in HeLa Cells and C57BL/6 Mice

Viral protein neutralizing antibodies have been developed but they are limited only to the targeted virus and are often susceptible to antigenic drift. Here, we present an alternative strategy for creating virus-resistant cells and animals by ectopic expression of a nucleic acid hydrolyzing catalytic 3D8 single chain variable fragment (scFv), which has both DNase and RNase activities. HeLa cells (SCH7072) expressing 3D8 scFv acquired significant resistance to DNA viruses. Virus challenging with Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in 3D8 scFv transgenic cells and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay based on direct DNA cleavage analysis revealed that the induced resistance in HeLa cells was acquired by the nucleic acid hydrolyzing catalytic activity of 3D8 scFv. In addition, pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection in WT C57BL/6 mice was lethal, whereas transgenic mice (STG90) that expressed high levels of 3D8 scFv mRNA in liver, muscle, and brain showed a 56% survival rate 5 days after PRV intramuscular infection. The antiviral effects against DNA viruses conferred by 3D8 scFv expression in HeLa cells as well as an in vivo mouse system can be attributed to the nuclease activity that inhibits viral genome DNA replication in the nucleus and/or viral mRNA translation in the cytoplasm. Our results demonstrate that the nucleic-acid hydrolyzing activity of 3D8 scFv confers viral resistance to DNA viruses in vitro in HeLa cells and in an in vivo mouse system.

Viruses are pathogenic agents that cause potentially devastating diseases such as the flu, hepatitis, poliomyelitis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza, and foot-and-mouse disease [1, 2, 3] . Many antiviral drug studies have been based on a functional analysis of viral genes and an understanding of the virus life cycle. McFarland and Hill (1987) showed successful vaccination of mice and pigs with a mutant PRV thymidine kinase [4] . Qing Ge also demonstrated that nucleocapsid siRNA or a component of the RNA transcriptase (PA) is a good antiviral drug to protect against influenza virus by inhibiting viral RNA transcription with siRNAs [5] . In addition, acyclovir, which is the best antiviral agent against HSV-1, is a nucleotide analogue that shows an antiviral effect by inhibiting DNA replication [6] . However, commercially-developed antiviral drugs such as viral DNA polymerases, viral reverse transcriptases, and neuraminidase inhibitors target one or two viruses [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] . Thus, a new strategy is needed to prepare for outbreaks caused by new viruses or new mutant viruses because of the high mutation rates of viral genomes and recombination events among closely-related viruses [12, 13] .

A scFv is a recombinant antibody fragment, which commonly consists of a full variable region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain covalently linked to the corresponding variable region of an immunoglobulin light chain. scFvs have multiple benefits over traditional monoclonal antibodies due to their greatly reduced size, ease of genetic manipulation, and production of antibodies against viral proteins [14] . In 1994, scFv which binds to the Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) regulatory protein Rev was expressed intracellularly and potently inhibited HIV-1 replication in scFv immunized cells [15] . In addition, scFv against HIV integrase and reverse transcriptase showed reduced viral progeny in virus infected cells [16, 17] . The retroviral capsid protein can be used as an antiviral target and thereby extend the number of targets that can potentially be used in combined scFvbased gene therapy approaches [18] . However, despite the many virus resistant studies using scFv proteins, no reports are available about scFv having an antiviral effect against a broad spectrum of viruses. Montandon et al. (1982) showed antiviral effects against Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) with DNase I. In another study, DNase I digested DNA in the form of unmethylated proviral M-MuLV selectively [19] . Exonuclease, ISG20, which is induced by type 1 interferon (IFN), was over-expressed in CEL cells to inhibit HIV replication through nuclease activity [20, 21] . Another case was reported in a plant system using Pac1, an RNase isolated from the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Challenging a transgenic potato that expresses Pac1 with potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) resulted in suppression of PSTVd infection and accumulation without significant undesired effects on the plant. The anti-viral effects of these RNases depend on their RNAhydrolyzing activity [22] .

We have shown previously that the 3D8 scFv protein has nuclease activity that non-specifically degrades in vitro DNA and RNA substrates [23] . 3D8 scFv originated from MRL mice and is a recombinant single chain antibody linked to VH and VL by linker peptides [14] . 3D8 scFv has catalytic activity supporting the hydrolysis of both single stranded and double stranded DNAs in the presence of Mg 2+ without significant sequence specificity. In addition, efficient degradation of RNAs by 3D8 scFv in the presence of EDTA demonstrates that 3D8 scFv does not need divalent metal ions for its RNase activity [23] . Additionally, 3D8 scFv has DNase and RNase activity but when the active sites of each VL and VH are changed from histidine (35 position in VH and 94 position in VL) to alanine, respectively, by site-directed mutagenesis, the mutant 3D8 scFv loses DNase activity but retains RNase activity [24] . We previously showed that 3D8 scFv can be applied to protect PK15 cells from virus infection. PK15 cells harboring 3D8 scFv show resistance to classical swine fever virus (CSFV) through RNase activity [25] . Also, we previously found that progenies of the transgenic tobacco plant acquired complete resistances against two single stranded (ss)-DNA geminiviruses, four ssRNA tobamoviruses, and one ssRNA cucumovirus [26, 27] . So far, chemicals or specific antibodies for viral proteins have been mostly used in antiviral agents. But, 3D8 scFv with a completely different mechanism than antiviral agents is expected to be effective against a broad spectrum of viral infections.

We established in vitro cell and in vivo mouse systems harboring 3D8 scFv genes and antiviral mechanism against PRV and HSV as DNA viruses with dsDNA genomes. The expression patterns of viral open reading frames (ORFs) were identified and the FRET assay and confocal microscopy were performed to investigate the antiviral mechanism shown in our experimental in vitro and in vivo systems. Taken together, our data support that the antiviral effect against the DNA virus used in this work was caused by (1) nuclear DNase activity that inhibited DNA replication or RNA transcription and (2) RNase activity in the cytoplasm blocked protein translation.

The 3D8 scFv cell line expresses 3D8 proteins in both the cytosol and nucleus

The gene encoding 3D8 scFv was introduced into HeLa cells to test whether 3D8 scFv expressing cell lines could protect against DNA virus (HSV-1 and PRV) infection. The DNAs coding for both the wild-type 3D8 scFv protein (SCH) and the inactive DNase-mutated 3D8 scFv protein (muSCH) were cloned under the transcriptional dependence of the cytomegalovirus promoter in the pcDNA3.1/V5-HisB vector ( Figure 1A ). Three 3D8 scFv lines (SCH07041, SCH07071, and SCH07072) and mutated 3D8 scFv (muSCH) were selected by serial dilution in media containing G418 [28] . We evaluated 3D8 scFv expression levels in selected cell lines by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), flow cytometric analysis, and immunocytochemistry. According to quantitative real-time RT-PCR, SCH07072 expressed the highest 3D8 scFv RNA compared to that of the other two cell lines (1.3 and 4 times more). The mutant 3D8 scFv-transfected (muSCH) cells expressed similar levels of 3D8 scFv RNA to SCH07072 ( Figure 1B) . Flow cytometry data revealed that when the mean for the HeLa cell line as a control was 79.48, SCH07041, SCH07071, and SCH07072 were 88.45, 109.17, and 126.38, respectively (Geo mean: HeLa = 74.51, SCH07041 = 76.88, SCH07071 = 89.89, and SCH07072 = 115.33) and was similar to the results shown in the quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis ( Figure 1C ). Confocal microscopy demonstrated that 3D8 scFv proteins in SCH07072 and muSCH were targeted and localized in both the cytosol and nucleus ( Figure 1D ). Common features of anti-DNA antibodies that have a large number of positively-charged residues within complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of VH or VL domains due to their antigen binding properties, which resemble the nuclear localization signal (NLS), have been attributed to their final accumulation within the nucleus of cells, such as cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) [29] . Therefore, 3D8 scFv proteins were localized in the cytosol using a vector system and targeted to the nucleus by a NLS.

3D8 scFv exhibits resistance to HSV type1 and PRV in stably transfected cell lines

The three 3D8 scFv lines and the one mutant 3D8 scFv line were challenged with HSV-1::GFP and PRV which had dsDNA as a genome. Virus-infected HeLa cells express GFP in the cytoplasm after HSV infection [30] and PRV infection results in cytopathic effects (CPE) in HeLa cells. In addition, PRV results in multinuclear giant cell formation as a PRV CPE [31] .

GFP expression levels in the four cell lines challenged with three different MOI (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0) of HSV::GFP were observed under a fluorescence microscope 48 hours after virus challenge. The SCH07072 line showed the lowest GFP expression compared to that of the other two lines (SCH07041 and SCH07071) and the

Most strategies for developing virus-resistant transgenic cells and animals are based on the concept of virusderived resistance, in which dysfunctional virus-derived products are expressed to interfere with the pathogenic process of the virus in transgenic cells or animals. However, these viral protein targeting approaches are limited because they only target specific viruses and are susceptible to viral mutations. We describe a novel strategy that targets the viral genome itself, rather than viral gene products, to generate virus-resistant transgenic cells and animals. We functionally expressed 3D8 scFv which has both DNase and RNase activities, in HeLa cells and transgenic mice. We found that the transgenic cells and mice acquired complete resistance to two DNA viruses (HSV and PRV) without accumulating the virus, and showed delayed onset of disease symptoms. The antiviral effects against DNA viruses demonstrated in this study were caused by (1) DNase activity of 3D8 scFv in the nucleus, which inhibited DNA replication or RNA transcription and (2) 3D8 scFv RNase activity in the cytoplasm, which blocked protein translation. This strategy may facilitate control of a broad spectrum of viruses, including viruses uncharacterized at the molecular level, regardless of their genome type or variations in gene products. mutant line (muSCH) (Figure 2A) . The plaque assay revealed that SCH07072 cells produced the fewest number of viral progeny of 163/ml at an MOI of 0.1 and 530/ml at an MOI of 0.5. The plaque assay data supported the GFP expression results showing the best antiviral effects among the three cell lines. In contrast to SCH07072, wild-type HeLa cells had 1,343/ml (8.24 times higher) and 7,851/ml (14.81 times higher) viral progeny at MOIs of 0.1 and 0.5, respectively ( Figure 2B ). At an MOI of 0.5, muSCH cells produced a viral titer that was 14.42 times higher than that of SCH07072 and was similar to that of wild type HeLa cells ( Figure 2B ). Western blot analysis using an anti-HSV DNA polymerase antibody (POL/UL42 complex) demonstrated that less HSV-1 DNA polymerase was detected in SCH07072 cells compared to that of wild-type HeLa cell lines 48 hours after virus challenge ( Figure 2C ).

Similar to HSV, PRV also showed similar antiviral effects in the three 3D8 scFv cell lines and one mutant cell line. Forty-eight hours after the PRV challenge, fewer cytopathic effects, as assessed by multinuclear giant cell formation, were observed in SCH07072 cells compared to the other types of cells, including wild-type cells ( Figure 3A) . The plaque assay also showed the highest antiviral effects in SCH07072 cells with viral titers of 916/ml and 7,466/ml at MOIs of 0.1 and 0.5, respectively, compared to those of wildtype HeLa cells (9,130/ml and 31,833/ml, respectively) and the muSCH cell line (9.046/ml and 30,400/ml, respectively ( Figure 3B ). The expression levels of 3D8 scFv in SCH07071 and SCH07072 cells were similar ( Figure 1B ) but the antiviral activity of SCH07072 and SCH07071 were quite different. Generally there is a correlation between 3D8 scFv expression and antiviral activity. However, in order for cells to acquire the antiviral activity of 3D8 scFv, a certain amount of 3D8 scFv protein needs to be expressed. We thought that there might be a threshold for the acquired antiviral activity conferred by 3D8 scFv expression. SCH07072 may have reached the threshold but SCH07071 did not ( Figure 3B ). Glycoprotein D (gpD) was used for Western analysis to count the PRV. The gpD protein was not found in the SCH07072 lines but wild-type HeLa cells showed strong signals ( Figure 3C ). Even though the expression level of 3D8 scFv in SCH07041 cells was significantly lower (approx. 1/3) than that of SCH07072 cells, both cells were found to be equally resistant against HSV-1 infection at an MOI of 0.1 ( Figure 2B) , suggesting that the 3D8 scFv protein level in SCH07041 cells was close to the maximum effective dose against HSV-1. At a higher virus titer (MOI 0.5), the antiviral effect of 3D8 scFv was shown in a more dose-dependent manner such that much less viral infectivity was found in the SCH07072 cells than the SCH07041 (1,964.00 vs 530.67 pfu/ml). This was further demonstrated in case of PRV infection study ( Figure 3B ), in which the SCH07072 cells were shown to be more resistant against the virus infection than the SCH07041 cells at both MOI of 0.1 and 0.5. As a result, 3D8 scFv expression levels and antiviral effects showed a directly proportional relationship. 3D8 scFv expression levels were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in transgenic cell lines. The relative concentrations of 3D8 scFv were calculated after normalization to the GAPDH gene using the delta delta C T method. Data bars represent mean 6 standard error. The expression levels of each cell line were compared to SCH07072. C. Identification of three 3D8 scFv cell lines (SCH07041, SCH07071, and SCH07072) by flow cytometry. Transgenic and wild-type HeLa cells were stained with 3D8 scFv Ab and TRITC-anti-rabbit Ig for flow cytometry. D. Localization of 3D8 scFv in transgenic and wild-type HeLa cells by immunocytochemistry. Nuclei were detected by DAPI staining (blue). 3D8 scFv expression was monitored by immunofluorescence using a polyclonal anti-3D8 scFv antibody that was visualized with TRITC (Rhodamine Red). 3D8 scFv proteins were localized in both the cytosol and nucleus of SCH07072 and muSCH cells. doi: 10 

The FRET assay was carried out to confirm that 3D8 scFv nuclease activity was responsible for the antiviral activity shown by SCH07072 cells [32] (Figure 4 ). SCH07072 cells produced up to 660 relative fluorescence units (RFU) 80 min after the 6carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labeled DNA substrate was introduced into the cells. However, the fluorescence output from HeLa cells, muSCH cells, and the negative control reactant was a maximum of 200 RFU or less ( Figure 4A ). When the FAM-labeled RNA substrate was introduced into cells, SCH07072 and muSCH cells had fluorescence levels of about 200 RFU, but HeLa cells and the negative control reactant showed fluorescence levels of only 80 RFU ( Figure 4B ). These FRET results confirmed that 3D8 scFv in SCH07072 had both DNase and RNase activity, but that only RNase activity was observed in muSCH cells ( Figure 4) . Therefore, the protection against the virus infection shown by SCH07072 cells was due to 3D8 scFv nuclease activity against the virus genome itself.

Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to investigate how 3D8 scFv protected against virus infection in relation to the virus infection cycle. The amounts of viral DNA and RNA isolated from cells grown with or without HSV DNA polymerase inhibitor (Phosphonoacetic acid, PAA) in the culture media were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR ( Figure 5 ). PAA inhibited the synthesis of HSV DNA in infected cells and the activity of the virus-specific DNA polymerase in vitro [33] . PAA was used to investigate the antiviral effects by 3D8 scFv DNase activity in the immediate early stage before de novo viral DNA replication. The changes in viral DNA content in HeLa, SCH07072, and muSCH cells were traced at immediate early (2 hr after virus challenge, ICP4), early (6.5 hr after virus challenge, UL9), and late (25 hr after virus challenge, UL19) stages of infection ( Figure 5A ). Viral DNA accumulation in SCH07072 cells was reduced by up to 94.2% under the PAA-untreated condition, compared to HeLa cells at each stage. Virus DNA accumulation in SCH07072 cells cultured with PAA decreased by up to 80% compared to that in HeLa cells at all stages of infection. In contrast, muSCH cells under the PAA-untreated condition showed as much virus DNA accumulation as HeLa cells at the early stage of infection, but 68% more viral DNA was detected in muSCH cells compared to HeLa cells at the late stage. The accumulation of virus DNA in SCH07072 indicates that nuclear 3D8 scFv can degrade viral DNA directly, resulting in less accumulation of viral DNA ( Figure 5B ).

Viral RNA expression was also analyzed under the same experimental conditions. Viral RNA accumulation of six ORFs decreased rapidly in PAA-treated cells at both the early and late stages of infection ( Figure 5C ). Only SCH07072 cells showed a 3D8 scFv Confers Resistance to DNA Virus Infection PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org substantial reduction in viral RNA accumulation during the entire infection cycle under the PAA-untreated condition compared to HeLa and muSCH cells. The expression of ICP0 and ICP4 in SCH07072 cells cultured with PAA decreased by 72.5% and 74.9%, respectively, compared to HeLa cells during the immediate early stage. At the late infection stage, SCH07072 cells expressed 83.1% and 87% less UL19 and UL 38 transcripts, respectively, than those of HeLa cells after virus challenge ( Figure 5C ). However, ICP0 and ICP4 levels were 69.4% and 60.7% lower than in HeLa cells during the immediate early stage of muSCH cell infection, and were similar to the viral RNA content seen in SCH07072 cells. However, at the late stage of infection, the viral RNA accumulation patterns in muSCH cells were similar to those in HeLa cells ( Figure 5C ).

The HSV-1 RNA transcription occurs during immediate early stage of the viral infection stage together with a limited level of its DNA replication, as summarized on Edward K. Wagner's web site (http://darwin.bio.uci.edu/,faculty/wagner/hsv4f.html). Therefore, in the absence of PAA the decreased level of viral DNA in muSCH cells in comparison with that of HeLa cells is likely to be attributed to an interference of HSV -1 transcription by the RNase activity of the mutant 3D8 scFv ( Figure 5B ). With treatment of PAA, a specific inhibitor of viral DNA polymerase, the level of viral DNA replication in muSCH and HeLa cells were shown to be almost identical at immediate early stage. This relatively mild impact of PAA on DNA replication in muSCH cells as compared with HeLa and SCH07072 cells was also observed when selected viral RNA transcripts were measured in these cells at immediate early stage ( Figure 5C ). Transcriptions of these genes were found to be significantly decreased in HeLa and SCH07072 cells upon PAA, which reflects the decreased level of viral DNA templates for transcription. By contrast, transcription level of these genes in muSCH cells at the same stage did not show any significant difference between PAA treated and untreated cells.

On entry into the nucleus, the genome of HSV-1 is also associated rapidly with histone proteins [34] and nucleosomes are assembled, though in irregularly or randomly spaced manners, on 1 hour post infection. Therefore, it is intriguing and difficult to explain on why and how only the viral genome is subjected to the nucleic acid hydrolyzing activity of 3D8 scFv, leaving host genome largely unaffected. Perhaps as the HSV-1 genome, which was not completely assembled with nucleosomes or was assembled with unstable nucleosomes, can be digested by intrinsic DNase of 3D8 scFv during HSV-1 replication takes place (6 hours post infection or early stage), especially considering that the viral genome is found to be relatively free of histones following viral DNA replication, beyond 6 hours post infection [35] . When we compared the HSV-1 DNA accumulation between SCH07072 and muSCH cells on immediate early stage, early stage and late stage respectively, muSCH cells showed limited antiviral activities at immediate early stage but did not show any antiviral activity later on. Thus it may indicates that mutant 3D8 scFv with only intrinsic RNase activity is not sufficient for providing a full protection for host cells against HSV-1 infection once HSV-1 DNA replication successfully takes places in nucleus in muSCH cells. Therefore, it may be possible that the antiviral effects of 3D8 scFv against HSV-1 and PRV infection were contributed by both the DNase activity, which is mainly effective in the nucleus and the RNase activity mainly effective in the cytoplasm. This proposed antiviral activity can be explained by (1) temporal blockage of viral DNA replication in the nucleus and protein translation in the cytosol and (2) spatial protection (nucleus vs. cytosol) provided by 3D8 scFv. However, further experimental investigations are needed to confirm the antiviral mechanisms of 3D8 scFv proposed in this study.

The 3D8 scFv protein shown in SCH07072 was localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus ( Figure 1D ). To test our hypothesis that 3D8 scFv acted as a DNase in the nucleus, we investigated whether 3D8 scFv could hydrolyze histone-bound DNA and methylated DNA. Both 3D8 scFv and DNase I at 10610 24 U/ml started to hydrolyze 0.2 mg DNA 1 hr after treatment. At a concentration of 8.3610 24 U/ml, 3D8 scFv digested more non-methylated DNA than methylated DNA after 1 hr of treatment ( Figure 6A ). In addition, quantitation of nonmethylated and methylated DNA showed a reduction rate of 62% and 21%, respectively ( Figure 6C) . However, no difference in hydrolysis of non-methylated and methylated DNA was observed when 8.3610 24 U/ml DNase I was tested ( Figure 6A ). Both 3D8 scFv and DNase I did not digest DNA at a concentration of 1.4610 24 U/ml, regardless of whether it was methylated or not ( Figure 6A ). We next tested whether the 3D8 scFv protein could digest histone-bound DNA in the nucleus. Histone-bound DNA fragments (150 bp) were not hydrolyzed by either 3D8 scFv or DNase I at concentrations of 10610 24 U/ml and 8.3610 24 U/ml, as shown in Figure 6B . But, at concentrations of 8.3610 24 U/ml 3D8 scFv, DNA without histones was reduced 34% and 90% after 1 hr and 3 hr, respectively ( Figure 6C) . Also, 3D8 scFv digested more DNA without histones than DNase I at concentrations of 8.3610 24 U/ml 1 hr after treatment ( Figure 6B ).

The nuclear DNA of eukaryotic cells is mostly modified by methylation and interacts with various nuclear proteins such as histone proteins [36, 37, 38, 39] . Figure 6 shows that 3D8 scFv did not hydrolyze methylated or histone-bound DNA when the activity of 3D8 scFv was ,1.4610 24 U/ml. This result indicates that chromosomal DNA in the nucleus was protected from 3D8 scFv because chromosomal DNA is mostly methylated and histone-bound., 3D8 scFv proteins in SCH07072 cells are expressed at lower working concentrations than we tested in our in vitro analysis shown in Figure 6 .

HeLa, SCH07072, and muSCH cells showed similar doubling patterns when 72 hr growth curves were plotted ( Figure S1A ). Northern blot analysis showed that the RNA stability and RNA expression patterns of three marker genes (GAPDH, actin, and VEGF) in the three cell lines were not affected by expression of the 3D8 scFv protein ( Figure S1B ). Taken together, expression of the 3D8 scFv protein in SCH07072 cells did not affect cell growth or viability.

Pac1 and ISG20, which have RNase activity, have been used as antiviral proteins against potato spindle tuber viroid and HIV, respectively [21, 22] . Our observations and those of others on the effects of exogenous expression of RNase (Pac1 and ISG20) and/ or nuclease (3D8 scFv) indicate that it is possible to develop transgenic plants and animal cells and even entire organisms that are virus-resistant. However, host RNA could be degraded nonselectively by 3D8 scFv RNase activity in 3D8 scFv-expressing cells. During the transformation process, antiviral transgenic cell lines or organisms can be developed if (1) the amount of 3D8 scFv protein expressed does not inhibit the physiological and developmental processes of cells or organisms, and (2) the amount of 3D8 scFv protein produced is sufficient to protect against virus infection.

3D8 scFv and DNase I were transferred to HeLa cells using a microporator to investigate cell viability using a neutral red assay. The concentration of each protein was adjusted to be 1.5625610 23 [19] . However, when we introduced the same unit amounts of DNase I and 3D8 scFv into HeLa cells using a microporator, the antiviral effects of the 3D8 scFv protein were almost 8-fold higher than those of DNase I ( Figure S2C ). This result indicates that 3D8 scFv has a greater antiviral effect than DNase I, most likely due to the additional RNase activity of 3D8 scFv ( Figure S2 ).

After the antiviral effects of the 3D8 scFv protein was confirmed in HeLa cells, transformed mice harboring the 3D8 scFv gene were produced to investigate the antiviral effects in an in vivo mouse system. The pcDNA3.1-3D8 scFv plasmid was linearized with NruI/StuI/PvuI enzymes and then used for transformation of C57BL/6NCrjBgi. A total of 150 F 0 were generated and 10 lines (F 0 : 47, 69, 90, 92, 108, 109, 110, 115, 128, and 135 ) out of 150 F 0 were selected by PCR analysis ( Figure S3A ). Each transformant was reconfirmed by Southern hybridization after genomic DNA was digested by EcoRI and HindIII enzymes. All transformants showed single bands that reacted with the probes prepared with the 3D8 scFv full gene ( Figure S3B ). 3D8 scFv expression levels were analyzed in the different transgenic lines and different organs. The muscle, brain, and liver were chosen because these organs are virus infection routes and the relative 3D8 scFv gene expression levels were investigated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR ( Figure 7A ). The F 0 69, 90, and 135 lines were selected from 10 F 0 lines for further analysis based on 3D8 scFv expression levels in the TG mice lines and previous therapeutics experiments, which showed that PRV was detected in muscle and brains after mice were challenged with PRV and 3D8 scFv proteins by intramuscular and intraperitoneal injections, respectively. Therefore, the F 0 90 line, which expressed the highest 3D8 scFv levels in both brain Wild-type HeLa, SCH07072, and muSCH cells were infected with HSV::GFV at an MOI of 0.5 and then incubated for 2, 6.5, and 25 hr in the presence or absence of PAA 1 hr after virus challenge. ICP4 was used for the immediate early stage, UL9 for the early stage, and UL19 for the late stage of viral infection. Data bars show mean 6 standard error. ** and *** indicate significant differences from HSV-1 viral DNA at p,0.01 and p,0.001, respectively (one-way analysis of variance and Tukey's post hoc t-test). C. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to measure the expression of immediate early genes (ICP0 and ICP4), early genes (UL9 and UL29), and late genes (UL19 and UL38). The relative concentrations of HSV mRNAs were calculated after normalization to the GAPDH gene using the delta delta C T method. Data bars represent mean 6 standard error. *, **, *** indicate significant differences from HeLa cells at p,0.05, p,0.01, and p,0.001, respectively (one-way analysis of variance and Tukey's post hoc t-test and muscle, and the F 0 135 line, which expressed high amounts of 3D8 scFv in the brain, were selected and used for further investigations on the antiviral preventive effects. The F 0 69 line showed positive gPCR and RT-PCR results but 3D8 scFv expression levels in the F 0 69 line were low; thus, it was used as a control.

On the basis of the expression levels in the F 0 69 line, the F 0 90 line produced 12.25 times more 3D8 scFv in the liver and the F 0 110 and F 0 135 lines showed 0.29 and 0.07 times less than that of the F 0 69 line. However, the F 0 90 and F 0 135 lines had 3,270 and 3,174 times more 3D8 scFv in the brain than that of the F 0 69 line, even 201.98 times more in F 0 110. Therefore, the F 0 69 line was used as a control and the F 0 90 and F 0 135 lines were used for testing the antiviral preventive effects in TG mice lines after PRV infection ( Figure 7A) .

The 3D8 scFv TG founder (F 0 lines) was mated with wild-type C57BL/6NCrjBgi to establish the lines and produce siblings from the F 0 lines. Four F 1 lines (69 F 1 : 31, 33, 38, 208) were produced from the F 0 69 lines. Each of the four F 1 69 lines were mated with wild-type C57BL/6NCrjBgi and then 20 F 2 69 lines were produced. They were used for virus challenge experiments and named STG69. In the case of the 90 and 135 F 1 lines, three F 1 90 lines (F 1 90: 45, 46, and 162) and five F 1 135 lines (F 1 135: 140, 142,   144 , 165, and 166) were produced and then 17 F 2 90 lines (STG90) and 24 F 2 135 lines (STG135) were prepared ( Figure S4A ). Genomic PCR was performed to confirm the transgenic lines at each generation from F 0 to F 2 (data not shown).

The number of live and dead mice was counted every 12 hr for 5 days to investigate the viability in each TG line after the femoral muscle was challenged with 10 LD 50 PRV was ( Figure S4B) . Figure 7B shows that the viability of WT mice challenged with PRV was 11% (2/18). The viabilities of the STG69 and STG135 lines against PRV challenges were about 40% (8/20) and 17% (4/24), respectively. However, the STG90 line showed 53% (9/17) viability. These data were described by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Mice generally began to exhibit clinical signs of illness 3-5 days post-challenge ( Figure 7C) .

RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were performed to confirm virus accumulation in the three 3D8 scFv TG lines after PRV inoculation. Figure 8A shows that PRV gpD RNA was detected in the muscle and brain of WT, STG69, and STG135 mice accompanied by disease symptoms. Immunohistochemical analysis with an anti-gpD antibody supported the viral gene expression data; only WT mice with a high infection rate had Purkinje layer cells from the brain that stained dark brown after diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining ( Figure 8B) .

These data indicate that virus multiplication was not inhibited by the 3D8 scFv protein if virus infection was not protected against in the early infection stages by the 3D8 scFv protein. This also indicates that PRV DNA was hydrolyzed immediately in virusinoculated STG90 muscle cells, and that the virus titer was not high enough to infect muscle cells. Therefore, PRV could not move systemically into the spinal cord or brain in STG90 mice. However, STG135 mice were not protected against PRV infection even though 3D8 scFv protein was expressed in the brain ( Figure 7A ) at similar levels to those observed in STG90 mice. We interpret these data to indicate that the expression and presence of antiviral proteins in inoculated cells and tissues is as important as high expression levels in target cells or tissues. Blood biochemistry ( Table 1 ) and body weight changes for 7 weeks after birth ( Figure S5A and S5B) were not significantly different between STG90 and WT mice. Also, we identified the expression patterns of endogenous genes including apoptosis (K-ras and BAX), growth factor (VEGF), and housekeeping (GAPDH) genes between STG90 and wild-type mice; however, there was no difference ( Figure S5C ).

Although we have demonstrated the antiviral effect attributed by DNase and RNase activity of 3D8 scFv without any cytotoxic effect on the host cells in this study ( Figure S1A and S1B) , possibility of the host DNAs damaged by non-specific nuclease activity of 3D8 scFv cannot be entirely ruled out. In our previous study, when we tested the potential cytotoxic effect of 3D8 scFv on HeLa cells with varying concentration of 3D8 scFv (5-40 mM) for 48 hrs, the cell viability was found to drop by ,50-60% upon 10 mM of 3D8 scFv treatment, while treatment of the cells with 1 mM and 5 mM 3D8 scFv exhibited no significant cytotoxicity up to 48 h of incubation (0 and ,20% respectively) [40] . This may indicate that the host cells indeed begin to be affected by the Figure 7 . High expression of 3D8 scFv in the muscle and brain of STG90 mice. A. 3D8 scFv mRNA expression was verified by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis in the muscle and brain of TG mice. The STG90 line expressed high levels of 3D8 scFv in both the brain and muscle, whereas the STG135 line expressed high amounts of 3D8 scFv in the brain; these strains were selected for further antiviral preventive studies. The relative expression of 3D8 scFv mRNAs was calculated after normalization to the GAPDH gene using the delta delta C T method. The primer efficiency of 3D8 scFv and GAPDH are 1.845 and 2.065, respectively. Each qRT-PCR data point is a representative example of data from three replicate experiments. Data bars represent mean 6 standard error. B. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for antiviral effects of all groups. The difference in survival between WT-PRV and STG90-PRV was statistically significant (p = 0.0042 by log-rank test). The numbers of live and dead mice were counted every 12 hr for 5 days after challenge with 10 LD 50 PRV in the femoral muscle. Survival was highest in the STG90-PRV group (53%) compared to that of the other groups (WT-PRV: 11%, STG69: 40%, and STG135: 17%). C. PRV-challenged F 2 mice (WT-PRV) began to exhibit symptoms of inflammation in the femoral muscle and finally died 3-5 days post-virus challenge. Red arrow points to inflammation symptoms. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004208.g007 non-specific activity of 3D8 scFv at higher dosages (i.e., 5 mM and up). Although it is not clear on exactly how much 3D8 scFv protein actually penetrated into the cells from media when 5 mM 3D8 scFv protein was administered, 5 mM 3D8 scFv is fairly large amount of proteins for in vitro cytotoxicity analysis even though we used the same amount of the proteins for in vivo survival experiments with mice ( Figure 7) . On the other hand, the actual level of 3D8 scFv expressed in transgenic cells such as in SCH07072 cell line was too low to be even detected by Western blot analysis, although its expression was confirmed by confocal microscopic observation and flow cytometry analysis ( Figure 1) . Therefore, it can be concluded that the low concentration of 3D8 scFv expressed in transgenic cell lines or TG mice is generally sufficient for conferring antiviral effects without incurring damage to the host DNA, but the likelihood of 3D8 scFv having deleterious impact on host cells as well through non-specific nucleic acid hydrolyzing activity remains valid, especially at higher concentration of the protein.

In conclusion, the DNA virus-protective effects conferred by the 3D8 scFv protein can be attributed to the DNase activity of the protein in the nucleus and RNase activity in the cytoplasm. This antibody inhibits (1) viral DNA replication and RNA transcription in the nucleus by viral DNA degradation and (2) viral protein translation in the cytoplasm via viral RNA degradation. In other words, the 3D8 scFv protein attacks the virus DNA genome itself or its RNA transcripts in two different subcellular spaces (nucleus and cytoplasm) and at two different times (viral replication and viral transcription) (Figure 9 ). These antiviral effects of 3D8 scFv have not only been observed against viruses with a dsDNA genome but also ssRNA viruses such as CSFV [25] and several plant viruses such as geminivirus, tobamovirus, and cucumovirus [26, 27] . Taken together, 3D8 scFv is a candidate antiviral protein that can potentially confer resistance to a broad spectrum of animal and plant viruses.

HeLa cells were provided by the Korean Cell Line Bank and were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA), 100 U/ml penicillinstreptomycin (Hyclone), and non-essential amino acids (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), at 37uC in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. HSV-GFP virus was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC Number: VR-1544). The PRV-YS strain was obtained from the National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service (NVRQS) of Korea.

Anti-3D8 scFv polyclonal antibody was provided by Dr. Kwon (Ajou University School of Medicine). Anti-PRV gD monoclonal antibody was purchased from Jeno Biotech Inc. (Chuncheon, Korea) and anti-HSV monoclonal antibody was obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA, USA). Anti-GAPDH polyclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Establishment of 3D8 scFv-and mu3D8 scFv-expressing HeLa cell lines 3D8 scFv and mu3D8 scFv were amplified by PCR from the pIg20-3D8 scFv vector [23] and then subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 V5/His-B vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). pcDNA3.1-3D8 scFv and pcDNA3.1-mu3D8 scFv were transfected into HeLa cells using Fugene HD transfection reagents (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and selected by G418 selection (400 mg/ ml). The relative concentrations of 3D8 scFv and mu3D8 scFv were calculated by quantitative real-time PCR after normalization to the GAPDH gene (Table 2. ). The primer efficiency of 3D8 scFv and GAPDH are 1.845 and 2.065, respectively.

Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry were performed as described previously [40] . Cells on coverslips were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized with Perm-buffer (1% BSA, 0.1% saponin, 0.1% sodium azide in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature (RT). After blocking with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 hr, 3D8 scFv-treated cells were incubated with rabbit anti-3D8 scFv Ab, followed by TRITC-anti-rabbit Ig. Nuclei were stained with DAPI during the last 10 min of incubation at RT. Cells on coverslips were mounted in Vectashield anti-fade mounting medium (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA), and observed with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser confocal microscope and analyzed with Carl Zeiss LSM Image software (Jena, Germany). 3D8 scFv-transfected cell lines were assessed by flow cytometry. HeLa cells grown in sixwell plates (1610 5 cells/well) were pre-incubated in serum-free DMEM for 30 min at 37uC and were either untreated or treated with each inhibitor for 30 min at 37uC before 3D8 scFv (10 mM) treatment. Cells suspended with trypsin were treated once more with 0.1% trypsin for 3 min at 37uC to wash off surface-bound proteins. After washing with ice-cold PBS once, cells were fixed and permeabilized as per the procedures described above. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS twice, labeled with anti-rabbit 3D8 scFv Ab, followed by TRITC-antirabbit Ab, and then analyzed using a FACS Calibur TM (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). A total of 1610 4 cells were analyzed for each test.

Quantification of HSV-1 DNA and RNA from cells of SCH07072, muSCH, and HeLa was carried out by harvesting the cells at 2 hours post infection (HPI) with HSV-1, 6.5 HPI, and 25 HPI for immediate early stage, early stage, and late stage, respectively as summarized in Figure 5A . RNA was isolated from cells and mouse tissues (liver, muscle, lung, and brain) using Corezol reagent (CoreBio System) [41] . cDNA was synthesized from 5 mg of total RNA using random hexamers and MMLV reverse transcriptase (SuperBio). All primers were designed using the Primer 3 program. The expression levels of immediate early genes [ICP0 (transcriptional transactivator) and ICP4 (regulatory protein)] [42, 43] , early genes [UL9 (replication origin binding) and UL29 (single-strand binding protein)] [44, 45] and late genes [UL19 (capsid protein) and UL38 (capsid assembly)] [46, 47] were analyzed by Rotor-Gene 3000 (Corbett Research, Sydney, Australia) ( 

Virus-infected HeLa cells and SCH07072 cells were lysed using Pro-prep (Intron, Daejeon, Korea). Cell lysates were analyzed by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a semi-dry method, incubated with primary antibody (1:500 dilution for cleaved caspase 3 and INF-beta and a 1:1000 dilution for PRV gD and HSV) for 12 hr at 4uC, and then incubated with goat anti-mouse or rabbit IgG-HRP conjugate (1:1000) for 1 hr at 37uC.

A 21 base-long ribo-oligonucleotide (500 nM) labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) at the 59 terminus and a black hole quencher (BHQ) at the 39 terminus were synthesized (59 FAM-CGATGAGTGCCATGGATATAC-BHQ 39), annealed to the non-labeled complementary ribo-oligonucleotide, and then delivered into cells in 96-black-well plates using Lipofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Immediately after changing the medium, the real-time fluorescence intensity of the cells was read for 2 hr in real time using a fluorescence analyzer at 5 min intervals (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).

Vero cells were cultured on 6-well plates (Nunc). Ten-fold serial dilution of the virus samples was prepared in serum-free DMEM media. Each dilution (100 ml) was used to infect Vero cells in duplicate. The virus was allowed to adsorb at 37uC for 1 hr. After 48 hr incubation, the Vero cells were rinsed twice with PBS and stained with crystal violet solution for 5 min. The plates were washed with ddH 2 O and the virus titer was calculated. This plaque analysis included four biological and three technical replicates. Each cell line was infected by virus four times and the numbers of plaques on Vero cells were counted three times, respectively, by using the culture media containing viruses. [48] . Prepared chromatin DNA and naked DNA were treated with 3D8 scFv and DNase I (10610 24 U/ml and 8.3610 24 U/ml, respectively). The DNA samples were harvested after 0, 1, 2, and 3 hr of incubation and then each DNA sample was analyzed on an agarose gel for abzyme analysis. The relative quantification of DNA was measured by the height values and performed using GeneSnap 7.09 software (SynGene, UK).

A neutral red (NR) cytotoxicity assay was performed to test cell viability after treatment with DNase I or 3D8 scFv. DNase I and 3D8 scFv at concentrations ranging from 1.5625610 23 units to 0.05 units were transferred to HeLa cells using a microporator (iNCYTO). Uptake of neutral red dye into intracellular acidic compartments was determined by measuring absorbance at 540 nm.

Production of 3D8 scFv transgenic (TG) mice 3D8 scFv transgenic mice were produced by Macrogen Co. using standard microinjection procedures. Briefly, fertilized mouse eggs were flushed from the oviducts of superovulated C57BL/ 6NCrjBgi mice, and male pronuclei were injected with a 2.6 kb fragment (4 ng/ml) of 3D8 scFv that had been obtained by digesting the pcDNA3.1/V5-His B (3D8 scFv) vector with NruI/ StuI/PvuI restriction enzymes. The injected eggs were reimplanted in the oviducts of pseudo-pregnant C57BL/6NCrjBgi recipient females. At 3 weeks of age, the animals were tested for the presence of the transgene by PCR analysis of their genomic DNA using forward (59 CAGAGCTCTCTGGCTAACTAG 39) and reverse primers (59 CTGTTGAACAGACTCTGACTG 39). The 3D8scFv TG founders (F 0 lines) were mated with wild-type C57BL/6NCrjBgi mice to establish the transgenic lines and produce siblings from the F 0 lines in a breeding program provided by Macrogen Co. The principles of laboratory animal care (NIH publication 85-23, revised 1986) were followed and all experiments were carried out under the guidelines of the NVRQS, Korea.

Southern blot hybridization was used to confirm integration and determine the copy number of the 3D8 scFv gene in the transgenic mice. Genomic DNA (20 mg) from each transformant was digested with EcoRI and HindIII restriction enzymes and then the DNA was separated on 1% agarose gels. 3D8 scFv-specific [ 32 P]-radiolabeled probes were prepared from the pcDNA3.1V5/HisB-3D8 scFv vector.

Three 3D8 scFv TG mouse lines and the wild-type C57BL/6 line were divided into five groups with or without PRV infection (WT-mock, WT-PRV, STG69-PRV, STG90-PRV, and STG135-PRV). Mice were challenged with PRV by intramuscular injection (10 LD 50 ). Survival rates in each group were calculated at 12 hr intervals ( Figure S5 ). Tissues (muscle and brain) were harvested and stored at 270uC for further RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses.

Representative 3 mm-thick brain tissue sections for immunohistochemical analysis were mounted on silane-coated slides as described by Ramos-Vara [49] . Anti-PRV gpD antibody (Jeno Biotech Inc.) was used as the primary antibody (1:100) and was applied for 60 min at RT. The samples were then treated for color development with the DAB Detection Kit (Ventana Medical Systems, Germany). The viral envelope fuses with the cell membrane and delivers the viral capsid into the cytoplasm. Viral DNA synthesis begins shortly after the appearance of the beta proteins and the temporal program of viral gene expression ends with the appearance of the gamma or late proteins, which constitute the structural proteins of the virus. Finally, the virus undergoes a lytic cycle. B.

Blood collected from STG90 and wild-type mice was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min, and plasma was stored at 220uC until analysis. Plasma levels of total albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, and other total proteins were analyzed using an automatic blood chemistry analyzer (Selectra II, Merck, Germany).

All analyses were carried out using the GraphPAD Prism program (GraphPAD Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). A one-way analysis of variance and Tukey's post hoc t-test were used for statistical analyses. Data are presented as mean 6 SE. A p,0.05 was considered significant. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to compare survival against PRV infection. The statistical P value was generated between WT-PRV and STG90-PRV by the log-rank test. Figure S1 Expression of 3D8 scFv has no effect on cell growth or endogenous gene expression. A.

Acute Asthma in the Pediatric Emergency Department: Infections Are the Main Triggers of Exacerbations

Background. Asthma exacerbations are a common reason for Emergency Department (ED) visits in children. Aim. To analyze differences among age groups in terms of triggering factors and seasonality and to identify those with higher risk of severe exacerbations. Methods. We retrospectively revised the files of children admitted for acute asthma in 2016 in our Pediatric ED. Results. Visits for acute asthma were 603/23197 (2.6%). 76% of the patients were <6 years old and 24% ≥6. Infections were the main trigger of exacerbations in both groups; 33% of the school-aged children had a triggering allergic condition (versus 3% in <6 years; < .01). 191 patients had a previous history of asthma; among them, 95 were ≥6 years, 67% of whom were not using any controller medication, showing a higher risk of a moderate-to-severe exacerbation than those under long-term therapy ( < .01). Exacerbations peaked in autumn and winter in preschoolers and in spring and early autumn in the school-aged children.

Conclusions. Infections are the main trigger of acute asthma in children of any age, followed by allergy in the school-aged children. Efforts for an improved management of patients affected by chronic asthma might go through individualized action plans and possibly vaccinations and allergen-avoidance measures.

Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood. In Italy, it has been estimated that up to 9.5% of children aged 6-7 years and 10.4% of teenagers aged 13-14 years have ever been affected by this condition [1] . Acute asthma exacerbations are one of the most common reasons for presentation to the Emergency Department (ED) and for hospitalization in the pediatric age. In the United States, among asthmatic children nearly 60% have one or more acute exacerbations each year [2, 3] , and up to 20% require ED visits annually [4] . Moreover, asthmatic patients treated in the ED are at higher risk for future exacerbations and any single severe acute episode may progress to life-threatening respiratory failure [2, 5] .

Pediatric asthma has different patterns according to the children's age. In the preschoolers (0-5 years old), acute wheeze is often induced by infections of the lower airways, whereas in the school-aged children (6 years and older) it usually signifies underlying asthma [6] and allergy. These differences account for specific seasonal patterns in the number of ED visits for asthma. In the temperate latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, a peak in exacerbations is described in the month of September: this well-known entity is called the "September asthma epidemics," coincides with the start of the school year, and is likely due to a combination of infectious, allergic, environmental, and climatic triggers [7] . Understanding the seasonal variations of ED visits due to asthma may have important therapeutic implications in terms of a proactive treatment of at-risk subjects.

We performed a retrospective analysis of all the Pediatric ED visits for asthma in the past year in our hospital to analyze the differences among age groups in terms of triggering Table 1 : Classification of asthma severity according to the guidelines of the Italian Society of Pediatrics [8] . Normal values for respiratory rate: <2 months: <60 apm; 2-12 months: <50 apm; 1-5 yrs: <40 apm; 6-9 years: <30 apm; 10-14 yrs: <20 apm. Normal values for heart rate: 0-12 months: <160 bpm; 1-2 yrs: <120 bpm; 2-8 yrs: <110 bpm. Not all signs are needed for defining the severity of an exacerbation. apm: acts per minute; bpm: beats per minute; PEF: peak expiratory flow; FEV 1 : forced expiratory volume in the 1st second; SaO 2 : arterial oxygen saturation; PaCO 2 : partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood. factors and seasonality and to identify if there are any patients' groups which are more at risk of severe exacerbations and hospitalization.

We retrospectively revised all the files of children aged 0-14 years who were visited for acute asthma from 1 January to 31 December 2016 in the Pediatric ED of S. Orsola-Malpighi University Hospital of Bologna, Italy. All the patients with a diagnosis of "acute asthma," "wheezing bronchitis," and "bronchospasm" were included. Our center is an urban, academic, tertiary care Pediatric Emergency Unit, consisting of a Pediatric ED with approximately 23000 visits per year of children aged 0-14, a shortstay observation with 6 beds, and a ward with 28 beds. Patients arriving at the ED are registered by a triage-qualified nurse and seen first by pediatric residents and the attending physician. Two more nurses are available for the ED patients and 1 for the short-stay observation.

Triage acuity is defined by a 4-grade colour scale, white being the less urgent and red being the most. A white code means that the condition is not relevant or does not have an acute onset and is not affecting the vital signs; it can be reevaluated by the triage nurse if the symptoms modify and it might gain a higher priority. A green code indicates patients with normal vital signs but relevant, acute-onset symptoms; they should be reevaluated by the triage nurse every 30-60 minutes until medical evaluation. A yellow code is for those with severe lesions and altered vital signs that require rapid medical evaluation, so that these cases are closely communicated to the attending physician. A red code means that the condition is life-threatening (vital functions are compromised) and the patient requires immediate evaluation.

A Pediatric Intensive Care Unit is in the same building and intensivists' consultancies are available as needed.

For each patient presenting to the Pediatric ED, a record form is filled in by the nurse and medical staff, including demographic data, anamnestic information, vital signs, physical examination, treatment performed in the ER (if done), clinical reevaluation after treatment, diagnosis, discharge modality, and home therapy prescription when applicable. For children requiring a short-stay observation, prescribed examinations, therapy, and subsequent reevaluations are also noted on the same form.

The etiology of asthma exacerbations was considered as infectious if the episodes were concomitant to a respiratory tract illness documented by the clinical examination and/or laboratory or radiologic investigations; as allergic when there had been a clear exposition to a likely triggering allergen in a susceptible individual (known atopic or with a family history of allergic disease or with previous asthma episodes) and with no concomitant respiratory infection; as exerciseinduced when the exacerbation had been precipitated by physical activity; if no overt cause could be ascertained, the etiology was classified as "unknown."

The following data were considered for the study: age and sex of the patient, month of the visit, triage colour tag, acute asthma severity (see Table 1 ) [8] , etiology of the exacerbation, previous history of asthma or other chronic conditions (if reported), use of long-term control therapy for asthma, vital signs, presence and severity of dyspnea, severity of the exacerbation, administered therapy, and discharge modality (home, short-stay observation in the ED, and admission to the Pediatric Unit Ward or to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit).

The data were collected in a Microsoft Excel5 database. A descriptive analysis was performed for continuous variables (median, 25th and 75th percentiles). Data distribution was checked using MedCal Statistical Software (Version 17.4 MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium).

The associations between qualitative variables were evaluated with Chi-square test. Results were deemed as significant 

In 2016, our Pediatric ED registered 23197 visits, 603 (2.6%) of whom for "acute asthma," "wheezing bronchitis," or "bronchospasm". Of the 603 patients, 491 (81%) were discharged, while 112 children (19%) were admitted, 15% ( = 89) to a short-stay observation (up to 36 hours) and 4% ( = 23) to our Pediatric Unit Ward; 1 child was admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit after initial treatment in the Pediatric Ward.

The main features of the study population are described in Table 2 . Sixty-five percent of children ( = 394) were males, while the rest of them ( = 209; 35%) were females. The median age of the patients was 3.1 years (range: 2 months-14 years). Forty hundred fifty-nine patients were younger than 6 years (median 2.1 years; = 206 < 2 years; = 253 ≥ 2 years and <6 years), while the rest of them ( = 144; 24%) were school-aged children and adolescents (median 8.7 years).

At triage, 94 patients (15.6%) were given white colour tag, 282 (46.8%) green, 225 (37.3%) yellow, and 2 (0.3%) red ( Figure 1 ). The peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) upon arrival was <92% in 5.3% of cases, 92-95% in 34.4%, and >95% in 60.2%. The severity of the episode was classified as mild in 340 cases (56%), moderate in 237 (39%), and severe in 26 (4%), while none of the episodes was classified as lifethreatening.

The etiologies of the exacerbations are described in Figure 2 . < .01), while in children ≥6 years 33% of the exacerbations were triggered by an allergic condition (versus 3% in children <6 years; < .01).

One hundred ninety-one patients (31%) had a previous history of asthma or wheezing bronchitis and 54 of them (28%) were using an asthma controller therapy. Most had a mild exacerbation ( = 110; 57%) and 69 (36%) moderate, while only 12 (6%) presented a severe asthma attack. Sixteen percent of them required admission either to the short-stay observation or to the Pediatric Ward. Among the children with a previous asthma diagnosis, 95 (49%) were ≥6 years and 63 of them (67%) were not using any controller therapy (either for no prescription or for no use). The severity of the exacerbations in patients who are ≥6 years with a previous diagnosis of asthma and divided into two subgroups (controller therapy, no controller therapy) is shown in Figure 3 : asthmatic patients not using a controller medication were more likely to have a moderate-to-severe exacerbation than their peers under long-term therapy ( < .01).

The seasonal trend of the exacerbations is shown in Figure 4 . Children <6 years showed a peak of exacerbations in autumn and winter concurrently with the infectious epidemic season, while school-aged children and adolescents showed a different trend with a peak in early autumn and another one during the pollen season.

The present paper analyzes 603 consecutive visits for asthma exacerbations in our Pediatric ED. The proportion of visits for asthma that we describe (2.6%) is similar to that reported by Nath and Hsia in 2015 in a United States study (2.8%) [9] . According to what is described by Bekmezian et al. [10] , most patients were males and preschool-aged children. "Green" and "yellow" triage priority labels were the most frequently assigned to our patients; the severity was most often judged as mild or moderate and only in 4% of the patients as severe. Bekmezian et al. studied 1249 Pediatric ED visits for moderate-to-severe asthma exacerbations and reported that only 1% of them had a triage priority code "1" (comparable to our "red"); in most cases, a "2" or "3" code was assigned and, less frequently, a "4 or 5" code [10] .

Our data show that respiratory tract infections are the most common trigger for asthma exacerbations in both preschool-and school-aged children ( Figure 2 ). The importance of respiratory infectious agents, both viruses (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, and coronavirus) and bacteria (e.g., Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae), in the development of asthma exacerbations has been stressed by several authors [11] [12] [13] [14] . The role of infections in acute wheezing is even more evident in the first years of life. Indeed, our results highlight that almost all the wheezing preschool-aged children had an underlying respiratory illness. On the other hand, one-third of the children aged 6 or more had an asthma exacerbation induced by an allergic trigger, whereas in 10% the etiology could not be made out during the ED visit. In fact, several agents can elicit acute asthma: respiratory tract infections, environmental allergens, pollutants, and stress [14, 15] . Moreover, synergistic interactions between these factors might also very likely play a role [14] .

Exacerbations. The existence of seasonal cycles of asthma exacerbations is well established [7, 14, [16] [17] [18] . Children frequently experience a worsening of asthma when they return to school after the summer break; the peak of this "September asthma epidemics" is around 2 weeks after the start of school [7, 14, 16] . In 2006, Johnston and Sears examined data from the Canadian Institute of Health Information and found a clear seasonal pattern in ED visits and hospitalizations for asthma, showing, for the 5-15 years' age group, a relatively stable trend for the first 6 months of the year, a trough in the summer months, and then a rapid and substantial increase in mid-August, reaching the peak 2 weeks after return to school; in children aged 2-4, the pattern was similar but the peak less striking [16] . More recently, Cohen et al. analyzed data from 82234 asthmatic children and found that unscheduled primary care physicians visits and drug prescriptions for asthma were fluctuating during the first part of the year, had a decline in the summer months, and peaked in September with a lower peak in autumn [7] . Similarly to what is reported in the literature, our data show an increase in ED visits for asthma in early autumn, but with a difference between children aged 0-5 and ≥6 years (Figure 4 ). In the younger group, the peak starts in September, reaches its maximum in October, and then continues for the whole autumn and early winter. In the school-aged children, there is a peak only in September which is, however, lower than that observed during the spring, mainly in April and May.

The diversity between the two age groups can be explained by the different triggers that can induce asthma exacerbations, particularly allergic factors that hardly play a role in the preschool-aged children but are important in the school-aged ones. However, the reasons for the discrepancy between our data and those published in the literature, specifically the spring peak that we clearly highlight, are unclear. Possibly, differences in the climate and in the grass pollen spring outbreak might be part of the explanation.

Understanding the proportion of children with a preexisting diagnosis of asthma seeking advice in the ED for an exacerbation is important both for the individual patients and for the community, in terms of disease control and quality of life, and of healthcare costs, respectively. A history of acute asthma crises in the previous season or year was shown to be a risk factor for new exacerbations in 400 asthmatic patients aged 6-20 years [19] . Acute asthma exacerbations are largely preventable [2] , and so are ED visits and hospitalizations for this reason [9, [20] [21] [22] . In the United States, there have been federally funded initiatives to reduce this burden, such as school-based programs and a widespread dissemination of the guidelines, but a study performed on the total Pediatric ED visits from 2001 to 2010 highlighted that, despite these measures, the overall rate of potentially preventable ED visits for asthma did not change significantly over time [9] .

Among our patients, almost one-third had a previous diagnosis of asthma or wheezing. Half of them were in the school age, meaning that they were the real asthmatics of the case series, according to what is previously described by Stein and Martinez [23] . For them, the chance of needing hospitalization was higher than their peers with no previous asthma diagnosis. Among this group of older children with known asthma, up to 2/3 were not using controller medications, either for no prescription or for low compliance, and, according to our results, were at higher risk of a moderatesevere exacerbation than those using it. Controller medications are indicated in children with persistent asthma, and their correct use has been shown to reduce exacerbations and thereby ED visits for asthma [21, 24] . Evaluating asthma severity was beyond the goals of our study; thereby we cannot say how many of the 63 asthmatic children aged over 5 years and not using long-term controller therapy would have had a real need of such a prescription. However, the fact that so many asthmatic children were not using controller therapy, although our National Health System provides a pediatricsspecialized general practitioner for all children until the age of 14, seems to point out the need for an improvement in the territorial network of asthma management.

It is well established that patients with an acute asthma exacerbation are at high risk for future episodes [2] . This specific patient group should receive appropriate controller therapy, but leaning on following outpatients' visits has been demonstrated not to be reliable, as shown by a study on 3435 ED visits for asthma in children, only 18% of whom had a prescription for inhaled corticosteroids in the 2 months following the ED visit, only 12% attended follow-up appointments, and only 5.2% received both [25] . Even if the guidelines do not state that ED physicians should identify children with persistent asthma and start long-term therapy, some authors suggest that, in appropriate patients, inhaled corticosteroids might be prescribed at ED discharge [24, 26] ; however, the rates of such prescriptions are low [25, 26] .

As confirmed by our results, infections and allergy are the most frequent triggers in asthma exacerbations. In the light of this, also preventive measures are confirmed to play a relevant role in the management of pediatric asthma and should be strongly recommended in these patients. The efficacy of influenza inactivated vaccine in terms of reduction of the episodes of acute respiratory tract illnesses, asthma exacerbations, hospitalizations, and acute pharmacotherapy use in pediatric patients with mild persistent has been suggested [27] . In addition to this, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has extended the recommendation also for pneumococcal vaccination to asthmatic children and adolescents aged 6-18 years [28] .

Moreover, specific allergen-avoidance measures should also be addressed to all sensitized patients, for example, removing furry animals from the house in case of pet dander allergy, encasing mattresses in allergen-impermeable covers to reduce house dust mites exposure, cleaning from surfaces indoor molds using bleach solutions, and reducing pollen indoor exposure by closing windows and doors during high pollen counts in pollen allergic patients [29] .

A personalized written action plan, meaning a document explaining how to deal with the condition, particularly in the event of an attack, and when to refer to the doctor or the emergency services, is widely accepted as good practice in asthma education and self-management [30] . According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, providing patients with such a plan is a quality indicator and can improve outcomes such as self-efficacy, knowledge, and confidence for people with asthma. In those who have had a recent exacerbation, resulting in admission to hospital, it may reduce readmission rates [31] . Quite recently, a survey was conducted among 277 pediatricians in 6 European countries to assess the care for asthmatic children in the outpatients' setting in terms of therapeutic education; it turned out that 80% of the sampled patients received a personalized action plan during the visit (83% in Italy) [32] . Several papers consider the availability of an individualized action plan among the interventions that can help reducing ED visits for acute asthma [2, 20, 21] . Some authors also suggest the use of electronic action plans that might be delivered to the patients at ED discharge [33] .

Limitations of the Study. This is a retrospective, singlecenter study which considers only one year of ED visits for asthma. Other settings, such as rural, non-Pediatric EDs, or community, and general practitioners' outpatient services are thus not included. We could not analyze the therapy performed and/or proposed at discharge, nor asthma severity which had not been evaluated or recorded during the ED visit.

All children of any age were included; however, in those aged ≤12 months bronchiolitis might be mistaken for a wheezing bronchitis.

Despite the several limitations, our paper points out some important differences in asthma exacerbations between preschool-and school-aged children concerning etiology and seasonal trends, specific for our climate. It also highlights the need for an improved management of asthmatic patients outside the ED and a tighter connection with outpatients' services: individualized written action plans should always be available; moreover, recommending vaccinations and allergen-avoidance measures might be useful, as well as prescribing controller medications at ED discharge in those patients with known chronic asthma and under no therapy.

The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.

Distinct Lineages of Feline Parvovirus Associated with Epizootic Outbreaks in Australia, New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates

Feline panleukopenia (FPL), a frequently fatal disease of cats, is caused by feline parvovirus (FPV) or canine parvovirus (CPV). We investigated simultaneous outbreaks of FPL between 2014 and 2018 in Australia, New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) where FPL outbreaks had not been reported for several decades. Case data from 989 cats and clinical samples from additional 113 cats were obtained to determine the cause of the outbreaks and epidemiological factors involved. Most cats with FPL were shelter-housed, 9 to 10 weeks old at diagnosis, unvaccinated, had not completed a primary vaccination series or had received vaccinations noncompliant with current guidelines. Analysis of parvoviral VP2 sequence data confirmed that all FPL cases were caused by FPV and not CPV. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that each of these outbreaks was caused by a distinct FPV, with two virus lineages present in eastern Australia and virus movement between different geographical locations. Viruses from the UAE outbreak formed a lineage of unknown origin. FPV vaccine virus was detected in the New Zealand cases, highlighting the difficulty of distinguishing the co-incidental shedding of vaccine virus in vaccinated cats. Inadequate vaccination coverage in shelter-housed cats was a common factor in all outbreaks, likely precipitating the multiple re-emergence of infection events.

Feline panleukopenia (FPL) is a highly contagious and often fatal disease characterised by acute severe enteritis, severe dehydration and sepsis due to lymphoid depletion and pancytopenia [1] . FPL is usually associated with infection by feline parvovirus (FPV), a member of the genus Protoparvovirus (formerly Feline panleukopenia virus). Protoparovirus is one of eight genera of vertebrate viruses within the subfamily Parvovirinae of the family Parvoviridae. Collectively, FPV and canine parvovirus (CPV), along with associated variants found in various carnivore species such as mink and raccoons, constitute the species Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 [2] .

Until the 1980s, FPV was the only reported viral cause of FPL in cats. FPV is able to infect cats by first binding to the feline transferrin receptor (fTfR) expressed on the surface of cells, followed by clathrin-mediated endocytosis to initiate infection [3] . Canine parvovirus CPV-2 emerged in the late 1970s and was initially unable to infect cats, as it could not bind to the fTfR [3] . However, infectivity for feline cells was acquired soon after by the genetic variant CPV-2a, which emerged in 1979 and replaced CPV-2 [4] . The ability to infect cats has also been retained by subsequent antigenic variants of CPV-2a, termed CPV-2b and CPV-2c, which only differ from CPV-2a at a single amino acid position (VP2 426). These and other antigenic variants of CPV can cause FPL in both naturally acquired and experimental infections of cats [5] [6] [7] [8] .

In contrast to parvoviral enteritis in dogs, estimated to cause 20,000 cases per year in Australia, clinical cases of FPL have rarely been diagnosed in Australia since the mid-1970s, and there have been no reports of FPL outbreaks for over 40 years [9] . In 2014, FPL re-emerged in eastern Australia, and subsequent outbreaks occurred between 2015 and 2018 in several locations in this region. Similarly, outbreaks of FPL occurred in New Zealand (NZ) between 2016 and 2018, as well as in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in 2017, with no outbreaks of FPL reported in either country in recent decades, likely due to the widespread use of FPL vaccines.

The contemporaneous re-emergence of FPL in geographically distinct settings long considered FPL-free has raised questions as to whether virus-related or other unknown risk factors played a role in the observed FPL outbreaks. Herein, case data and clinical samples from 989 and 113 cats, respectively, were analysed to identify the lineages of Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 responsible for the outbreaks of FPL in Australia (2014 to 2018), the UAE (2017) and NZ (2017-2018) and evaluate epidemiological factors associated with these outbreaks, including vaccination status.

Inclusion criteria for cases of FPL were (i) clinical signs typical of FPL (lethargy, fever, hypothermia, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhoea and/or sudden death) and a positive confirmatory test (faecal CPV antigen test or PCR) or (ii) clinical signs typical of FPL in a cat from a shelter with a confirmed contemporaneous outbreak of FPL.

Australian case data were extracted from a national online companion animal disease surveillance-reporting database launched in January 2010 [10] and from the medical records of animal shelters and/or veterinary hospitals in outbreak regions for the period 1 January 2014 to 31 August 2018. Data recorded included case occurrence date, shelter location, shelter post code, age at diagnosis, sex, post code of owner residence or where found as a stray before entry into shelter, clinical signs at presentation, date of last vaccination, vaccination type (inactivated or modified live virus (MLV) vaccine), time interval between last vaccination and onset of clinical signs (days), method of diagnosis and outcome. Data obtained were searched to identify cases for which serial monitoring of faecal shedding of FPV or CPV using qPCR testing had been performed. Information about animal movements, biosecurity and vaccination protocols was obtained from shelter veterinarians and/or managers. New Zealand case data were obtained from one shelter, comprising summary data of case diagnoses for two FPL outbreaks occurring between 2016 and 2018 as well as individual data for 9 cases in which clinical samples were available for PCR and sequencing. Individual case data for UAE cases were available during the period of the outbreak in 2017.

Data were analysed using Microsoft Excel ® for Mac Version 16.16.15 and Statistix ® version 10.0 (Analytical Software, Tallahassee, FL, USA). Descriptive statistics were generated for FPL case numbers, age at disease diagnosis, interval between vaccination and disease and interval between admission and disease. Frequency distributions were created for age at disease diagnosis. Mapping and geospatial analysis was performed with ArcGIS ® version 10.2 (Ersi, Redlands, CA, USA).

Residual diagnostic faecal samples or tissue (intestine or mesenteric lymph node) obtained post-mortem were collected prospectively in Australia from 7 April 2015 until 30 August 2018 and from the UAE and New Zealand during suspected outbreaks of FPL in 2017. In addition, a stored faecal sample from a cat diagnosed with FPL in the first outbreak in Australia in 2014 was obtained for study.

DNA was extracted for sequencing of the Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 VP2 gene from tissue using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) or from faecal samples using the QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) or by homogenisation, boiling and centrifugation, as previously described [11] . The extracted DNA was amplified by conventional PCR using 5 u/µL of My Taq HS Red DNA polymerase (Bioline, USA), 1-90 ng of DNA, 1 x MyTaq Red reaction buffer and a final primer concentration of 0.2 µM in a final reaction volume of 25 µL. Three sets of overlapping primers were used to amplify the entire VP2 region (1931 bp) as described previously, with minor modifications (Table 1 ) [12] . An initial denaturation step at 94 • C for 1 min, followed by 35-40 cycles of denaturation at 94 • C for 30 s, annealing at 50 or 55 • C for 30 s and extension at 72 • C for 30 s, ending with a final extension at 72 • C for 1 min, was used for DNA amplification. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) in 1× tris-acetate EDTA and visualized using SYBR Safe DNA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Sanger sequencing of positive PCR products was performed commercially (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea). 

VP2 sequences were edited, assembled and aligned using the ClustalW algorithm in Geneious Prime (Biomatters Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand) (although alignment was uncontroversial with no gaps needed). Sequences were translated in MegaX, and amino acid substitutions compared to the ICTV reference FPV sequence (FVP-3 Genbank accession no. EU659111) were identified. To determine the evolutionary history of the outbreak sequences from Australia, New Zealand and Dubai, we performed a phylogenetic analysis including these sequences and representative VP2 sequences of FPV and CPV taken from GenBank. In addition, we included an FPV VP2 sequence obtained from tissues of a healthy feral cat from Tasmania, Australia, sampled in 2010 (Genbank accession no. MN603976), for comparison. This resulted in a total data set of 205 sequences, 1774 nt in length. Phylogenetic analysis of these was performed using the PhyML program [13] and employing the GTR+I+Γ model of nucleotide substitution and a combination of Nearest-Neighbor Interchange (NNI) and Sub-tree Pruning & Re-grafting (SPR) branch swapping. Nodal support was assessed using SH-like branch support. Finally, the five CPV sequences included were used as an outgroup clade to root the tree.

An FPV strain identical to that used in a commercially available MLV FPV vaccine was detected in faecal samples from New Zealand cases. Subsequently, qPCR was performed to determine FPV viral loads in DNA extracts of mesenteric lymph nodes and tissues from these cases using a TaqMan qPCR assay as described previously [14] . Faecal samples containing vaccine virus were also submitted to a commercial laboratory for batch testing on a multiplex qPCR panel to detect potential faecal co-pathogens including Feline coronavirus, Tritrichomonas foetus, Clostridium perfringens, Giardia spp, Salmonella spp, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli and Toxoplasma gondii (Idexx Pty Ltd.).

Tissues (duodenum, jejunum, colon, liver, spleen, kidney, mesenteric lymph node, heart, lung, pancreas, brain and/or bone marrow) from 11 representative Australian FPL cases that had died or been euthanised, ranging in age from 8 weeks to 12 months, including one from Melbourne in 2014 and 10 from Sydney in 2017 and 2018, were available for histological examination. Tissues (intestine, +/− mesenteric lymph node) from six suspected cases of FPL from New Zealand were also examined. All tissues were collected post-mortem and animals were not euthanised for the purposes of this study.

Data were received from 610 cases of FPL diagnosed in Australia between January 2014 and September 2018 from 11 animal shelters, 2 rescue societies and 11 veterinary hospitals. Of the 610 cases, 87% were shelter-housed, 12% were privately owned cats presenting to veterinary hospitals, and 1% were from foster carers working with rescue societies without premises. The distribution of Australian cases by geographic region and year is shown in Table 2 and Figure 1 . Figure S1 ).

The distribution of cases varied with month of presentation and is shown in Figure 3 . Frequent transfer of cats in Victoria between shelters in Mildura (Outbreak 2 site) and Melbourne (Outbreak 1 site) suggested direct spread of the infection between these regions. Cats from two private shelters in Mildura were transported for rehoming to a shelter in Melbourne in 2014 and 2015. 

Two of five shelters in NSW did not vaccinate cats while under their care. The other three shelters vaccinated healthy cats on admission using an inactivated FPV vaccine, whereas sick cats with suspected viral respiratory tract infections were not vaccinated until their clinical signs resolved.

None of the three shelters in Mildura vaccinated cats. Of the three shelters in Melbourne, one did not vaccinate cats, while two vaccinated cats on admission, one using an inactivated vaccine and the other an MLV vaccine. All shelters that used vaccinations gave a primary course to kittens starting at a minimum age of 6 weeks, then every 3 to 4 weeks, finishing at 12 to 14 weeks of age, while adult cats were given two vaccinations one month apart. Both rescue societies, one in NSW and one in Victoria, accepted unvaccinated cats and kittens for adoption from municipal pounds (shelters), that were fostered until adoption. For 177 shelter-housed cats, the median time from admission to diagnosis of FPL was 9 days (IQR 0-17; range 0-61 days).

Of the 610 cats diagnosed with FPL, 528 (87%) had never been vaccinated or had an unknown vaccination history. Sixty-five of the 82 (79%) cats that had received at least one vaccination were <16 weeks of age at the time of their last vaccination. For 17 cats ≥16 weeks of age at the time of last vaccination, the vaccination-to-disease interval was >10 days for 4/5 cats vaccinated with ≥2 inactivated vaccines and >7 days for 7/11 cats vaccinated with at least one MLV vaccine; vaccine type was unknown for one cat. For all vaccinated cats, the median time from last vaccination to diagnosis was 7.5 days (IQR 2-11; range 1-109 days).

Age, sex and breed data were available for 399 FPL cases. The median age at diagnosis was 10 weeks (IQR 7-20 weeks; range 3 weeks-96 months). The frequency distribution of age at diagnosis is shown in Table 3 Males (49%) and females (51%) were equally represented among FPL cases. Most cats (98%) were domestic crossbred (domestic shorthair or domestic longhair). Data on specific clinical signs were available for 153 cats. The most common clinical signs were diarrhoea (54%), lethargy (48%), vomiting (36%), anorexia (27%), weight loss or failure to gain weight (14%) and sudden death (10%). Diarrhoea was reported to be haemorrhagic in 13 of 83 cats (16%) with diarrhoea. Overall mortality for all 610 cats was 95%, noting that cases diagnosed in shelters were routinely euthanised at diagnosis to contain the infection. 

Two FPL outbreaks occurred in Wellington, New Zealand, in December 2016 and January 2018. The seasonal distribution of cases in the second outbreak is shown in Figure 3 . In total, 365 cases of FPL were diagnosed, including 167 in the first outbreak and 198 in the second. During both outbreaks, 8% of feline admissions to the shelter were diagnosed with FPL. The median age at diagnosis was 9 weeks (IQR 6-14 weeks, range 2-105 weeks). At diagnosis of FPL, 32% of cats were unvaccinated, 58% had received one vaccine, 8% had been vaccinated twice, and 2% had been vaccinated three times. The median time since the last vaccination was 7 days (IQR 4-11.5 days, range 1-36 days). The median time from shelter admission to diagnosis was 7 days (IQR 0-14 days, range 0-28 days).

Of the nine cases for which clinical samples were available for PCR and sequencing, all cats had a positive faecal CPV antigen test result (FASTest Parvo Strip, Megacor Hoerbranz, Austria) and were euthanised at diagnosis. All cats had been vaccinated on admission using an MLV FPV vaccine (Felocell 3 or Felocell 4, Zoetis Pty. Ltd.). Clinical data are presented in Table 3 .

Fourteen cases of FPL from Dubai, UAE, were diagnosed in domestic crossbreds with positive faecal CPV antigen test results. All cats were strays or strays that had been recently adopted, and all were unvaccinated, except an 18-month-old cat that had received a primary course of kitten vaccinations and a booster vaccination at 12 months. Clinical signs included vomiting, diarrhoea and lethargy, and the median age at diagnosis was 4 months (range 1-18 months). All cats were treated, and outcomes were known in 12 cases, of which 8 died or were euthanised, and 4 survived.

In sections of duodenum and jejunum from the 11 representative cases, there was a mild to severe necrotizing lymphoplasmacytic-to-suppurative enteritis, characterized by variable blunting, fusion and loss of villi, collapse of the lamina propria, loss of crypts and replacement by abundant coccobacilli and necrotic debris. The remaining crypts were often ectatic, with variable numbers of crypt abscesses ( Figure 4 ). Evidence of multifocal crypt regeneration was also variably present. The submucosa and tunica muscularis were variably expanded by congestion, fibrin, oedema, haemorrhage, perivascular lymphocytes and plasma cells, macrophages exhibiting erythrophagocytosis, occasional neutrophils and rare eosinophils. In sections of mesenteric lymph nodes, the most common finding was multifocal follicular and paracortical lymphoid depletion with accentuation of the reticuloendothelial architecture ( Figure 4 ). Depleted lymphoid follicles were small, poorly populated and contained central accumulations of hyalinized eosinophilic material (follicular hyalinosis) with variable numbers of tangible body macrophages. The subcapsular and medullary sinuses were expanded by erythrocytes, oedema fluid and moderate to markedly increased numbers of macrophages, some exhibiting erythrophagocytosis.

Mild-to-moderate multifocal lymphoid depletion was also apparent in splenic sections. Extramedullary haematopoiesis characterized by the presence of myeloid and erythroid precursors was variably present within spleen and lymph nodes.

Sections of bone marrow examined were either hypocellular, characterised by increased numbers of, predominantly, adipocytes and extravasated erythrocytes interspersed with very low numbers of erythroid and myeloid precursors and megakaryocytes, or hypercellular, with increased numbers of myeloid and erythroid precursors. Some sections of the liver demonstrated hepatocellular atrophy and congestion, with minimal periportal mononuclear infiltrates. Among the sections of myocardium examined, there were no significant lesions.

Histopathology of the small intestine was performed in six cases, including five in which samples were collected for PCR and sequencing (Table 4 ). In four of these, lesions of mild enteritis (n = 3) or fibrosis of the lamina propria (n = 1) were present. In one case (221, Table 3 ), histological lesions were typical of FPL ( Figure 5) , with multiple sections of jejunum and ileum showing mild multifocal loss and replacement of crypts by karyorrhectic and cellular debris (necrosis) and low-to-moderate numbers of neutrophils within the lamina propria. Low numbers of the remaining crypts were variably lined by degenerate or necrotic epithelium with intraluminal degenerate neutrophils, debris and sloughed necrotic epithelial cells (crypt abscesses). Neutrophils frequently invaded the remaining crypt epithelium. Rare epithelial cells contained 4-6 µm-diameter polygonal-to-ovoid, eosinophilic-to-amphophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies that occasionally marginated the chromatin. There was moderate multifocal crypt regeneration, and crypts were frequently lined by large epithelial cells with vesicular nuclei that were piled up or in mitosis. Intestinal lymphoid tissue appeared mildly depleted. The morphological diagnosis was moderate diffuse acute neutrophilic enteritis with crypt necrosis, epithelial regeneration and rare intranuclear viral inclusions. These findings were consistent with FPV/CPV infection. (Table 4 ). Of the cases where sections of mesenteric lymph nodes (n = 3) or thymus (n = 1) were available, lesions of mild follicular lymphoid depletion were present in one case, which was the same animal with small intestinal lesions consistent with FPV (case 221). Affected cortical follicles were small and poorly populated.

Histopathology was also performed on intestine and mesenteric lymph nodes from one unvaccinated cat with clinical signs of FPL, but for which samples were not collected for PCR and sequencing. Changes in the duodenum were similar to but more severe than those described above in case 221, including crypt necrosis and abscessation, neutrophilic infiltration of the lamina propria and the presence within epithelial cells of intranuclear inclusion bodies which variably marginated the chromatin. There was moderate lymphoid depletion in mesenteric lymph node tissue. These findings were also consistent with FPV/CPV infection. 

The entire VP2 region of Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 was amplified from 113 suspected cases of FPL, comprising 93 from Australia, 11 from Dubai and 9 from New Zealand. Amino acid substitutions compared to the FPV reference strain are listed in Table 5 . All VP2 sequences in this study were identified as FPV, with no cases attributed to CPV. Phylogenetic analysis of these VP2 sequences in comparison to a background global data set of FPV sequences revealed the presence of four distinct clades of Australian viruses ( Figure 6 ). The first, denoted clade A, comprises 19 viruses (17 of which were identical) sampled from a wide geographic area (Melbourne, Geelong and Mildura) between 2014 and 2017. In contrast, Australia clade B comprised just two identical sequences sampled in NSW in 2015. These viruses were detected in the faeces collected from two cats in the same shelter in Sydney, NSW, in November 2015. Both cats had severe diarrhoea and tested positive for Salmonella spp. and Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 on a multiplex faecal qPCR panel (Idexx Pty Ltd.). The largest Australian clade (C) comprised 66 viruses from NSW and one from Queensland, collected between December 2016 and February 2018. Viruses collected from cats in North Western NSW (Gunnedah) and South Eastern Queensland (Nambour) in 2017 were identical to those sampled from cats from four shelters and from privately owned cats in Sydney. Viruses from cats from the NSW Central Coast also fell into this clade. Finally, one sequence isolated from a cat from Melbourne in 2018 (FPV_251) was identical to viruses in clade C, with the exception of a mutation at position 694 (A694G) that resulted in an amino acid substitution I to V. This mutation was also present in viruses in Clade A. 

This study 2016-2018 

A fourth (although not strictly monophyletic) clade (D) of viral sequences from Australian cats contained three VP2 sequences identical to that of an FPV vaccine strain (Purevax; Genbank accession no. EU498680) and two sequences that are very closely related to the vaccine strain. In one of these, from a 6-week-old kitten with acute vomiting and failure to gain weight, the vaccine strain was unlikely to be the cause of the cat's clinical signs. FPL was suspected because a multiplex qPCR faecal panel was positive for Giardia spp. and Canine protoparvovirus 1. However, the cat, from Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory, had been vaccinated 16 days before with the same MLV vaccine strain.

No littermates were affected, the cat recovered, and no other cases of suspected FPL were encountered in this region. Another sequence in this clade was from a 14-week-old stray kitten with vomiting, diarrhoea and failure to gain weight. The kitten, from a shelter in Melbourne, had been vaccinated 16 days before with the same MLV vaccine. It also tested positive on a multiplex qPCR faecal panel for Giardia spp. and Canine protoparvovirus 1. The third sequence was from an owned 8-week-old kitten in Sydney with acute onset vomiting and diarrhoea, vaccinated 3 days before (vaccine type unknown). Of the two closely related VP2 sequences, one (FPV_260) was from a 10-week-old kitten vaccinated 4 days before with the same vaccine strain, which presented for diarrhoea, vomiting and lethargy. It also tested positive for Giardia spp. on a faecal antigen test. The other (FPV_254) was from an unvaccinated stray 8-month-old cat that presented with vomiting, diarrhoea and anorexia and tested positive on a faecal CPV antigen test. Finally, two other Australian sequences-FPV 193/170 and Tasmania/2010-did not fall into a distinct clade but were relatively closely related to each other and to the vaccine cluster (clade D).

All 11 VP2 sequences from cats from Dubai fell into a single clade containing four unique sequence types and which was not clearly related to any other of the FPV sequences. In contrast, those viruses sampled from New Zealand in 2017 were either identical (eight of nine animals) or clearly very closely related to a vaccine strain (Felocell, Zoetis Pty Ltd.) and taken from cats with a history of recent vaccination. The single sequence that was not identical to that of the vaccine strain exhibited just two nucleotide substitutions, one of which was non-synonymous (E155K) ( Table 4 ).

The results of the qPCR analyses to quantify FPV viral load in faeces of NZ cats and to detect faecal co-pathogens are presented in Table 4 . Medical records were obtained from two unvaccinated kittens with FPL from Australia, where serial monitoring of FPV faecal shedding using qPCR was performed on pooled faecal samples after diagnosis. Testing was done at a single commercial laboratory, and results were reported as positive or negative (Table 6 ). Table 6 . Results of serial monitoring of faecal shedding of FPV in faecal samples from two cats diagnosed with FPL. 

An understanding of the drivers of the re-emergence of FPL, the oldest known viral disease of cats, is essential to contain this fatal infection. We provide strong evidence of multiple outbreaks of FPL in three countries. There are no previous published reports of FPL outbreaks in any of these regions for comparison, although there is anecdotal first-hand experience of FPL among veterinarians practicing in Australia from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s, before commercial vaccines were used routinely [1] . Despite the widespread circulation of CPV in Australia, this virus was not detected in any samples tested in these FPL outbreaks. Canine parvovirus causes approximately 5% of FPL cases globally, but these have been confined to sporadic individual cases, and there are no reports of FPL outbreaks caused by CPV in multi-cat environments [8, 15, 16] . Whether this is due to viral or to host factors is currently unknown and warrants further investigation.

A single FPV lineage (clade A) was responsible for disease in both outbreak regions in Victoria, Australia, even though these are geographically distant (550 km) from each other. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the closest related virus was taken from a domestic cat in Japan in 1994 (GenBank accession no. AB000050), although it is likely that a closer ancestral virus exists but has not been sampled here. The 100% sequence identity of VP2 sequences from cases in Mildura and Melbourne is consistent with the epidemiological investigation, which found evidence supporting direct viral spread through transport of unvaccinated cats for adoption in 2014 and 2015. The nonenveloped virions of FPV, shed in high titres in all excretions of infected animals, are environmentally resilient and remain viable in infected premises such as shelters for over a year [17, 18] . Indirect transmission by fomites is a major mechanism of parvovirus transmission among cats and dogs and was likely a crucial contributing factor to the canine global CPV pandemic in the late 1970s [19] .

Unexpectedly, the FPL outbreak in Sydney, NSW, was not caused by spread of the Victorian strain, but rather by a separate clade (C) comprising a relatively distinct virus [20, 21] . This finding, together with the detection of additional Australian FPVs (Clades B and D), is consistent with multiple independent virus entries into Australia, including the virus from an unvaccinated cat (clade D), which was seemingly derived from an FPV vaccine strain. Three recently vaccinated cats, in which the same vaccine virus was detected (clade D), likely did not have FPL, including two with Giardia co-infections initially diagnosed with FPL from a positive commercial faecal qPCR assay. MLV vaccine virus shed in faeces can be detected in qPCR assays and CPV faecal antigen tests [22, 23] . Quantifying viral loads can assist in the discrimination of vaccine and field strains. However, quantification data were not provided by the commercial laboratory for these two cases. CPV vaccine viral loads in recently vaccinated dogs are 4-to 5-fold lower than those of dogs infected with field strains [24] . Similarly, a recent report found several recently vaccinated cats had low FPV viral loads (<1.38 × 10 2 copies/mg of faeces) over a 28-day period of surveillance [23] .

Before this investigation, only one FPV VP2 sequence from Australia had been deposited in the GenBank database (FPV 193/70, GenBank accession no. X55115). The evolutionary relationships with FPV 193/70 cannot be inferred reliably, since the isolate, obtained from a 3-month-old cat in Melbourne with peracute fatal FPL, had been serially passaged in vitro before sequencing in 1990. Interestingly, FPV 193/70 falls notably close to a clade of vaccine viruses in our analysis. In addition, we generated the VP2 sequence of an FPV strain detected in a healthy feral cat from Tasmania in 2010, which was genetically distinct from outbreak strains in this study and also fell into clade D, suggesting a vaccine-related origin. These findings, together with a report of FPV detection in the bone marrow of a healthy feral cat from Melbourne in 2012 [25] , provide evidence that FPV has been circulating widely in Australia, at least since the 1970s, although the viruses are phylogenetically unrelated to the 2015-2018 outbreaks.

One possible explanation for the multiple independent FPV introductions described here is that FPV viruses circulating in the feral cat population may occasionally spill over into domestic cats. In comparison to the owned cat population, estimated at 3.8 million [26] , some 2.1 to 6.3 million feral cats (free-roaming, unowned, unsocialised cats) inhabit Australia [27] . An FPV seroprevalence of 79% among feral cats in Victoria and NSW, documented in 1981, provides evidence of widespread FPV exposure [28] . Viral introductions could also have been anthropogenic, for example through fomite spread during international travel.

We were also able to analyse sequence data from a contemporaneous FPL outbreak in the UAE in 2018. This is the first study to characterise full-length VP2 sequences from the Middle East. Viruses most closely related to the UAE viruses, which formed a phylogenetically distinct lineage, were from a range of locations in Europe, Asia and the Americas, but the long lineage leading to the UAE viruses suggests that we have not yet sampled their ultimate ancestor.

The VP2 sequence data from cases analysed from a third country with contemporaneous FPL outbreaks showed that the NZ FPV strains segregated with FPV vaccine viruses. The virological findings from these cases yet again highlight the difficulty of diagnosing FPL in cats that have recently received MLV vaccines, as well as raising important questions about the potential capacity of reversion to virulence of MLV vaccines. The diagnosis of FPL in cases from NZ was initially based on consistent clinical signs and a positive faecal antigen test. Point-of-care immunochromatographic assays designed to detect CPV faecal antigen also detect FPV, so are used in practice for the diagnostic investigation of cats with clinical signs consistent with FPL [22] . However, faecal antigen tests detect both field and vaccine strains of FPV and CPV. In one study evaluating three commercial CPV faecal antigen kits, 20% of cats vaccinated against FPV in the preceding 14 days returned positive test results [29] .

The sensitivity of faecal antigen tests for the detection of parvoviruses is influenced by viral load in faeces, as well as by the presence of gut antibodies that can sequestrate viral particles and prevent binding to the test antibody [30] . CPV vaccine viral loads in recently vaccinated dogs are usually below the limit of detection of antigen tests, ranging from 1.48 × 10 0 to 2.5 × 10 4 copies/mg of faeces in one study [24] and from ≈10 0 to 7.50 × 10 5 copies/mg of faeces in another [31] . The lower limit of detection of faecal antigen tests for CPV in dogs is 10 5 to 10 6 viral DNA copies per mg of faeces [32] . Low titres of gut FPV antibodies in the New Zealand cats could explain the positive faecal antigen test results in those cats with low faecal viral loads.

All but one of the VP2 sequences obtained from the New Zealand cases were identical to the FPV vaccine strain that the cats had been inoculated with. Co-infection with other pathogens including Feline coronavirus or Giardia spp. could account for the clinical signs in five of these cases, which, although consistent with FPL, were non-specific. However, in one cat, high loads of vaccine strain virus were detected concurrently in lymph node and faeces (FPV_221, Table 3 ), which is more consistent with loads attained by pathogenic virus strains than with those attained by vaccine virus strains. Further, unequivocal support of the diagnosis of FPL in this case was obtained from histological examination of the intestine, where lesions pathognomonic for FPL were identified ( Figure 5 ). An FPV-vaccine strain was detected in this cat, and the sequencing chromatogram showed no evidence of a coinfecting FPV or CPV. However, deep sequencing of the sample with examination of the metatranscriptome or metagenome would be required to rule out co-infection with other pathogenic viruses not included in the qPCR test panel. An alternative explanation is that there was reversion to virulence of the vaccine strain, although this has not been described previously in cats.

Molecular analysis of faeces from dogs displaying signs of acute gastroenteritis shortly after CPV vaccination ruled out reversion to virulence of CPV MLV, since co-infection with field strains of CPV or other pathogens including Canine coronavirus, Canine distemper virus and Isospora canis was detected [33] . In three pups in which only the vaccine virus was detected, CPV vaccine loads were lower than those associated with enteritis from CPV field strains, ranging from 1.03 × 10 3 to 1.78 × 10 5 DNA copies/mg of faeces [33] .

The re-emergence of FPL in two Australian states in relatively quick succession over a three-year period, caused by two distinct FPV lineages, raises the question as to why this disease is re-emerging now, after decades of apparent quiescence. Animal shelters are conducive environments for pathogen emergence or re-emergence because of a large number of susceptible hosts living in a confined area. This is exacerbated by factors including young age, immunological naivety or immunosuppression, close contact and co-morbidities such as heavy parasite burdens. Similarly, suboptimal biosecurity protocols favour pathogen persistence and fomite transmission [34] .

Failure to vaccinate or inadequate or inappropriate vaccination in shelter-housed cats were major contributors to the re-emergence of FPL in Australia. Before these outbreaks, over half of the shelters from which cases were derived did not administer FPV vaccinations. In general, FPV vaccines are a highly effective tool in parvovirus control. For example, protective FPV antibody titres were measured in 95% of vaccinated cats in a field study of adult cats after MLV vaccination, of which 64% had pre-existing protective titres [35] . In addition, viral challenge studies of FPV-vaccinated cats usually show vaccine efficacy >90% [36] . Although state legislation mandates vaccination of owned cats in commercial boarding facilities in NSW and Victoria, vaccination is not enforced for cats admitted to private or municipal animal shelters, until they are sold for rehoming. Most shelters that did vaccinate, completed the primary course of vaccinations in kittens by 12 to 14 weeks of age and used inactivated vaccines, in contravention of the current guidelines. The World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) Vaccination Guidelines recommend the use of MLV vaccines in shelter-housed cats for rapid induction of long-lasting humoral immunity [22, 37] . A minimum age of 16 weeks for the final vaccination in the primary course is recommended, based on the failure of 45% of kittens to seroconvert after vaccinations at 8 and 12 weeks of age with the commercial FPV MLV vaccination [37, 38] . This immunity gap relates to persistent maternally derived antibodies (MDA) in kittens, which decline below protective titres yet effectively neutralize the vaccine virus and thereby prevent seroconversion [38] . Persistent MDA would explain the presence of vaccination non-responders in our study that were <16 weeks of age at the time of diagnosis of FPL, highlighting that vaccination alone cannot prevent disease in environments where susceptible kittens are exposed to FPV.

Among the 21% of vaccination non-responders that were older than 16 weeks, some were likely exposed to FPV prior to seroconversion, either before or after admission to the shelter, as indicated by the median vaccination-to-diagnosis interval of 7.5 days. The incubation period for FPL is between 2 and 10 days [17] . Other reasons for apparent vaccine failure include persistence of MDA for >16 weeks in kittens born to queens with high anti-FPV antibody titres or failure to mount an immune response to vaccination because of immunodeficiency (acquired or genetic), incorrect vaccine administration or storage errors [35, 38] .

The median time from shelter admission to diagnosis of FPL was 9 days. The minimum holding time for unidentified cats in municipal shelters in the states of Victoria and NSW is 7 days, after which cats can be euthanised or rehomed (Domestic Animals Act 1994, Companion Animals Act 1998). Changes in euthanasia practices resulting in longer length of stay (LOS) may have contributed to a cumulative increase in selection pressure for FPL re-emergence, especially in shelters where vaccination was not practiced. The likelihood of exposure to infectious diseases increases within a shelter environment with increasing LOS [39] . National data from Royal Society of Prevention to Cruelty (RSPCA) shelters show a progressive decline in euthanasia rates from 74% in 1995 to 27% in 2018 [40, 41] . Similar declines in euthanasia have occurred in shelters in other countries such as Canada [42] .

A seasonal pattern of FPL was identified in Australia and New Zealand, with an annual peak in case numbers from December to May. This pattern may reflect waning maternal immunity lagging two to three months behind the peak kitten births. Similar seasonality of FPL outbreaks was reported in the Northern Hemisphere, where seasons are inverted; case numbers peaked from July to December and were correlated with an influx of kittens born annually in spring and waning of maternal immunity over the subsequent two to three months [43] .

The duration of faecal shedding of FPV, which is relevant to infection control, has been inadequately studied. This study demonstrates that virus can be shed in faeces for an extended period of up to 14 weeks from diagnosis. Faecal shedding of vaccine virus was detected by qPCR post vaccination for the duration of one four-week study [23] . Shedding of field CPV strains in dogs has been detected by qPCR for 45-50 days [44, 45] , while CPV vaccine virus was shed for 19-22 days on average [31, 46] . Further studies are warranted in cats to further define the duration of faecal shedding of both field and vaccine strains of FPV detectable by qPCR.

Inadequate vaccination coverage was identified in the FPL outbreaks described here and was a major contributor to the re-emergence of this disease. These outbreaks highlight the importance of adherence to vaccination guidelines for shelters, recommended by professional bodies such as the WSAVA. Further research is needed to identify the duration of FPV shedding in naturally infected cats, as well as the potential for reversion to virulence of MLV vaccines. 

SEED Servers: High-Performance Access to the SEED Genomes, Annotations, and Metabolic Models

The remarkable advance in sequencing technology and the rising interest in medical and environmental microbiology, biotechnology, and synthetic biology resulted in a deluge of published microbial genomes. Yet, genome annotation, comparison, and modeling remain a major bottleneck to the translation of sequence information into biological knowledge, hence computational analysis tools are continuously being developed for rapid genome annotation and interpretation. Among the earliest, most comprehensive resources for prokaryotic genome analysis, the SEED project, initiated in 2003 as an integration of genomic data and analysis tools, now contains .5,000 complete genomes, a constantly updated set of curated annotations embodied in a large and growing collection of encoded subsystems, a derived set of protein families, and hundreds of genome-scale metabolic models. Until recently, however, maintaining current copies of the SEED code and data at remote locations has been a pressing issue. To allow high-performance remote access to the SEED database, we developed the SEED Servers (http://www.theseed.org/servers): four network-based servers intended to expose the data in the underlying relational database, support basic annotation services, offer programmatic access to the capabilities of the RAST annotation server, and provide access to a growing collection of metabolic models that support flux balance analysis. The SEED servers offer open access to regularly updated data, the ability to annotate prokaryotic genomes, the ability to create metabolic reconstructions and detailed models of metabolism, and access to hundreds of existing metabolic models. This work offers and supports a framework upon which other groups can build independent research efforts. Large integrations of genomic data represent one of the major intellectual resources driving research in biology, and programmatic access to the SEED data will provide significant utility to a broad collection of potential users.

The growth in the number of sequenced genomes has exceeded the most ambitious past estimations [1, 2] . Today, tens of thousands of genomes are being sequenced by public and private institutions around the globe [3, 4] , and whole-genome sequencing/re-sequencing has become a routine step of virtually any analysis of microbial behavior. In some fields, researchers are sequencing hundreds of genomes from distant taxa [5] to explore microbial diversity, while elsewhere, hundreds of closely related genomes are being sequenced to understand environmental adaptation, to support pangenome reconstruction [6, 7, 8] , and to build maps of microbial variomes [9] . Sequencing is also being applied to aid in solving urgent biological problems, including the development of strategies to combat emerging or reemerging biothreats, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus [10] , the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus [11, 12] , and the 2011 German Escherichia coli outbreak [13, 14] .

With the vast speed and minimal costs of modern sequencing technology, new demands are being placed on the bioinformatics pipelines used to analyze sequence data [1] . Modern bioinformatics must be high throughput and high volume with a strong emphasis on comparative genomics, and the SEED family of resources for genome interpretation and analysis were specifically constructed to embody these characteristics [15] . The SEED resources are built upon the organization of biology into a modular set of subsystems, each describing a specific biological functionality (e.g., flagellar motility or histidine biosynthesis) [16] . Subsystems-based technologies were developed in the SEED with the view that the interpretation of one genome can be made more efficient and consistent if hundreds of genomes are simultaneously annotated in one subsystem at a time [16, 17] . The SEED Project, a multi-institutional effort coordinated by the Fellowship for Interpretation of Genomes (FIG) and Argonne National Laboratory, began with the ambitious goal of consistently annotating 1,000 genomes (http://theseed.org/wiki/ Annotating_1000_genomes); today, over 50,000 viral and prokaryotic genomes have been annotated by the subsystems technology. More recently, the SEED Project has been expanded to include the capacity to automatically generate genome-scale metabolic models based on SEED annotations of genome sequences, and the Model SEED system developed from this pipeline has now been applied to construct metabolic models for thousands of genomes [18, 19, 20] . The SEED family of resources now collectively serves as a repository for almost 5,000 distinct complete prokaryotic genomes, associated with approximately 30,000 annotations, 11,000 metabolic models, 178,000 protein families, 10,250 functional roles, and 1,060 subsystems.

While a web interface is available for visualizing the data within the SEED (http://pubseed.theseed.org), this interface is inadequate to make full effective use of the massive quantities of data now embodied within the SEED. To truly expose the SEED data for efficient large-scale use by the global scientific community, we initially developed a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) server to allow the needed programmatic access to the SEED data [21] ; however, the SOAP server could not scale up with the increased volume of data. To cope with the increasing demands placed on the SEED web services, as well as the increasing volumes of data included within the SEED resources, we developed a secondgeneration of web services to improve throughput, response time, and access to SEED functionality. Here, we describe in detail the four primary servers now available for remotely accessing SEED data and we describe the client-side distribution of server scripts that we provide as examples of how the servers may be applied to perform complex analyses of genome data.

The Servers and the Services The four servers described here, collectively referred to as the SEED servers, currently support 181 methods that can be invoked to extract data and services (Fig. 1) . The server code resides at the location of the SEED data. Users download a distribution with their choice of runtime environment that they may use to write programs to access SEED data or perform a number of common bioinformatics tasks using a supplied set of preprogrammed scripts. Currently, Perl and Java integrations are supported. The following subsections describe the four servers in more detail.

The Sapling Server offers access to the underlying integration of genomic data-including genomes, genes, proteins, annotations, subsystems, FIGfams, and co-occurrence data. On the server side, the Sapling Server accesses a database implemented by an entity-relationship data model (ERDB). The ERDB model is defined by a set of XML metadata describing the entities, relationships, and attributes in a form that can be used to generate queries as well as the documentation and an up-to-date database diagram may be viewed at http://servers.nmpdr.org/ figdisk/FIG/ErdbDocWidget.cgi?database = Sapling. Thus, the public description of the database always remains synchronized with the internal data structures-an important benefit in a database designed for public use.

The Sapling Server is architected such that new features can be added quickly. New data tables may be added as updates to the XML metadata, which is processed by a special load program to build the initial database tables. The list of services offered is maintained on the server, so that client software does not need to be updated in order for users to access new features. A web application that converts general database queries to Perl code helps speed implementation of new functions.

A database query is specified by naming the entities and relationships along a path through the ERDB diagram ( Fig. 2) along with a list of the data items to be returned and a filter clause that limits the results to the desired data objects (e.g., a particular genome or identifier). The Sapling Server allows direct queries against the database; however, a set of common data requests is implemented as direct server functions. Sapling Server functions typically accept multiple input values within a single call, allowing a client to minimize the number of requests that must be made to the server. Additional input parameters allow a client to modify the query, for example, to request that the output be in FASTA format or to ask for protein rather than DNA sequences.

In a sample ids_to_sequences request (Fig. 3A) , the user specifies four identifiers, and the server returns them as a table (actually a Perl hash) with the associated DNA sequences attached.

The Sapling Server currently supports 127 access functions. These functions are listed on a web page generated automatically from the latest version of the code, ensuring that the documentation remains up to date. A sample showing the web page description of ids_to_sequences is shown (Fig. 3B ).

The Annotation Support Server supports two distinct capabilities relating to the annotation of genomes: de novo annotation of protein or DNA sequences, and aggregation of annotations into subsystems. The Annotation Support Server accepts either DNA or protein sequence as input and, depending on the user options, can either use existing gene calls or invoke standard gene callers (e.g., GLIMMER-3 for protein-encoding genes). The server also houses newly developed high-performance methods to assign function to protein sequences or regions of genomic DNA sequences, based on FIGfams [22] . Below is an example application using these methods that produces a relatively accurate annotation of most microbial genomes within a few minutes. To evaluate the technology, users are encouraged to simply submit a known prokaryotic genome to the server for annotation.

Sequences can be submitted to the server in three ways:

1. Programs can directly access the services needed to call genes and assign functions to the proteins encoded within the genome. 2. If the protein-encoding genes have already been identified, the program can assign functions to these sequences. An example program is provided in the download library and is described at http://servers.theseed.org/sapling/server.cgi?pod=svr_assign_ using_figfams.pl.

A program can take as input fragments of DNA (e.g., from a metagenomic sample) and use the services to detect pieces of protein-encoding genes. Again, an example program is provided in the download library and is described at http://servers.theseed. org/sapling/server.cgi?pod=svr_assign_to_dna_using_figfams.pl).

The Annotation Support Server also provides the ability to take as input a set of functional roles (in the controlled vocabulary established by the subsystem collection) and to produce a detailed estimate of which subsystems are represented by those functional roles. That is, one can also use the server to develop a metabolic reconstruction based on the functional roles that have been assigned to the protein-encoding genes.

The RAST (Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology) [23] service provides access to high-throughput, high-quality annotation of prokaryotic genomes, and routinely processes ,25-75 genomes a day, with peak throughputs that have exceeded 200 genomes per day. This service is accessible for individual genome submission via a graphical web interface, and the next generation SEED servers provide new access for programmatic batch submission of genomes via the RAST submission and retrieval server. This server supports programmatic submission of genomes to the RAST Server, retrieval of job status, and retrieval of the final set of annotations. These scripts and the underlying application programming interface (API) enable users to submit genomes to the RAST Server, test the status of submitted jobs, and retrieve the output (i.e., annotated genomes).

Three types of input are supported:

1. A FASTA file of contigs that make up the genome to be annotated 2. A file of GenBank-formatted entries (with the option to retain the gene calls as given in the uploaded files)

3. An Entrez ID or a Genome Project ID.

In the case of the first type of input (FASTA file), the RAST Server will perform de novo annotation, i.e., will start by calling RNA-and protein-coding genes, and then will proceed to functional annotation, subsystems assignment, and subsequent metabolic reconstruction. In the second case (GenBank-formatted files), gene calling is optional, since GenBank-formatted files already include the coordinates for open-reading frames and RNA genes. In the last case (Entrez ID or Genome Project ID), the tools provided within the RAST Submission/Retrieval Server will query NCBI using the query ID(s) and will retrieve the sequence (whether that sequence consists of one or a set of contigs that make up the genome project); that sequence then becomes the input to the RAST Server.

The Metabolic Modeling and Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) Server provides programmatic remote access to the Model SEED biochemistry and genome-scale metabolic model database, as well as some model analysis algorithms. The Model SEED biochemistry database integrates into a single, nonredundant set all the reactions and compounds found in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database [24, 25, 26] , together with additional curated reactions and compounds [18] , and a continuously growing number of published genome-scale metabolic models.

Currently this database consists of 16,279 compounds and 13,272 reactions. For compounds, the database also includes database IDs from KEGG compounds and SEED models, names/ synonyms, molecular masses, molecular formulas, molecular charge, and estimated Gibbs free energy of formation [27] . For reactions, the database includes database IDs from KEGG reactions and SEED models, names/synonyms, stoichiometry, EC numbers, pathways, and estimated Gibbs free energy change of reactions [27] . Compound charge, formula, formation energies and reaction stoichiometry are all calculated for aqueous conditions at neutral pH. All API functions used to access the Metabolic Modeling and FBA Server capabilities are documented in detail at http://servers.theseed.org/.

The SEED database also contains a large number of genomescale metabolic models, including 14 published models [28] and approximately 11,000 models generated from the annotated genomes stored in the SEED [29] . The Metabolic Modeling and FBA Server also provides the user with an API to remotely obtain a list of the models in the SEED and to download data on the compounds and reactions in each SEED model. The server returns the following data for each reaction in a specified model: (i) all data from the SEED biochemistry database, (ii) a list of the genes associated with each reaction in the model in a format that captures how the protein products encoded by the genes function to catalyze the reaction (as either independent enzymes or multienzyme complexes), and (iii) a list of compartments in the model where the reaction takes place and the directionality/ reversibility of the reaction in each compartment. For the model compounds, the server returns the data from the SEED Figure 2 . Entities and relationships in the SEED. The entities (boxes) are connected to each other by a series of relationships (diamonds) that describe how the two entities relate. To move from one entity (e.g., ''Identifier'') to another (e.g., ''DNA Sequence''), the series of connections shown by the gray arrow is made. This way, any entity can be connected, either directly or indirectly, to any other entity. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0048053.g002 biochemistry database. As with the biochemistry data, all the model data in the server are accessible either via Perl programs or the API.

The Metabolic Modeling and FBA Server also enables users to run various FBA studies on any of the genome-scale metabolic models stored in the SEED database. These studies can be performed while simulating any of 525 distinct media conditions currently encoded in the SEED database (which includes all BiologH [30] media conditions and a variety of complex media formulations). Both the Perl program and the API enable users to obtain a list of the media conditions currently stored in the SEED and details on the compounds included in each formulation. Once a model and media condition have been selected for simulation, the server provides an interface for running three types of FBA simulation: (i) simple growth simulation to predict maximum growth rate of the organism in the selected media, (ii) flux variability analysis (FVA) [31] to classify the reactions and compounds in the model according to their behavior during growth in the selected media, and (iii) single gene knockout analysis to predict the genes essential for growth in the selected media.

The simple growth simulation returns the maximum predicted growth rate of the model given the input parameters, the predicted flux through the model reactions during maximum growth, and the predicted uptake and production of nutrients from and to the environment during maximum growth.

The FVA simulation returns the predicted class of every reaction and compound in the model during growth given the input parameters. Reactions in the model are classified as forward essential or reverse essential if they are required for growth to occur, with forward and reverse referring to the direction in which the reactions must proceed. Reactions that are not essential for growth, but still active, are classified as forward variable, reverse variable, and variable, with forward and reverse indicating when reactions proceed only in a single direction. Reactions are classified as blocked if they cannot carry flux under the conditions specified by the user. Metabolites in the model are classified as essential nutrients or essential products if their uptake or secretion is required for growth in the input conditions, and they are classified as transported if they can be taken up or secreted but are not essential for growth. In addition to classifying the reactions and compounds in the model, the FVA simulation returns the maximum and minimum values for the flux through each reactions and the uptake/secretion of each metabolite.

The single gene knockout analysis rapidly simulates the individual knockout of every gene represented in the model during growth in the input conditions. Based on these simulations, the analysis produces a list of the predicted essential genes and the predicted nonessential genes in the model. Both the Perl program and API allow the user to run any of the three simulation types from the command line.

All three simulation types accept the same user input: the name of the model to be run, the name of the media formulation that growth should be simulated in, a list of genes in the model that should be knocked out during the simulation, and a list of the reactions in the model that should be knocked out during the simulation. See http://servers.theseed.org/for detailed documentation on all Metabolic Modeling and FBA Server functions.

The SEED servers can have limitless applications. Below, we demonstrate various applications of SEED servers through a small set of potential applications and coding examples.

Dealing with IDs of genes or the proteins they encode is often nontrivial. In the SEED database, we use IDs that specify proteinencoding genes in a rapidly growing set of genomes, and we support correspondences between these IDs and those used by other annotation efforts. The SEED has two notions of equivalence: (i) two IDs that represent either protein-encoding genes or protein sequences are said to be sequence equivalent if the protein sequences are identical and (ii) two IDs that represent either exactly the same protein-encoding gene or the precise protein encoded by the gene (that is, ''the protein sequence of gene X in genome Y'') are said to be precisely equivalent. Unfortunately, in the presence of multiple versions of thousands of genomes, perfect maintenance of the ''precisely equivalent'' correspondence is virtually impossible.

Our first example script takes a command-line argument containing a single ID and produces a table for all assertions of functions for sequence equivalent IDs. Each ID in the input is associated with the name of the genome containing it, the function for that ID, the source of the functional assignment assertion, and an indication of whether the source of the assertion provided a confidence for their estimate. The code is available at http://servers.theseed.org/sapling/server. cgi?code = server_paper_example1.pl (also provided as Supporting Information S1).

Given a set of functional roles, one often wishes to understand which subsystems can be inferred from the set. The following example script reads as input a set of functional roles and constructs a table of subsystems that can be identified, along with their variation codes. The data displayed in this simple example could form the start of a research project to gather the functional roles not connected to subsystems to determine whether they were not connected because a small set of functional roles were not present in the input, and to seek candidates for such "missing functional roles." The ability to easily map functional roles into subsystems will improve as the SEED annotation effort improves its collection of encoded subsystems [32] . The code for this example is shown at http://servers.theseed.org/sapling/server. cgi?code=server_paper_example2.pl. (also provided as Supporting Information S1).

The SEED provides the ability to graphically display the chromosomal regions around a set of genes (normally from distinct genomes); for example, see http://seed-viewer.theseed.org/ seedviewer.cgi?page=Annotation&feature=fig|83333.1.peg.4. The SEED also offers an alternative for creating custom interfaces, moreover, one that does not require the user to know appropriate SEED IDs. This approach exploits the conversion capabilities of the SEED for creating a program to accept arbitrary protein IDs. It also exploits the ability of SEED to map functional roles into subsystems as described in the preceding example. The result is a tool that enables the user to take a SEED ID and a region size, and extract the genes that are found within a region centered on the designated gene. The code for this example is shown at. http://servers.theseed.org/ sapling/server.cgi?code=server_paper_example3.pl (also provided as Supporting Information S1).

A great deal has been learned from studying genes that tend to occur close to one another in diverse genomes [33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38] . In particular, the co-occurrence of hypothetical and non-hypothetical proteins can be exploited to suggest the function of the former based on the function of the latter.

The following program at http://servers.theseed.org/sapling/ server.cgi?code=server_paper_example4.pl illustrates the potential for constructing custom tools by going through all of the protein-encoding genes in all of the complete prokaryotic genomes maintained within the SEED looking for ''hypothetical proteins'' that tend to co-occur with genes encoding functions that can be connected to subsystems. The program constructs a table showing the following: This table can therefore be used to suggest functions for hypothetical proteins that could be tested experimentally. A copy of the code is provided (Supporting Information S1).

The SEED can be used to assign functions to a file of protein sequences. The code for this example is at http://servers.theseed. org/sapling/server.cgi?code=server_paper_example6.pl (also provided as Supporting Information S1).

This program reads a FASTA file of protein sequences and attempts to assign function to those sequences using a K-merbased algorithm. When a function is proposed, the program will produce a ''score'' (the number of distinct K-mers that were matched) and an estimate of phylogenetic neighborhood-a representative genome that is ''phylogenetically close'' to the genome containing the protein, if an estimate can reasonably be given.

A similar approach has been adopted for rapid, real-time analysis of metagenomics samples, which might elsewhere take days or months for BLAST-based analysis. This real-time metagenomics analysis (URL: http://edwards.sdsu.edu/rtmg) can be performed on computers or cellular phones [39] .

Here, we demonstrate how to run a variety of FBA algorithms on the SEED model of E. coli and how to print all data from the E. coli model and the results of the FBA into an output table. For the code, see http://servers.theseed.org/sapling/server. cgi?code=server_paper_example7.pl (also provided as Supporting Information S1).

The program starts by obtaining a list of all compounds and reactions in the SEED E. coli model (Seed83333.1) using the ''get_compound_id_list'' and ''get_reaction_id_list'' functions, respectively. The program then uses these lists to obtain detailed data on all the E. coli compounds and reactions (using the ''get_compound_-data'' and ''get_reaction_data'' functions, respectively). These data are stored in two tables: one for compounds and one for reactions. Next the ''classify_model_entities'' function is used to run a FVA on the SEED E. coli model. In this particular FVA, the reactions and compounds in the E. coli model are classified while simulating growth in LB media (called ArgonneLBMedia in the SEED model). At this point, the data returned by the ''classify_model_entities'' function is added onto the compound and reaction tables prepared previously. In the next step, the code uses the ''simulate_model_growth'' function to run a standard FBA on the SEED E. coli model, maximizing the model growth rate in simulated glucose minimal media (called Carbon-D-Glucose in the Model SEED). The data returned by this function are also added to the reaction and compound tables. In the final call to the server, the program uses the ''simulate_all_single_gene_knockout'' function to simulate the single knockout of all E. coli genes, and the results of this study are stored in a gene table. The remainder of the program handles the printing of the compound, reaction, and gene tables to the files CompoundTbl.txt, ReactionTbl.txt, and GeneTbl.txt, respectively.

The Gene Ontology (GO) project aims to unify biology by providing a controlled vocabulary of terms for all genes and gene products [40] , but has long had a focus on eukaryotes with less emphasis on prokaryotes and their viruses. On the other hand, the SEED database contains high quality annotations for hundreds of microbial and viral genomes, using subsystems-based controlled vocabulary. Mapping SEED functional roles to GO annotations for a given set of genes or gene products can be achieved via SEED servers. A workflow, detailed elsewhere (Short URL: http://bit.ly/server_paper_example8 ), uses two SEED serversbased programs to update SEED to GO comparisons through the use of UniProt [41, 42] protein identifiers.

The workflow consists of the following steps: 

The SEED project [15] focuses on developing technology to support rapid, high-volume, accurate annotation of genomes, and has so far achieved four advances of central importance:

1. The subsystems strategy, adopted as the guiding principle of the effort [16] , centers on leveraging expert annotations to define a small set of functional roles in all genomes rather than all the functional roles in a small number of genomes. 2. The subsystem effort provided a convenient framework for the curation of a set of protein families that became known as FIGfams [22, 23] , intended to contain only isofunctional homologsthat is, each family was intended to contain only homologous proteins playing the same functional role. When errors in FiGfams are detected, the underlying subsystems are updated and then the FIGfams are regenerated to correct those errors. The rapid evolution of the FIGfam collection has made possible a number of the services described in this article. 3. Using subsystems and FIGfams as the underlying technology, the RAST server was developed and made available in 2007 [23] . Thousands of viral and prokaryotic genomes have been annotated with the RAST system, and hundreds more are being annotated each week. 4. The high-quality annotations generated by RAST together with the ability to manually modify those annotations by human experts allowed for the automatic generation of genome-scale metabolic models in the Model SEED [18, 19, 20] .

As indicated above, the improvement in sequencing speed and efficiency led to a rapid accumulation of genome sequences and necessitated more efficient methods for large-scale access to genomes, annotations, subsystems, and genome-scale models within the SEED database. A SOAP server was first developed to allow programmatic access to the SEED data [21] , but several performance issues prevented the service from scaling with the volume of data contained within the SEED database. The server abstraction layer required the loading of numerous large modules on each invocation of server functionality, resulting in a noticeable delay in response to each server request. The encapsulation of the results in SOAP XML conferred significant overhead on the data being transferred. Finally, each operation of the SOAP server was atomic, accepting a single argument and returning a single datum. Trivial requests such as retrieving all the functions for all of the proteins in a genome took unacceptably long to complete, requiring a separate call for each protein and instantiating many threads on the server. The four SEED servers described here provide programmatic access to the SEED data and methods. They expose the current data in a form that is conveniently accessed computationally. The installation and maintenance of the client-side software require minimal effort. We have constructed the underlying methods to support relatively large-grained data transfers, allowing the construction of relatively efficient programs. In comparison to the SOAP server [21] , the new web services provide access to larger amounts of data in less time, and they have been engineered to respond to server requests with little or no server-side delay. Furthermore, the new web services provide a more efficient and flexible computing approach because they are designed to process batches of requests at a time, streaming the responses as they complete. These services provide access to the integrated genomic data, subsystems, FIGfams, co-occurrence data, annotation services, RAST annotation submission and job retrieval (thereby offering access to our continuing improvements in microbial annotation), and metabolic modeling. All client modules, code examples and documentation are available online at http:// servers.theseed.org, and we are continually expanding these services and improving the underlying documentation.

In conclusion, the SEED integration of genomic data now contains over 5,000 complete or nearly complete genomes, a constantly updated set of curated annotations embodied in a large and growing collection of encoded subsystems, and a derived set of protein families. The client-server code discussed in this article gives users easy programmatic access to the data in the SEED. It has already been successfully been used for building other applications, such as finding prophages in microbial genomes [43] , desktop-based RAST genome annotation and comparison (manuscript in preparation), and real-time annotation of metagenomes (RTMG, URL: http://edwards.sdsu.edu/rtmg [39] ). We encourage researchers to use this software to retrieve and analyze data from the SEED database and we believe that the underlying implementation of these new servers is efficient enough to address the needs of most users and we will continue providing occasional stand-alone versions of the SEED to users who need more performance or privacy.

The SEED servers project is documented and can be downloaded from the servers' web site, http://servers.theseed.org.

The Perl distribution contains the following: Client Packages.

1. The Sapling server -SAPserver.pm 2. The MODEL server -MODELserver.pm 3. The Annotation Support Server -ANNOserver.pm 4. The RAST server -RASTserver.pm

Programming using the servers. The SEED servers provide all necessary network operations in a client package that can be used to access the server functions. One uses these like any other Perl package. For instance, to find all genomes in the SEED, one does the following:

#!/usr/bin/perl w use strict; use SAPserver; my $sapObject = SAPserver-.new(); my $genomes = $sapObject-.all_genomes(); foreach my $g (sort { $genomes-.{$a} cmp $genomes-.{$b} } keys(%$genomes)) { print "$g\t$genomes-.{$g}\n"; } The function call $sapObject-.all_genomes() marshals the correct server-side function call and arguments into a network package, transmits that package to the server, waits for and retrieves the answer, processes any returned error codes, decodes the return package into a Perl data structure, and returns the result. All function calls in all the client packages perform these basic services.

The Java Distribution Contains the Following Client Packages. The org.theseed.servers.serverConnections package handles connecting to the server, transmitting and receiving the data, and converting data structures from the server into Java data structures. The classes in org.theseed.servers.servers packages handle connecting to each of the servers and making the appropriate calls.

Programming using the servers. We recommend that the code be accessed in eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org/), netbeans (http://www.netbeans.org/), or a similar graphical integrated development environment (IDE). These are used like any other class. For instance, to find all genomes in the SEED, one does the following import java.util.HashMap; import org.theseed.servers.SAPserver; public class AllGenomes { public static void main(String [35] args) { SAPserver sapling = new SAPserver(); HashMap,String, String.genomes = sapling. allGenomes(); for (String id : genomes.keySet()) System.out.

println(id + "\t"+ genomes.get(id)); } } Future directions include expanding the applications and releasing packages for use by other programming languages such as Python.

Protective Efficacy of VP1-Specific Neutralizing Antibody Associated with a Reduction of Viral Load and Pro- Inflammatory Cytokines in Human SCARB2-Transgenic Mice

Hand-foot-mouth diseases (HFMD) caused by enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus 16 (CVA16) in children have now become a severe public health issue in the Asian-Pacific region. Recently we have successfully developed transgenic mice expressing human scavenger receptor class B member 2 (hSCARB2, a receptor of EV71 and CVA16) as an animal model for evaluating the pathogenesis of enterovirus infections. In this study, hSCARB2-transgenic mice were used to investigate the efficacy conferred by a previously described EV71 neutralizing antibody, N3. A single injection of N3 effectively inhibited the HFMD-like skin scurfs in mice pre-infected with clinical isolate of EV71 E59 (B4 genotype) or prevented severe limb paralysis and death in mice pre-inoculated with 5746 (C2 genotype). This protection was correlated with remarkable reduction of viral loads in the brain, spinal cord and limb muscles. Accumulated viral loads and the associated pro-inflammatory cytokines were all reduced. The protective efficacy of N3 was not observed in animals challenged with CVA16. This could be due to dissimilarity sequences of the neutralizing epitope found in CVA16. These results indicate N3 could be useful in treating severe EV71 infections and the hSCARB2-transgenic mouse could be used to evaluate the protective efficacy of potential anti-enterovirus agent candidates.

Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a positive single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Picornavirudae family. EV71 together with Coxsackievirus 16 (CVA16), CVA5, and CVA10, are known to be major causative agents that cause mild rash symptoms called hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) in infants and children [1] . Since 1997 a significant increase of EV71 epidemics has been observed throughout the Asian-Pacific region [2] . In the 1998 EV71 outbreak in Taiwan, over 100 000 young children were infected, and approximately 400 children were hospitalized with severe pulmonary and neurogenic complications that resulted in 78 deaths [3, 4] .

Anti-EV71 viral drugs and vaccine are being developed, but their protective efficacy could not be efficiently evaluated due to lack of proper animal model. Several animal models have been developed to be EV71 infectious model using the mouse-adapted strain of EV71 [5] , innate immunodeficient mice [6] , or monkey models [7] . The intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of clinical isolate of EV71 to adult mice caused no apparent clinical symptoms. Administration of mouse-adapted EV71 strain 4643 (Tainan/ 4643/98) to 1-d-old ICR mice caused hind limb paralysis (LP) and death within 2 wk of the challenge [8] . Challenge of 1-d-old BALB/C and ICR mice infected with EV71 YN3 strain was also lethal [5] . A deficiency in type I and type II IFN receptors of the AG129 mouse cause neurological manifestations after infection with the non-mouse adapted EV71 strain (5865/SIN/00009; [6] ). The EV71 BrCr strain, an original prototype of the genotype A strain from California [9] , was demonstrated to induce neurological manifestations of tremor, ataxia, and brain edema, but no pulmonary edema (PE) and cardiac failure in cynomolgus monkeys [7] . These models are not perfect for HFMD or for neuropathogenesis caused by EV71. Viral pathogenesis in mouseadapted EV71-infected newborn suckling mice dose not mimic human infection and exhibit the restricted timeframe (up to one week old of mouse age) allowing for pathogenic challenge of EV71. In addition, innate immunity, particularly type I IFN, involved for the EV71-induced pathogenic phenotype was reported [10, 11] .

To this end, we recently have successfully developed transgenic mice carrying the known human EV71 receptor, scavenger receptor class B member 2 (SCARB2) [11, 12] . The HFMD-like skin rashes were observed in transgenic mice pre-infected with clinical isolates E59 (genotype B4 of EV71) and N2838 (B5); severe limb paralysis and death in transgenic mice pre-inoculated with clinical isolates 5746 (C2), N3340 (C4) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) [11] . EV71 viral loads in the tissues and CNS accompanied the upregulated pro-inflammatory mediators (CXCL10, CCL3, TNF-a, and IL-6), correlating to recruitment of the infiltrated T lymphocytes that resulted in severe diseases in transgenic mice [11] . It was also observed in EV71 patients with encephalitis associated with PE that have a higher mortality rate (64.3%) than patients with brainstem encephalitis (26.3%) [13, 14] , PE might be caused by increased pulmonary vascular permeability resulting from brainstem lesions caused by the excessive release of IL-6, TNF-a, IL-1b, and IFN-c [13, 15, 16] . In this study, we investigate whether the hSCARB2-transgenic mouse model could be suitable for evaluating the protective efficacy conferred by a previously described EV71-specific neutralizing antibody, N3 [17] . Administration of N3 to transgenic mice reduced the developed hair loss and scurfy skin as well as limb paralysis induced by E59 infection and protected from severe limb paralysis resulting in death by 5746 infection. This protection associates with the reduction of the viral load in the brain, spinal cords, and limb muscles. It also associated with the reduction of the secreted proinflammatory mediators in tissues. These results demonstrated N3 might have potential to serve as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of EV71-induced severely HFMD patients.

To assess the capabilities of cross-neutralization of N3 against genotype B4-and C2 strains of EV71, various concentrations of N3 (beginning with 50 mg) were incubated with either E59 (B4) or 5746 (C2) before infecting NIH3T3 cells constituting expressed human SCARB2 (3T3-SCARB2) [18] . The viral genomes in infected 3T3-SCARB2 cells were detected by RT-PCR reaction using primers specifically targeting to VP1 sequence of P1 transcripts of E59 or 5746 isolates. The results show that N3 inhibited the expression of P1 of E59 and 5746 in a concentrationdependent manner. The quantities of the expressed P1, compared to the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were shown in a bar graph in Fig. 1 .

To further investigate the protective efficacy of N3 antibodies against EV71 infection in vivo, 1-day old hSCARB2-transgenic mice were preinfected with 1610 7 pfu of E59 subcutaneously (s.c.) followed by administration of N3 or isotype antibody (200 mg) i.p. for 3 h post infection. Mice were monitored for sign development on a daily basis. Mice treated with isotype antibody exhibited visible hair loss associated with scurfy skin peaked on Day 6 post infection, and the skin scurf/rash gradually disappeared after Day 7 post infection. Administration of N3 to E59-preinfected mice reduced the skin lesions to a relatively mild degree from Day 4 post infection onwards ( Figs. 2A and 2B) . Moreover, prechallenge of 7-day old hSCARB2-transgenic mice with a lethal dose of 1610 5 pfu 5746 [11] caused progressive limb paralysis from Day 4 onwards and led to death if the mice remained untreated or isotype antibody treated (Figs. 3A and 3B). Mice receiving N3 treatment 3 h post infection were protected from the development of paralysis and were subsequently rescued from lethal infection.

To investigate whether the schedule of N3 treatment is ideal for protecting from EV71 infection in vivo, 7-day old hSCARB2transgenic mice were preinfected s.c. with a lethal dose of 1610 5 pfu of 5746 followed by a single dose injection of 200 mg N3 at 3, 24, or 48 h post EV71 infection, or followed by 2 doses of N3 injection (first shot at 48 h post infection followed by another 24 h later), or a low dose of N3 (70 mg) was given at 3 h post infection to examine the protection capacity. An isotype antibody was given at the same concentration (200 mg) as control in this study (Fig. 4) . It was found that the mice had a better survival rate correlating to a shorter time interval of N3 administration post EV71 infection; mice were fully protected when given one dose of 

The pathology of EV71-infected mice treated with N3 was examined by immunohistochemical and histological staining. Mice were given 200 mg N3 or isotype antibodies at 3 h post 1610 5 pfu of 5746 infection. The antibody-treated animals were sacrificed and tissue sections were prepared on Day 4 after infection. No marked lesions or inflammation were observed in the brain, spinal cord, skin, heart, spleen, lungs, or liver (data not shown) of infected mice received N3 treatment. In immunochemistry staining with anti-EV71 antibody, viral particles did not accumulated in the brainstem (Fig. 5A ) and muscles (Fig. 5B ) of mice treated with N3, in contrast to the marked accumulation in the these tissue of mice which did not receive treatment or received only isotype antibody. The muscle fibers were damaged in the non-treated mice and mice received isotype antibody but were not observed in the tissues from the mice received N3, compared to the section of normal muscle tissue (MOCK) (Fig. 5B ). Our previous study had showed that microvilli in the inner layer of the small intestine of transgenic mice would be completely destroyed after EV71 infection [11] . To investigate whether the EV71-induced pathogenesis in the intestine can be inhibited by N3 or not, histopathological stains of the intestine tissue on Day 8 post infection was performed. The result showed that the intestine from the mice received N3 was no damage, compared to massive destruction of the mucosa and microvilli in antibody-untreated or isotype antibody-treated mice (Fig. 5C ).

To examine the viral load of EV71 in the tissues of mice while treated with N3, we isolated RNA from the different organs from 5746-infected mice on Day 6 post infection and then quantified EV71 transcripts using real-time RT-PCR. We noticed that administration of N3 reduced viral expression significantly in the brain, spinal cord, muscle, skin, and the intestine (Fig. 6 ). We also confirmed that CNS-and limb muscle-tropism of EV71 viremia occurred in this model [11] .

Upregulation of CXCL10 and CCL3 in the CNS and peripheral tissues after virulent 5746 infection in transgenic mice was reported by our previous works. This is also corresponds to the clinical findings where CXCL10 increased in patients with EV71 [19] . Higher expression of CCL3 observed in the CNS of transgenic mice infected with EV71 may contribute to the recruitment of granulocytes (neutrophils) during inflammation in the brain. Cytokine storm is thus proposed to cause severe symptoms. Administration of Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) which suppresses cytokine production has been used to treat severe cases [13] [14] [15] 20] . We measured the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in the tissues of 5746-infected mice while receiving N3. Quantitative RT-PCR to the specific cytokines showed that CXCL10 expression was significantly reduced in brainstem, spinal cord, and limb muscle after N3 treatment (Fig. 7A ). CCL3 expression was reduced in the brain and limb muscle (Fig. 7B ).

Interestingly, elevated IL-6 was shown in the spinal cord but not brainstem or muscle of infected mice (untreated group vs. isotypetreated group). Treatment of N3 effectively reduced the elevated IL-6 expression in the spinal cord and even reduced the basal level of IL-6 in the muscle (Fig. 7C ). These chemokines downregulated markedly in CNS and limb muscle indicated that treatment with N3 at an early stage of 5746 infection hindered viral-induced pathogenesis, and might affect the lymphocyte infiltration in the inflammatory tissues.

Similar scenarios were seen in the secretion of type I and type II interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brainstem, spinal cord, and muscle. Elevated IFN-a (muscle), IFN-b (brainstem, spinal cord, and muscle), and IFN-c (brainstem and muscle) responding to the innate immunity against virus infection were downregulated in transgenic mice that received N3 after infection in contrast to non-treated or isotype antibody-treated mice (Fig. 8 ). Expression of TNF-a in three tissues and IL-1b in the brainstem and muscle of transgenic mice were also suppressed significantly (Fig. 9 ). These results indicate that N3 protects mice from developing pathogenesis caused by EV71 infection. Administration of N3 did not Protect hSCARB2-transgenic Mice from Coxsackie Virus A16 Infection

In addition to the two genotypes of EV71, we also examined whether N3 could protect hSCARB2-transgenic mice from Coxsackie virus A16 (CVA16) infection. One dose of early N3 administration after CVA16 infection significantly prolonged survival but did not rescue the mice from developing neurological syndromes which eventually led to death (Fig. S1 ). This result could be explained by the result of weaker cross-neutralization of N3 against CVA16 (Fig. S2 ). Indeed, N3 was able to recognize CVA16 virions that was evident by evaluating the binding of N3 with CVA16 using ELISA (for naïve protein interaction; Fig. S3 ) and Western blot (for denatured protein interaction; Fig. S4 ). In contrast to highly binding to two EV71 strains, N3 showed lower affinity to naïve CVA16 (Fig. S3) . Oppositely, anti-CVA16 antisera, obtained from mice immunized twice with live CVA16, equally detected all EV71 virus and CVA16 particles as depicted in Fig. S4 . N3 recognizes the VP1 proteins of both B4 and C2 EV71 at approximately 35 kDa [17, 21] and the VP0 of CVA16 at approximately 50 kDa [22] that is different from anti-CVA16 antisera which detected similar capsid protein patterns among both EV71 and CVA16 isolates with highlighted VP3 at approximately 26 kDa.

Although ICR-and BALB/C-suckling mice were reported to be susceptible to genotype C of EV71 infection to induce neurological pathology using a mouse-adapted but not clinically isolated virus in these experiments [8, [23] [24] [25] or using the natural strain of EV71 in type I/II interferon-deficient newborn mice [6] . The lack of a relevant animal model has hampered the development of effective prophylactic and therapeutic approaches. Previously, We had developed and demonstrated that challenge of newborn hSCARB2-transgenic mice with B genotypes of EV71 isolates, the early syndrome of HFMD, followed by progressively neurological LP were developed. In addition, hSCARB2-transgenic mice elicit more susceptibility than the reported newborn mouse models for C genotype of EV71 infection which resulted in lethal neurological diseases. Despite the muscle-tropic EV71 viremia in the reported model that differ from the CNS-tropism of EV71 infection in humans, hSCARB2-transgenic mice were characterized as bi-pathological tropism in the CNS and peripheral sites [11] .

Passive transfer of protective antibodies has been shown to reduce the severity of viral infections, including Japanese encephalitis [26] , varicella [27] and coxsackievirus infection [28] . Previously, we generated 4 murine monoclonal antibodies that cross-neutralized subgenogroup B isolates of EV71 in vitro. Therefore, we tested the protective efficacy of the neutralizing monoclonal antibody N3 in a reliable model. Here we show that by using N3, hSCARB2-transgenic mice infected by either genotypes B or C of EV71 viruses were protected from developing HFMD-like and paralytic symptoms. We concluded that treatment of N3 (200 mg) at an early stage (3 h post infection) after infection afforded complete protection. A lower dose (70 mg) of N3 treatment at an early stage provided 90% protection. The protection efficacy dropped when N3 was provided at 24 h post infection, even though the multiple administrations of N3 did not rescue the mice from pathogenesis. This suggested that the protection conferred by N3 is in a dose and time-dependent manner.

Several large epidemics of severe forms of EV71 infection in young children are associated with neurological diseases that may occasionally cause permanent paralysis or death [29] [30] [31] . In our study, we showed that N3 protected hSCARB2-transgenic mice from being infected (Fig. 4) ; viral load from different tissues (CNS and muscle) of N3-treated hSCARB2-transgenic mice was markedly reduced in contrast to non-treated groups (Fig. 5-6 ). These results indicate that the reduction of viral load in the compartment of CNS by N3 may correlate to the protection. Indeed, several studies of people and mice have also suggested the possibility of EV71-induced immunopathogenesis [19, 32] . Clinical, radiological, and laboratory features indicated that immunpathology resulting in neurological disease were reported in severe cases [33] . Elevated levels of several cytokines and chemokines have been reported in children with brainstem encephalitis and PE [13, 15] . CXCL10, CCL3, IL-6, TNF-a, IL-1b, and Type 1 and type II IFNs were found to be significantly elevated in EV71infected hSCARB2-transgenic mice. After N3 treatment, reduction of proinflammatory mediators release was observed (Fig. 7, 8 , 9) . Moreover, similar results were reported in clinical cases that IFN-c, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-13 levels in the blood were significantly decreased in EV71 patients with PE after administration of IVIG. Beside EV71, coxsackievirus-induced myocarditis is primarily attributed to viremic injury, and immune infiltration and reclamation [34, 35] . Both innate immune response and specific host effector mechanisms were also reported to be involved in the CNS of coronavirus infection [36] .

Collectively, our results show that previously generated EV71 B4 genotype monoclonal antibody, which targeted VP1 linear epitope VC43 and neutralized subgenogroups B4 and B5 strains of EV71 in vitro [17] , was also able to cross-protect genotype C virus infection in vitro (Fig. 1 ) and in hSCARB2-transgenic mouse model. N3 conferred protection through the reduction of viral load and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines that contributed to viremic injury and immunopathogenesis.

In contrast to the protection of N3 against the infection of EV71 in hSCARB3-transgenic mice, administration of the same amount of antibody did not protect hSCARB3-transgenic mice from lethal CVA16 infection. Investigation of the affinity of N3 against CVA16 showed lower reactivity. We have identified that N3 specifically recognized a VP1 epitope (210-225 amino acid of VP1 region or named 776-790 encoded residues of EV71 genome; [17] ). In comparison of the recent study [37] , alignment of the highly conserved region of VP1 amino acid (200-225) sequences from different EV71 genotypes and CVA16 showed dissimilarity between CVA16 and EV71, which may explain the scenario that N3 failed to cross-neutralize CVA16 was due to the different sequence. The epitope recognized by N3 is also different from the previous report's epitopes; the mouse anti-sera generated from the peptides, P230-323, P646-755, P857-1012 and P1329-1440, showed strong staining with neuron plasma in both adult human cerebra and fetus medulla. N3 only closely met with the peptide P746-876 which elicits weak cross-reactivity to human tissues [38] .

In conclusion, we have researched the evidence to demonstrate the cross-protection efficacy of N3 in hSCARB2-transgenic mice which show greater susceptibility to natural strains B and C in orchestrating HFMD and CNS-like syndromes and may break through the limitation of current suckling model applications that can prolong the time frame of mice age for the diseases induction especially a unique HLS syndrome [11] . This model might serve as an experimental model for aiding the evaluation of anti-EV71 therapeutic medicine. The application of humanized monoclonal antibodies to control various viral infections was reported [39, 40] . Therefore, humanized N3 is expectable to serve as therapeutic agent to treat HFMD diseases in the future. It is also of interest to further evaluate whether CVA16 could elicit cross-neutralizing antibodies against different EV71 genotypes in this model.

All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Laboratory Animal Center of the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI), Taiwan. The animal-use protocols were reviewed and approved by the NHRI Institutional Figure 6 . N3 inhibited viral loads of the tissues from hSCARB2-transgenic mice preinfected with EV71 5746. 7-day old hSCARB2transgenic mice were challenged with 1610 5 pfu of 5746 and followed by receiving 200 mg N3 or isotype antibodies at 3 h post infection. Infected mice received no antibody were included. On day 6 post infection, mice were sacrificed and RNAs were extracted from the brainstem, spinal cord, muscle, skin, and intestine for quantitative RT-PCR using primers specific to VP1 region of P1 transcripts. Virus copy numbers were calculated using a standard curve shown by purified EV71. A schematic representation of the virus copy number and the statistical average from 11 mice per group is shown. The unpaired student t test with Welch correction was used for statistical analysis. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0069858.g006

Animal Care and Use Committee (Approved protocol no. NHRI-IACUC-101006-A). 5746-TW98 (C2) strain elicits a lethal neurological virulence of hind limb paralysis (HLP) and E59 (B4) can induce HFMD-like hair loss associated with scurf (HLS) and a non-lethal HLP in hSCARB2-transgenic mice [11] . In the protection of C2 EV71challenge, survival rate was used as one of end points to assess the protective efficacy of anti-EV71 medication. Survival rate used as an index of pathogenesis of EV71 infection in experimental animal models has been reported by many studies [5, 6, 8, 11] . In B4 challenge test, scoring of mice with HLS and HLP was performed. After the investigation or when weight loss of 20% occurred, tested animals were euthanasia by 100% CO2 inhalation for 5 minutes followed by cervical dislocation to minimize the animals suffering. To perform virus challenge, mice were explored in the anesthetic inhalator chamber containing isoflurane (For initial phase: 5%, for maintainced phase: 1.5%,2.5%) for 1 minutes before subcutaneously or intraperitoneally immunized with EV71 or antibody, respectively.

The clinically isolated strains of EV71, genotype B4 of E59 (GenBank: GQ150746.1), was obtained from the Taiwan Centers for Diseases Control (CDC). Genotype C2 of 5746-TW98 (5746; GenBank: AF304457.1), B4 of N0781-TW-01, B5 of N2838-TW-03 (GenBank: DQ008993.1) and one strain of CVA16, 5079 (GenBank: AF177911.1) were provided by Professor Jen-Ren Wang, Department of Medical Technology, National Chen Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan. Viruses were propagated in Vero cells and purified as previously described [41, 42] .

EV71-neutralizing monoclonal antibody N3 was produced in ascetic fluid and purified as previously described [17] . The specificity of N3 was checked against E59 by western blot. Commercial mouse IgG2a isotype antibody (eBioscience, CA, USA) was used as the control.

A PCR-based neutralization assay was adopted and performed according to Pittlot et al. [43] to evaluate the cross-neutralization Figure 7 . Administration of N3 reduced pro-inflammatory chemokines expression in CNS and muscle tissues of 5746-preinfected hSCARB2-transgenic mice. RNAs were extracted from the brain, spinal cord, and muscle of 5746-infected 7-day old hSCARB2-transgenic mice treated with N3 or isotype antibody, and antibody-untreated mice as described in Fig. 6 and were subjected to quantitative RT-PCR specific to (A) CXCL10, (B) CCL3, and (C) IL-6. The number of PCR cycles (Ct) required for fluorescent detection of target genes was calculated and presented as the relative expression after normalization with the internal control of b-actin expression from the same tissue. Each normalized 2 Ct value was the ratio to the value from the mean of 2 Ct obtained from the antibody-untreated tissues. A schematic representation of the target gene expression and the statistical average from 10 mice per group is shown. Unpaired student t test with Welch correction was used for statistical analysis. (*p, = 0.05, **p, = 0.01). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0069858.g007 of N3 against both genotypes B and C of EV71 viruses. Serial diluted N3 (10 mg/mL) were incubated with EV71 genotype B or C viruses (m.o.i. = 0.5) at 37uC for 1 h. The mixtures were then inoculated into a monolayer of the 3T3-SCARB2 cell line in a 6well plate at 37uC for 2 h. After absorption, the cells were washed 3 times in PBS and RNA was extracted using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, CA, USA) following instructions provided by the manufacturer. Two sets of sense and antisense synthetic oligonucleotide primers were used for the detection of EV71 genotype B and C viruses. The primer sequences used to amplify genome expending from VP1 domain of the B4 and C2 virus were 59-AGAGAGTCACTTGCTTGGCAGACA-39 (B4_F), and 59-AC-GACTAGTGCCGGTCGGTTTAAT-39 (B4_R); 59-GCTAGT-GATATCCTACAGACAGGC-39 (C2_F), 59-GGACTGCTGTCCAAATTTCCCGAG-39 (C2_R), respectively. The PCR was performed with a total reaction volume of 50 ml containing 2 ml of cDNA, 16 the PCR buffer with 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0.2 mM (each) of deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 0.2 mM of each primer, and 2 U of FastStart Taq polymerase (Roche, IN, USA). Amplification was conducted according to the following cycling program: denaturation at 95uC for 4 min, annealing at 52uC (B4) or 57uC (C2) for 30 s and elongation at 72uC for 3 min for 40 cycles followed by a final extension at 72uC for 7 min, all of which were performed in a 96-well Veriti Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystem, MA, USA). The PCR products were then separated by electrophoresis in a 1.2% agarose gel containing SYBRH Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen, NY, USA) and visualized by ultraviolet light.

The hSCARB2-transgemic mice were bred and maintained as previously described [11] . Both 1-day and 7-day old mice were inoculated with 1610 7 pfu of live E59 and 3610 5 pfu live 5746 virus isolates subcutaneously (s.c.). For protection studies, the purified neutralizing monoclonal antibody N3 (20 ml of 10 mg/ mL) were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) into the mice after 3, 24, and 48 h after infection. Mice were observed for symptom development for 10 days post virus infection. The severity of HFMD-like and paralysis symptoms was scored from 0 to 5 using the following criteria: For HFMD-like symptoms 5 = 80% hair loss associated with scurf (white spots) (HLS), 4 = 50% HLS, 3 = .30% HLS, 2 = .10% HLS, 1 = ,10% HLS and 0 = no HLS on the back and abdomen. To score the degree of paralysis, 5 = severe RNA was extracted from the brain, spinal cord, and muscles of 5746-infected 7-day old hSCARB2-transgenic mice treated with N3 or isotype antibody, and antibody-untreated mice as described in Fig. 4 and were subjected to quantitative RT-PCR specific to (A) IFN-a, (B) IFN-b, and (C) IFN-c. The relative expression of target gene normalized with the internal control of b-actin expression from the same tissue was calculated as described in Fig.  7 . Unpaired student t test with Welch correction was used for statistical analysis. (*p, = 0.05, **p, = 0.01). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0069858.g008 paralyzed front and rear limbs with no movement, 4 = 2 rear limbs were moderately paralyzed with difficulty in movement, 3 = paralyzed rear limbs with bending legs, 2 = mildly bending rear limbs, 1 = slightly bending rear limbs, 0 = no paralyzed limbs with normal movement. The tested animals were euthanized by 100% CO2 inhalation for 5 minutes followed by cervical dislocation after completion of the experimental protocol or when weight loss of 20% occurred (according to the guidelines of approved animal-use protocols; protocol no. NHRI-IACUC-101006-A).

One-way ANOVA with the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the results obtained from different groups with HLS or paralysis symptoms. An unpaired student t test with Welch correction was used to evaluate the statistical differences of the RNA expression levels between the groups. The log-rank test was used to evaluate differences in survival. A p-value ,0.05 was considered statistically significant. The symbol * and ** were used to indicate p-values ,0.05 and ,0.01, respectively. These tests were performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 for Windows.

Immunhistochemistry (IHC) was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections as previously described [11] . EV71 viral particles were detected using a murine anti-EV71 monoclonal antibody (Chemicon International) followed by visualization using a DAB PLUS substrate kit (Zymed Laboratories). Histopathological H/E staining was conducted in the Pathology Core Facility of the National Health Research Institute, Taiwan. Specimens were observed using a Olympus BX51 Research Microscope (model BX51TRF, Olympus, Japan). Pictures were managed using a DP controller provided by the same company.

Tissues from specific organs were collected in tubes containing 0.5 mL of TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA) and ceramic beads (Bertin Technologies, Montigny le Bretonneux, France) followed by homogenization using Precellys 24 homogenizer (Bertin Technologies, Montigny le Bretonneux, France). RNAs were then extracted using TRIZOL reagent following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The purity of the isolated RNAs was examined using a spectrophotometer with an A260/A280 absorbance ratio. The cDNA synthesis was performed using a Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche, IN, USA) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. One microgram of RNA was mixed with 60 mM of random hexamer primers and denatured at 65uC for 10 min before adding 16 transcriptor reverse transcriptase reaction buffer, 2 0U of RNase inhibitor, 1 mM of deoxynucleotide mix, Figure 9 . N3 downregulated TNF-a and IL-1b in CNS and muscle tissues of 5746-infected hSCARB2-transgenic mice. RNA was extracted from the brain, spinal cord, and muscles of 5746-infected 7-day old hSCARB2-transgenic mice treated with N3 or isotype antibody, and antibody-untreated mice as described in Fig. 4 and were subjected to quantitative RT-PCR specific to (A) TNF-a and (B) IL-1b. The relative expression of target gene normalized with the internal control of b-actin expression from the same tissue was calculated as described in Fig. 7 . Unpaired student t test with Welch correction was used for statistical analysis. (*p, = 0.05, **p, = 0.01). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0069858.g009 and 1 0U of reverse transcriptase at 55uC for 30 min followed by 85uC for 5 min. The resulting cDNAs were then subjected to quantitative real-time PCR analysis with EV71 VP1 specific primers. Mouse actin genes in the samples were used as the internal control. To evaluate the expression of cytokine and chemokine genes of different tissues, specified primer pairs were used for the detection of CXCL10, CCL3, IL-6, TNF-a, INF-a, IFN-b, and IL-1b. The sequences of primer pairs specific to the target genes were the same as previously noted in [11] . To determine the expression of IFN-c, Taqman assay was performed using specific primers 59-TCAAAAGAGTTCCT-TATGTGCCTA-39 (Forward) and 59-TACGAGGACGGA-GAGCTGTT-39 (Reverse) and the probe No.69 from Universal Probe Library (Cat. No. 04688686001, Roche). Maxima probe/ ROX qPCR Master Mix (2X) (Cat. No. K02331, Thermo Scientific) was used following the program and procedures provided by the manufacturer. All primer sets were synthesized commercially by Mission Biotech, Taiwan. The optical density reading of N3 against naïve EV71 genotypes showed high affinity on E59 which was used to raise the antibody. The affinities of N3 on EV71 5746 and CVA16 were reduced. However mouse anti-CVA16 antisera showed similar affinity on detection of these virions. Isotype antibody was also included as background control. (TIF) Figure S4 Protein analysis profiles of N3 and mouse anti-CVA16 on different EV71 genotypes and CVA16. Purified and concentrated EV71 and CVA16 were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane for Western blotting with N3 (A), mouse anti-CVA16 antisera (B) or isotype antibody (C). (A) N3 detected VP1 proteins at approximately 35 kDa from both genotypes of EV71 [17, 37] and the VP0 of CVA16 at approximately 50 kDa [39] . (B) anti-CVA16 antisera detected similar capsid protein patterns among both EV71 and CVA16 isolates with highlighted VP3 at approximately 26 kDa. (C) Isotype antibody did not detect any protein from both EV71 genotypes and CVA16. (TIF)

Measles infection causing Bacillus Calmette-Guérin reactivation: a case report

Background: Reactivation of the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), manifesting as erythema, induration, ulceration or crust formation at a previous BCG inoculation site, is a common and highly specific feature of Kawasaki disease (KD). We report the unusual finding of BCG reactivation in an infant with laboratory-confirmed measles. Case presentation: A previously healthy 7-month old infant presented initially with fever, cough and coryza, and subsequently developed Koplik's spots followed by a typical morbilliform skin rash. There was significant contact history with a household relative who had recently been diagnosed with measles. On examination, a 2.5 cm area of erythema and induration was seen at the previous BCG inoculation site, in addition to the widespread maculopapular rash. No other clinical features of KD were present. Measles virus was isolated from the throat swab and measles antibodies (IgM) were present in the serum. The patient recovered completely with oral vitamin A and supportive therapy, and had normal echocardiography examination on follow up. Conclusions: This case report highlights the rare finding of BCG reactivation in a child with confirmed measles infection, and suggests that this clinical manifestation may occasionally occur in children with infections or conditions other than KD.

Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is used to prevent tuberculous meningitis, miliary tuberculosis and possibly other forms of tuberculosis, including pulmonary disease, in children [1, 2] . It is included as part of the expanded programme on immunization in over 150 countries worldwide, including Malaysia [3] . In Malaysia, as in most countries where it is used, BCG vaccination is recommended universally for all infants at birth or shortly after birth. Following intradermal inoculation of the attenuated Mycobacterium bovis BCG strain at the deltoid region of the left arm, a small papule usually appears after 2 weeks, gradually enlarges and typically ulcerates within 2-4 months, and slowly heals over the next few months to form the BCG scar [4] .

Reactivation of the BCG, manifesting as erythema, induration, ulceration or crust formation at the BCG site months or years after inoculation, has been described as an important feature of Kawasaki disease (KD) [5, 6] .

Although not included in the diagnostic criteria of the disease, this clinical manifestation is reported in up to 50% of children with KD [7] . In addition, the clinical finding of BCG reactivation is regarded to be highly specific for KD, as it is very rarely described in other febrile illnesses or infections. For example, in a study of febrile Japanese children aged < 2 years admitted over an 8month period with diagnoses other than KD, no BCG reactivations were observed [8] . In contrast, data from a Japanese nationwide epidemiologic survey showed that > 70% of children in this age group who were diagnosed with KD developed BCG reactivation [8] . Measles infection has not been reported to cause BCG reactivation.

Here, we present a case report of a 7-month old infant with laboratory-confirmed measles who presented with erythema and induration at the BCG inoculation site.

A 7-month old boy was admitted to the paediatric ward of Bintulu Hospital in Sarawak with a 4-day history of fever and 1 day of rash. His past medical history had been unremarkable and he had been thriving well. He had received BCG vaccination (BCG-Japan, Tokyo 172 strain) at birth, at the same hospital. According to his mother, a papule had developed at the inoculation site which had then healed completely to form a scar in the months prior to the admission. He had not received measles vaccination.

His illness began abruptly with high fever, cough and coryza, for which he received symptomatic treatment as an outpatient at a private medical centre during the first 2 days after disease-onset. On the third day, his condition worsened as he fed poorly and was noted to have reduced activity, with persistence of the fever. A detailed history was then taken and revealed that the child's uncle, who lives with the family and had never received measles vaccination, had been admitted to the same medical centre 2 weeks earlier with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of measles. Physical examination of the child revealed Koplik's spots and he was then admitted to the medical centre. Later that day, he developed a typical morbilliform rash which began behind the ears and neck, and spread to his face and trunk. The following day, he was referred to our hospital with a clinical diagnosis of measles.

On admission, he looked unwell, was febrile (temperature 38.5°C) but had normal vital signs (pulse rate 125/min, respiratory rate 48/min). He had an erythematous maculopapular rash involving mainly the face, neck and trunk, with some areas of confluence (Fig. 1a) . In addition, a welldefined erythematous, indurated area measuring 2.5 cm in diameter was seen at the site of the BCG scar (Fig. 1b) . No conjunctivitis, cervical node enlargement, mucosal changes or extremity changes (swelling/erythema of the hands or feet) were found.

Laboratory investigations revealed a mild anaemia (haemoglobin 10.9 g/dL) with normal white blood cell (6.5 X 10 9 cells/L) and platelet counts (252 X 10 9 /L). Both the C-reactive protein (< 6 mg/dL) and the erythrocyte sedimentary rate (10 mm/hour) were normal. Other investigations including liver function tests (albumin 42 g/L; aspartate aminotransferase 41 U/L; alanine aminotransferase 17 U/L) and urine microscopy were also normal. Blood for bacterial culture was negative. A throat swab and urine sample for measles virus isolation, as well as serum for measles antibodies were sent to the regional laboratory.

He was treated with oral vitamin A and intra-venous fluids. His condition began to improve on day 6 of illness, with a resolution of the fever and improvement in feeding and activity. By the 7th day of illness, both the generalized rash as well as the BCG inoculation site erythema and induration appeared to be resolving, leaving some hyperpigmentation (Fig. 1c, d) . He was then discharged home.

Follow-up revealed a healthy and thriving boy. No skin desquamation was noted. Echocardiography at 2 and 10 weeks after discharge were normal. A review of the investigation results from the regional laboratory confirmed the diagnosis of measles, with measles virus isolated from the patient's throat swab and measles-specific antibodies (IgM) present in the serum. Isolation of measles virus from the throat swab was performed using Vero/hSLAM cell lines. Typical cytopathic effect was observed as formation of syncytia, which appeared as large multinucleated cells (giant cells). The cultures were then harvested and the presence of measles virus confirmed by an immunofluorescence assay (Chemicon International, Temecula, USA). Measles-specific antibodies (IgM) in the serum were detected by an indirect enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) using a commercially available test kit (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products GmbH, Marburg, Germany).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report to describe BCG reactivation in a child with confirmed measles infection. A search of the PubMed/MEDLINE database using the key terms "Bacillus Calmette-Guérin", "Bacille Calmette-Guérin", "BCG" and "measles" revealed no reports of similar cases in the published literature. Although the detection of BCG inoculation site erythema and induration did prompt a thorough investigation for KD in our patient, diagnostic criteria for the disease was not met. All clinical and laboratory findings were however consistent with the diagnosis of measles, and a complete and rapid recovery ensued with supportive therapy.

The diagnosis of measles in the patient was confirmed by both measles virus isolation from the throat swab and also detection of measles-specific antibodies (IgM) in the serum. Having been exposed to an unvaccinated relative who had laboratory-confirmed measles, the patient, a 7-month old infant, then developed the classical manifestations and progressed through the typical natural history of measles infection, without developing any other complications. Measles infection is caused by measles virus, a Morbillivirus in the family paramyxoviridae [9] . The disease remains an important childhood affliction, causing 89 780 deaths globally in 2016, despite the availability of an effective vaccine [10] . In Malaysia, measles vaccination is given to infants aged 9months. With a vaccination coverage of 94% in 2016, the incidence of measles in Malaysia was reported to be 5.0 per 100,000 population while the mortality rate from measles was 0.02 per 100,000 population [11] . Although the diagnosis is usually made based on the characteristic clinical manifestations, confirmation of measles infection may be obtained by detection of measles specific IgM antibodies in the serum, and also through measles virus identification from throat-swab and urine specimens [12] .

Other than fever, the rash and the BCG inoculation site erythema and induration, no other features of KD were present in the patient. The clinical symptoms and signs resolved without KD specific therapy, with no coronary artery complications detected on follow up. KD is an acute vasculitic syndrome of unknown etiology, occurring mainly in children [13] . As there are no confirmatory tests, the diagnosis of KD is made based on the presence of fever lasting for 5 days or more, and 4 of 5 principal clinical criteria that include conjunctivitis without exudates, cervical lymphadenopathy, polymorphous rash, changes in the lips or oral mucosa, and changes of the extremities [13] . A major challenge in the diagnosis and management of KD, however, is the recognition that some infants present with only 2-3 clinical features, and therefore do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria. Laboratory investigations may be of some use in this situation of incomplete KD [13] . BCG reactivation has repeatedly been described as an important sign in incomplete KD, although it is not included in any of the diagnostic algorithms [14, 15] . For example, in South Korea, 85% of children aged < 1 year who were diagnosed with incomplete KD had erythema, induration or crust formation at the BCG inoculation site [16] . The unexpected finding of BCG reactivation in our patient correctly raised the concern of a possible diagnosis of incomplete KD. Although echocardiography was not performed in the initial phase, no additional supporting clinical or laboratory criteria, other than mild anemia, were found. Reassuringly, the rapid resolution of symptoms precluded any further concerns with regard to the need for KD therapy in the patient.

Apart from those to confirm the measles infection, no laboratory investigations were undertaken to determine if additional viral pathogens were present in the patient and contributed to the development of the BCG reactivation. Human herpes virus 6 infection has been reported in an infant with a viral exanthem presenting with BCG reactivation [17] . In addition, various respiratory viruses including enterovirus, adenovirus, human rhinovirus and coronavirus have been isolated significantly more frequently in children with KD than in controls [18] , although no direct association with BCG reactivation have been documented. As viral co-infections have been identified in children with measles [19] , a more extensive virology work-up may have been warranted in our patient when the unusual finding of BCG reactivation was discovered.

The mechanism leading to the BCG reactivation in our patient with measles is not known. One possible mechanism is the reactivation and multiplication of live but dormant Mycobacterium bovis BCG bacilli that may have been present at the inoculation site, facilitated by immune suppression induced by measles infection. In one previous case report, a severely malnourished 2.5year old boy developed ulceration of a healed BCG scar and possible disseminated BCG infection 2 weeks after measles infection [20] . Acid-fast bacilli was detected from a swab of the BCG ulcer. This mechanism is, however, unlikely in our patient in view of the rapid onset and resolution of the BCG site erythema/induration with the appearance and resolution of the measles rash. Immune suppression induced by measles would normally be expected to persist for a longer duration [21] . In addition, the lack of malnutrition in the patient, the otherwise uncomplicated measles course, and the absence of secondary infections normally seen in severe immunosuppressed states further renders this mechanism unlikely. Another possible mechanism for the BCG reactivation, which appears more probable, is an immune-mediated reaction. Cross-reactivity between specific epitopes of mycobacterial and human heat shock proteins (HSP), in particular mycobacterial HSP 65 and human homologue HSP 63, have been postulated as the cause of BCG reactivation in children with Kawasaki disease [22, 23] . HSP are ubiquitous molecules present in all organisms, including humans, and mediate important functions in protein folding, assembly and transport essential for cell survival [24] . Synthesis of HSP are increased during conditions of cellular stress, including infection, ischaemia and other physical stresses. In humans, increased production and serum concentrations of HSP, especially HSP 70, have been reported during viral infections, including measles [25, 26] . As homology between HSP 70 and mycobacterial antigens have been demonstrated [27] , a similar cross-reactivity as thought to occur in children with Kawasaki disease could possibly also explain the BCG reactivation in our patient. These mechanisms are especially intriguing as measles infections typically cause suppression of delayed type hypersensitivity and anergy to tuberculin [9] .

We report the rare finding of BCG reactivation in a child with confirmed measles infection. Although BCG reactivation is known to be an extremely important and highly specific clinical manifestation of KD, this case suggests that BCG reactivation may also occur in other childhood diseases or infections. A thorough search for an infective aetiological agent may be indicated in children presenting with this clinical finding.

ciliaFA: a research tool for automated, high-throughput measurement of ciliary beat frequency using freely available software

Background: Analysis of ciliary function for assessment of patients suspected of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and for research studies of respiratory and ependymal cilia requires assessment of both ciliary beat pattern and beat frequency. While direct measurement of beat frequency from high-speed video recordings is the most accurate and reproducible technique it is extremely time consuming. The aim of this study was to develop a freely available automated method of ciliary beat frequency analysis from digital video (AVI) files that runs on open-source software (ImageJ) coupled to Microsoft Excel, and to validate this by comparison to the direct measuring high-speed video recordings of respiratory and ependymal cilia. These models allowed comparison to cilia beating between 3 and 52 Hz.

Methods: Digital video files of motile ciliated ependymal (frequency range 34 to 52 Hz) and respiratory epithelial cells (frequency 3 to 18 Hz) were captured using a high-speed digital video recorder. To cover the range above between 18 and 37 Hz the frequency of ependymal cilia were slowed by the addition of the pneumococcal toxin pneumolysin. Measurements made directly by timing a given number of individual ciliary beat cycles were compared with those obtained using the automated ciliaFA system.

Results: The overall mean difference (± SD) between the ciliaFA and direct measurement high-speed digital imaging methods was −0.05 ± 1.25 Hz, the correlation coefficient was shown to be 0.991 and the Bland-Altman limits of agreement were from −1.99 to 1.49 Hz for respiratory and from −2.55 to 3.25 Hz for ependymal cilia.

Conclusions: A plugin for ImageJ was developed that extracts pixel intensities and performs fast Fourier transformation (FFT) using Microsoft Excel. The ciliaFA software allowed automated, high throughput measurement of respiratory and ependymal ciliary beat frequency (range 3 to 52 Hz) and avoids operator error due to selection bias. We have included free access to the ciliaFA plugin and installation instructions in Additional file 1 accompanying this manuscript that other researchers may use.

In the human respiratory tract cilia beat in a coordinated fashion at a frequency of approximately 10 to 14 Hz, propelling mucus towards the pharynx where it is swallowed [1] . This process is known as mucociliary clearance (MCC). In the brain, ependymal cilia beat at a frequency of around 40 Hz, moving cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) close to the ventricular wall. Many factors, including inherited ciliary defects in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), temperature, pH, viscosity and exposure to bacterial and viral pathogens have been shown affect ciliary function [2] [3] [4] [5] . Recent studies have shown that assessment of both ciliary beat pattern and frequency are essential as cilia may beat in a dyskinetic fashion while maintaining their normal beat frequency [5] [6] [7] . The most accurate method for determining ciliary beat frequency, particularly at high beat frequencies is by directly timing a given number of individual ciliary beat cycles from slow-motion playback of high-speed video files [7] . However, this is extremely time consuming and automated methods designed to rapidly measure beat frequency from high-speed video recordings are needed [8] [9] [10] .

Early automated methods, including the laser lightscattering spectroscopy, photodiode and photomultiplier methods were developed to calculate ciliary beat frequency (CBF) based on changes in light intensity around beating cilia under the microscope [11] [12] [13] . More recently, a number of bespoke image analysis software programs have been developed to automatically compute CBF from video files captured using video microscopy [8] [9] [10] . This software computes changes in pixel intensity over time (as shown in Figure 1A ) to Hertz using fast Fourier transformation (FFT), a function that has been used frequently for this application [14, 15] . However, the studies that describe this software lack two important elements: comparison of their results to the direct measurement of ciliary beat frequency from slow-motion video replay of cilia, and the measurement cilia that beat at very high frequencies [8, 9] . This is important as some phenotypes of PCD display respiratory cilia that beat at frequencies above 16 Hz and brain ependymal cilia beat at frequencies higher than 36 Hz. In this paper, we describe software that was validated by comparing results to those obtained by direct measurement of high-speed video recordings of cilia. The program also runs using open-source software. To evaluate a wide range of ciliary beat frequencies we studied both human respiratory cilia and ependymal cilia from the rat brain. Respiratory cilia usually beat at less than 16 Hz [7] and brain cilia usually beat at over 36 Hz. To obtain CBF measurements above 16 Hz, we slowed the frequency at which ependymal cilia beat by adding the pneumococcal toxin pneumolysin, which we have previously shown to reduce ependymal CBF [4] . The ciliaFA program has been made freely available and may be downloaded in Additional file 1.

Vibratome sections (250 μm thick) of the floor of the fourth ventricle of the brains of infant Wistar rats (between 9 and 15 days of age) were prepared to allow ependymal cilia to be viewed on an inverted microscope using a × 40 objective lens. Each section was submerged under 4 ml of media 199 (M199, Gibco, Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), as described previously [16] .

Human respiratory epithelium was obtained by brushing the inferior nasal turbinate with a 2-mm cytology brush (Keymed, Southend-on-Sea, UK) as previously described [7] . Cells were dislodged from the brush into M199 medium and grown to a ciliated phenotype at air-liquid interface as previously described [17] . Ethical approval for the collection of nasal epithelial cells was given by the Leicestershire Ethical Review Committee. 

To determine ciliary beat frequency, both the brain slices and the respiratory cells in culture were placed in an incubation (37°C) chamber and were observed via an inverted microscope system (Nikon TU1000, Kingstonupon-Thames, UK). Tissue was allowed to equilibrate for 30 minutes before readings. Beating cilia were recorded using a Motion Pro X4 digital high-speed video camera (Lake Image Systems, Henrietta, N.Y. USA) at a rate of 250 to 500 frames per second using an × 40 objective as previously described [18] . At least 512 or 1,024 frames were captured, respectively.

The camera allows video sequences to be recorded and played back at reduced frame rates or frame by frame. CBF is calculated by the observer timing a given number of individual cilia beat cycles using the following equation: Frame rate (number of frames/sec)/5 (frames elapsed for five ciliary beat cycles) × 5 (conversion per beat cycle).

To evaluate beat frequencies between the upper limit of normal (approximately 16 Hz) for respiratory cilia and the lower limit of normal for ependymal cilia (approximately 36 Hz) we slowed ependymal ciliary beat frequency by the addition of the pneumococcal toxin, pneumolysin. We have previously shown pneumolysin to reduce ependymal ciliary beat frequency [4] . Pneumolysin was purified as previously described [19] . Cells were exposed to 1 ml M199 containing 300 ng of pneumolysin, which was preheated to 37°C. The CBF was measured at intervals of 0, 5, and 15 minutes over the course of the experiment. At each time point, images were captured from four different areas along the ciliated edge of the brain slice.

To develop software to batch-process and calculate CBF, we focused on two core components: the first was to extract the pixel intensities of particular region of interest (ROI) over time and the second to use this data for fast Fourier transformation (FFT). We used the freely available open-source ImageJ software to determine the average pixel intensity of up to 40 × 40 ROI per frame of the AVI file [20] . The ciliaFA plugin exports a dataset of up to 1,600 ROI to Excel 2007 (Microsoft; Redmond, WA, USA) where a visual basic macro is initiated to perform the FFT. The complex number is translated using the Excel function '=IMABS(range)' and the dominant frequency within the range is then established using the function '=MAX(range)'. The CBF is determined by multiplying the row number by the frequency resolution (FR) (frame rate of recording/number of frames), which we named the 'FFT Mag'. In order to more accurately predict the CBF, we averaged the sum of the FFT Mag of the peaks flanking the maximum (see Figure 1B) .

We found that excluding data based on the following criteria significantly reduced the effect of background interference that can result from Fourier analysis: (1) the amplitude of the peak must be greater than three times the amplitude of the background (defined as the maximum peak of the first three FFT Mag), (2) the CBF must be within a clinically relevant range (for example between 3 to 20 Hz for respiratory cilia and 3 to 60 Hz for brain ependymal cilia). Data that does not support these criteria was defined as 0 Hz.

The resulting Excel data sheet presents the CBF calculations as a report that allows the observer to obtain information about individual regions of interest or the image as a whole. Raw data (including pixel intensities and the power spectrum of the FFT ( Figure 1B) ) from individual regions of interest can be inspected using a drop-down menu. The results report displays the mean, median and modal CBFs of the field, and a histogram of the CBF of all regions of interest (Figure 2A) . A color chart of the intensity of the CBF for each regions of interest is also presented in Figure 2B .

Linear regression was used to correlate CBF measurements made by conventional frame by frame counting of individual ciliary beat cycles by slow-motion playback of digital high-speed video sequences to measurements obtained using the ciliaFA system (for the same region of interest). All regions of interest were chosen based on areas where optimal images of moving cilia were visible to the observer. The video sequences were reanalyzed by a second observer. Paired t tests were performed to compare the CBF obtained using the two methods and the Bland-Altman limits of agreement were calculated from the mean difference ± the 95% confidence intervals between the two methods.

A total of 200 measurements were made for ciliary beat frequency, 100 for ependymal cilia and 100 for respiratory cilia. There was no significant difference (paired t test, P = 0.64) in the ciliary beat frequency obtained using the direct counting and ciliaFA methods (n = 200). The mean difference (± SD) was −0.05 ± 1.25 Hz and was highly correlated (r 2 = 0.991) (Figure 3 ).

For ependymal cilia the mean CBF was 36.3 ± 6.4 Hz for the direct counting and 35.9 ± 7.0 Hz for the ciliaFA method. For respiratory cilia the mean CBF was 11.72 ± 2.8 Hz for the direct counting and 11.97 ± 3.0 Hz for the ciliaFA method. The Bland-Altman limits showed agreement from −2.55 to 3.25 Hz for the ependymal cilia and showed a closer agreement for the respiratory cilia (−1.99 to 1.49 Hz).

The addition of the bacterial toxin pneumolysin reduced the mean CBF of ependymal cilia within 5 minutes ( Table 1 ). The mean CBF values after 5 minutes exposure to pneumolysin determined by the ciliaFA was 21.45 ± 4.1 Hz. Using the direct counting method, two different observers calculated a mean CBF of 21.75 ± 4.5 Hz and 21.79 ± 4.2 Hz respectively. Repeatability (agreement between methods) was very good and presented values similar to the agreement between two different observers (1.13 Hz and 1.08 Hz respectively). At 15 minutes after the addition of pneumolysin the cilia were mostly static ( Figure 2 ). The ciliaFA accurately predicted the reduction in CBF and detected regions of interest where the cilia had become static.

We have developed a plugin for ImageJ that calculates CBF from digital AVI files recorded using high-speed Table 1 The ependymal ciliary beat frequency (CBF) determined by two observers using high-speed digital imaging and the ciliaFA software video microscopy. As opposed to previous studies we validated the software by comparing the results to frequencies obtained using the most accurate method for CBF calculation, directly counting individual ciliary beat cycles during slow-motion playback. Our data showed that the software was validated for use over a wide range of ciliary beat frequencies up to 52 Hz. Table 1 shows that the limits of agreement between the two methods were within the same range as the natural variation that exists between two different observers. Furthermore, the Bland-Altman limits of agreement for human respiratory cilia between the ciliaFA and direct counting methods were very low. Previous software programs validated their results using indirect, less accurate methods, including the early automated photometry method [9] . Previous studies reported limits of agreement ranging from −1.0 to 1.39 Hz [9] , -2.75 to 5.15 Hz [7] and from −3.89 to 3.39 Hz [8] compared to digital high-speed methods. In our system the image capture instrument is not connected to the software, so analysis performed once the experiment is completed. This allows the software to batch process groups of images using the same settings and thus reducing operator input. This study has clearly demonstrated that ciliaFA is reliable system to analyze CBF. In addition to the accurate measurement of ciliary beat frequency the ciliaFA system has a number of advantages. It has high throughput capabilities allowing significant time savings when processing large datasets, it reduces operator error due to selection bias, and it accurately reports static cilia. The latter is a significant advantage as immotile cilia may not be visible to the observer in multilayered cell cultures. Furthermore, by focusing on particular ciliated areas, ciliaFA can report changes and reductions in ciliary beat frequency.

Limitations of the software depend largely on image quality (pixel size) and the number of frames captured. We have used the ciliaFA software to examine AVI files of different lengths, captured at different frame rates (data not shown). We found that videos captured using high-speed video cameras that capture at rates at least 120 frames per second with a length of 128 frames (to give a frequency resolution of 0.94) will give valid data. These settings capture an appropriate number of ciliary beat cycles to accurately average the CBF; the lower the frequency resolution (that is, the more frames captured), the greater the accuracy of CBF. To allow the videos to be used for beat pattern analysis high-speed video cameras that capture at rates exceeding 250 frames per second should be used. The ciliaFA software has the capability to crop frames from large files to speed up the calculation of frequency without reducing the frequency resolution. For high-frequency analysis, we recommend that the microscope bulb is connected to a stable power source of at least 110 volt AC/60 Hz; lower voltages may cause the bulb to flicker within the CBF range and this will enhance background noise. We also recommend that the image is not subject to downstream processing, such as enhanced pixel gain, as this will also enhance background noise.

The open-source software (ImageJ) and Microsoft Excel platforms were chosen due to their ubiquity, low cost and ease of manipulation. We have included the ciliaFA plugin and installation instructions in Additional file 1 accompanying this manuscript, so it is free to use by other research groups.

We have developed a freely available, automated method of CBF analysis from digital video (AVI) files that runs using open-source software (ImageJ) coupled to Microsoft Excel. The ciliaFA software allowed automated, high throughput measurement of respiratory and ependymal ciliary beat frequency over a wide range of frequencies (range 3 to 52 Hz) and avoids operator error due to selection bias.

SNAD: sequence name annotation-based designer

Background: A growing diversity of biological data is tagged with unique identifiers (UIDs) associated with polynucleotides and proteins to ensure efficient computer-mediated data storage, maintenance, and processing. These identifiers, which are not informative for most people, are often substituted by biologically meaningful names in various presentations to facilitate utilization and dissemination of sequence-based knowledge. This substitution is commonly done manually that may be a tedious exercise prone to mistakes and omissions.

Here we introduce SNAD (Sequence Name Annotation-based Designer) that mediates automatic conversion of sequence UIDs (associated with multiple alignment or phylogenetic tree, or supplied as plain text list) into biologically meaningful names and acronyms. This conversion is directed by precompiled or user-defined templates that exploit wealth of annotation available in cognate entries of external databases. Using examples, we demonstrate how this tool can be used to generate names for practical purposes, particularly in virology.

A tool for controllable annotation-based conversion of sequence UIDs into biologically meaningful names and acronyms has been developed and placed into service, fostering links between quality of sequence annotation, and efficiency of communication and knowledge dissemination among researchers.

Identifiers (ID) composed of alphanumeric and other symbols are commonly used for tagging protein and nucleotide sequences and associated annotation in Gen-Bank [1], UniProt [2] , and other sources that either use these sequences or deal with molecular properties of associated biological entities (Table 1) . For instance in Uni-Prot, the primary accession number is the sole UID. In GenBank three fields, locus, accession and version, carry four different IDs, but only gi number (known also as primary ID) and accession number combined with version form unique IDs (UIDs). Each UID is assigned to a single entry. In contrast, a particular non-unique ID may be found in numerous entries. The UIDs ensure efficient computer-mediated data storage, maintenance and processing. To facilitate data mapping and transfer between different databases, in which ID inter-conversion plays important part, several specialized resources including GoMiner [3] , ErmineJ [4] , SOURCE [5] , RESOURCERER [6] ; IDconverter and IDClight [7] , and DAVID [8] have been developed.

Sequence IDs are used for tagging sequences also in multiple sequence alignments and sequence-based phylogenetic trees in various presentations including publications [9] [10] [11] [12] ). Notwithstanding UniProt/SwissProt [2] entry names (Table 1) , these machine-readable IDs are not very informative in human communications. Consequently, sequence IDs are commonly replaced by biologically meaningful names and acronyms, e.g. species names in trees and gene/protein names in alignments. When a large-scale dataset is to be processed, manual replacement of IDs with names could be a tedious task prone to mistakes and omissions.

By some considerations, the ID-to-name conversion for viral sequences is both of particular relevance and of considerable complexity. First, a large body of results in virus research can be linked to underlying sequences, owing to relatively small number of known viruses and comparatively small sizes of their extensively characterized genomes. Second, the virus naming, at the species level and below, is not governed by either the binomial Latin name convention traditional for cellular organisms or another broadly accepted nomenclature [13] that complicates communication in virology. For species, naming viruses is under auspices of the International Committee of Virus Taxonomy (ICTV) [14] . At the isolate and strain level, it is left up to individuals or groups of researchers to decide how to proceed [15, 16] . Researchers studying few economically most important viruses developed nomenclatures restricted for these viruses [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . In contrast, each decision about naming that concerns a majority of viruses is an ad hoc and, often, lengthy process. Likewise, naming viruses with artificially designed genomes, which are not product of natural evolution [23] , is formally outside of the ICTV authority and completely unregulated.

The problem of ID-to-name conversion has been partially addressed in the NEXUS alignment format [24] , which has a reserved part (block) for converting names in a predefined manner, and in the stand-alone tool Phyutility [25] that allows combining a limited number of GenBank characteristics with a custom separator to form sequence names. Here we introduce a dedicated web tool dubbed Sequence Name Annotation-based Designer (SNAD) that provides a versatile facility with user-friendly interface for automatic conversion of sequence UIDs into biologically informative names and acronyms in controllable manner using annotation associated with sequences. Several examples are provided to illustrate how SNAD can be used to generate names for practical purposes, particularly in virology. Implementation SNAD (ver. 1.6) is accessible at http://veb.lumc.nl/SNAD. SNAD code is written in Perl (BioPerl for dynamic retrieval of entries from databases, CGI for interfacing Perl code with web server, original Perl code for analysis of sequence objects retrieved from databases, and conversion of sequence annotation into complex names, part of application programming interface -API), JavaScript (graphical user interface for uploading data, designing format of name conversion and representing results), Java (part of API) and HTML for SNAD web site pages (see http://veb.lumc.nl/SNAD where a detailed description of all SNAD options and parameters can be found). SNAD can be used as a web server with APIs in Perl and Java available on SNAD web site. SNAD recognizes input as alignment or tree with the use of BioPerl drivers (Bio::TreeIO and Bio::AlignIO). If the input is not recognized as alignment or tree, SNAD processes it as a list of identifiers separated by one or more of the following symbols: space, new line, tabulator, or comma. To map IDs on database entries, Bio::DB::(GenBank, SwissProt, EMBL or SeqHound) drivers and Bio::EnsEMBL::DBSQL::DBAdaptor are used. SNAD uses standard BioPerl functions from Bio::Seq for extracting features/annotation from the database entries (GenBank/RefSeq/GenPept, UniProt, EMBL, SeqHound) or functions from database programming interface (EnsEMBL). Detailed description of all available functions is presented in "Introduction" page of the web site. SNAD code is available for downloading by noncommercial users per request sent to SNAD@lumc.nl.

The diagram of SNAD dataflow is shown in Figure 1 . The user submits sequence IDs, defines a format of conversion, and selects a database to be searched. Currently available databases include GenBank/RefSeq/GenPept, UniProt, EMBL, SeqHound and EnsEMBL (Gene and Transcripts divisions for Human sequences). SNAD extracts IDs from the input and queries the database with these IDs to locate associated annotation. After retrieving annotation, SNAD designs names according to a name template that defines name structure and annotationbased content for submitted entries. The final step of the SNAD-mediated processing is substitution of submitted IDs in the input with the designed names to return results to the user.

The SNAD web site has six pages including a detailed guide to SNAD with examples ("Introduction"), program execution page ("Execution"), guided access to Java and Perl APIs ("APIs"), frequently asked questions page ("FAQs"), list of the SNAD versions ("History"), and "Reference" page. SNAD execution page has three vertically arranged sections: "Before unique ID (UID) conversion" for uploading input, "Names/format designer" for choosing and refining pre-compiled name templates, and "After UID conversion" for accessing output (Figure 2 ).

The input can be either copy-pasted or uploaded from a file. SNAD accepts IDs from five databases (Table 1) including GenBank (gi or accession number) and UniProt (accession number or entry name) that are automatically recognized in and extracted from the input data prepared in several formats: as part of tree ('newick' and 'nexus') and alignment ('fasta', 'msf', 'clustalw', 'nexus', 'phylip', 'mega' and 'stockholm') or supplied as a plain list ( Figure  2 ). Examples of IDs, unique and non-unique, in alignment, tree, and plain list are available for testing purposes. SNAD may accept input with non-unique IDs, e.g. Gen-Bank accession number or locus name, that are most popular among researchers. Since these IDs may be associated with multiple entries, SNAD must decide which entry is to be used to retrieve annotation. The adopted approach is to use the most recent entry that might be not the one the user aimed at to retrieve annotation. The user may request automatically generated ID-to-name log (see below) for checking the quality of the conversion. To ensure unequivocal ID processing the user must use UIDs in input. UIDs from one database can be used to query another non-cognate database in which it may be not recognized at all or recognized as non-unique IDs ( The user has a choice of reading SNAD output either on the "Execution" web page, or at a separate web page in plain text mode, or receiving it via e-mail. For tree input, SNAD generates, additionally to the standard output, a respective tree drawn to facilitate visual inspection of the generated names in graphic format. The web page output can be enhanced with links to cognate entries accessible through the generated names.

There are two ways of defining format of the UID conversion: using either precompiled or user-defined name templates. The user is currently provided with several precompiled templates for name generation, which can be used "as is" or after refinement (see below). Each template is accompanied with examples of input to illustrate its usage. "Entry name" template can be useful for identifying misspelled identifiers, as well as for comparative inspection of basic information about the entries in UniProt. Two other templates ("Gene" and "Species") can be used for converting UIDs into gene and species names, respectively, as they are specified in GenBank. The "Complex species name" template combines full species name with primary ID (gi) that are neatly separated. The "Complex protein name" includes primary ID, condensed species name, protein description and CDS, and locus tag, in a size restricted manner to facilitate reading a complex name structure. These templates are suited for producing names of sequences originated from a wide range of organisms. "Acronym" template converts GenBank organism name annotation into acronym. Three templates were designed specifically for viruses to address specifics of this group for which the naming remains a matter of debate [15, 17] . For several medically important viruses with large sampling from the natural diversity, e.g. influenza and noroviruses [18, 22] , names conventions were accepted by the field to include reference to serotype, host species, country of isolation, strain or isolate name, collection date and, for influenza viruses, subtype. These names are part of the GenBank entries where from they can be readily extracted. To demonstrate that similar names can be also generated on-the-fly from two components, using the isolate/strain and serotype fields in respective entries, a separate "Influenza virus name" template is provided. We extended this approach by designing two other virus templates, "Complex virus name I" and "Complex virus name II", that could generate names with complex structure for majority of other viruses for which no consensus on the naming has been reached. These templates combine information from up to six separate entry fields, each keeping an elementary record e.g. about date or place of virus isolation. "Complex virus name II" additionally includes reference to protein function. These templates could help researchers studying many viruses, e.g. coronaviruses and picornaviruses [15] communicate their sequence-based data in a name format similar to that accepted for influenza virus. SNAD-mediated solution to the generation of complex virus names reinforces the role of diverse fields in sequence entries as the primary source of information. If these fields are completed with records as expected, virus names can be readily generated under different and evolving conventions. Thus, SNAD provides a tool for explora-SNAD dataflow Figure 1 SNAD dataflow. User submits sequence UIDs and defines a format of conversion by choosing a template. SNAD analyzes the input, extracts UIDs from it and queries a user-defined database to locate cognate entries. The next step is extracting annotation from the entries and parsing the user-selected template to generate separate parts. They are mapped onto annotation to produce name parts, which are combined into names according to the template. Finally, SNAD substitutes the submitted UIDs in list, alignment, or tree with the designed names and returns results to the user. Unique IDs conversion with SNAD. Nine IDs from GenBank (section "Before UID conversion") are converted using a pre-compiled four-characteristic template "Complex protein name" that includes the following GenBank characteristics: "Primary ID" (gi number); organism name formatted as "G [enus].species"; protein product and gene locus tag. Three delimiters are used: space, " [" and "]", and none of characteristics is abbreviated. First three characteristics have their size limited to: 9, 6, and 17 symbols, respectively. Results of the conversion are shown in "After UID conversion" section. Each arrow links a delimiter to a part of converted names. {...} indicates that more than one organism name characteristic is found for a submitted ID (see [GenBank/Protein: 126224], features source/organism). SNAD users can initiate refining of any of the provided templates (by using "Refine name template" option) or generate de novo templates by choosing "User defined" template that automatically activates the refining mode. In both instances, the advanced template-building facility becomes available for the user. It empowers the user with fine control over the output name format, including the number of independently designed parts of the name, characteristic of each part, parts order, size of each part, and type of delimiter preceding each part ( Figure 2 ). Design of each part in the name is controlled by a separate row. The name parts -from left to right -are defined by respective rows in the template-building facility from top to bottom. Rows can be moved up and down or deleted and inserted with a respective effect on the name structure and content. For retrieving sequence characteristics from database entries SNAD uses BioPerl scheme with internally controlled vocabulary of annotation [26] . Information from two or more annotation fields can also be combined in a single characteristic in a template. For instance, for virus name templates, a combination "strain OR isolate" may be used to form a characteristic. For name designing, the user can choose from a dropdown menu of sequence characteristics and features that were derived from available databases. These characteristics can be used separately or in combination to design a name format that can combine, for instance, unique reference to the original database with a concise biological description of the entry (see Figure 2 for an example). For characteristics which values are described with several words, first letters of these words can be combined using characteristic's "abbreviate" option to produce acronyms. If a selected characteristic is not available in annotation for a sequence, it is replaced in the sequence name with a symbol that the user selected from a separate drop-down menu. Due to gaps in annotation, names designed with the templates may not be complete for every entry.

SNAD has a menu that controls output display interactively. By default, output includes ID-to-name log in which selected information about generated names is detailed in table format that can be downloaded as an Excel file. This table can be useful for controlling the name generation procedure and preparing legends to accompany an alignment or a phylogenetic tree in publication. The user can also extract IDs from submitted alignment or tree by activating "names only" option, or retrieve annotation from cognate entries in table format. In the current implementation of SNAD, the most time-consuming stage is data retrieval from databases. For large queries and complex name formats, also using API, it is therefore advisable to start with less than 10 sequences to design a format to be used for the full query. Queries containing up to 500 IDs and including sequence alignments up to 50000 characters can be processed through SNAD web page. For queries containing more than 500 IDs, the user is advised to use one of the SNAD APIs.

The availability of description for characteristics in a particular set of entries from databases is a major factor determining how well names designed with SNAD match expectation. The amount and accuracy of annotation in sequence databases vary markedly between entries that has been a major concern for the bioinformatics community continuously working toward improving this critical aspect of sequence databases [7, 8, 27] . Involving other researchers in this effort, especially those who submit original sequence annotation in the first place, could accelerate the process. We hope that through using SNAD service, researchers could see immediate benefits from better annotation for their research that may create impetus for contributing quality annotation to public databases. To improve the user experience with SNAD, we plan to expand the diversity of databases and templates upon future upgrades of SNAD. Any template that the users designed and considered useful could be included in the future SNAD releases.

A tool for controllable annotation-based conversion of sequence UIDs into biologically meaningful names and acronyms has been developed and placed into service, fostering links between quality of sequence annotation, and efficiency of communication and knowledge dissemination among researchers. 

Differential regulation of self-reactive cD4 + T cells in cervical lymph nodes and central nervous system during Viral encephalomyelitis

Viral infections have long been implicated as triggers of autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), a central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory demyelinating disorder. Epitope spreading, molecular mimicry, cryptic antigen, and bystander activation have been implicated as mechanisms responsible for activating self-reactive (SR) immune cells, ultimately leading to organ-specific autoimmune disease. Taking advantage of coronavirus JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV)-induced demyelination, this study demonstrates that the host also mounts counteractive measures to specifically limit expansion of endogenous SR T cells. In this model, immune-mediated demyelination is associated with induction of SR T cells after viral control. However, their decline during persisting infection, despite ongoing demyelination, suggests an active control mechanism. Antigen-specific IL-10-secreting CD4 + T cells (Tr1) and Foxp3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs), both known to control autoimmunity and induced following JHMV infection, were assessed for their relative in vivo suppressive function of SR T cells. Ablation of Foxp3 + Tregs in chronically infected DEREG mice significantly increased SR CD4 + T cells within cervical lymph nodes (CLN), albeit without affecting their numbers or activation within the CNS compared to controls. In contrast, infected IL-27 receptor deficient (IL-27R −/− ) mice, characterized by a drastic reduction of Tr1 cells, revealed that SR CD4 + T cells in CLN remained unchanged but were specifically increased within the CNS. These results suggest that distinct Treg subsets limit SR T cells in the draining lymph nodes and CNS to maximize suppression of SR T-cell-mediated autoimmune pathology. The JHMV model is thus valuable to decipher tissue-specific mechanisms preventing autoimmunity.

inTrODUcTiOn Viruses have long been associated with autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), such as multiple sclerosis (MS), both as potential inducers and as facilitators of a selfreactive (SR) immune response (1, 2) . While the detection of viral antigens and antiviral antibodies in MS brains supports a role for viral infections in triggering autoimmunity (3) (4) (5) , the "hygiene hypothesis" rather proposes a protective function (6, 7) , underlining the ambiguous link between viral infections and MS (8) . This dichotomy between viral infections and autoimmune diseases is reflected in two prominent models of viral-induced demyelination, i.e., Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) and neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). During persistent TMEV infection, activation of SR T cells by epitope spreading triggers an autoimmune disease characterized by demyelination and ascending paralysis (9, 10) . By contrast, despite ongoing demyelination, persistent neurotropic MHV infections are defined by clinical recovery with no evidence for autoimmune-mediated clinical symptoms (11, 12) . Nevertheless, our recent study demonstrated that endogenous SR T cells are activated specifically during chronic infection, correlating with kinetics of JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV)-induced demyelination (13) . However, the endogenous SR T cell response declined despite sustained myelin loss during viral persistence and the preserved ability of antigen-presenting cells from both cervical lymph nodes (CLN) and the CNS to activate myelin-specific CD4 + T cells ex vivo. These findings suggested that chronic JHMV infection actively induces suppressive mechanisms to limit the development of autoimmunity. Immune regulation associated with viral infections requires a delicate balance between promoting effective virus clearance while limiting tissue damage. This is especially critical within the CNS due to its limited regenerative capacity. Following JHMV infection, T cells primarily control infectious virus within the brain and spinal cords within 2 weeks. Nevertheless, viral persistence is evident by ongoing detection of viral RNA predominantly within spinal cords. Demyelination is initiated during T cell-mediated control of viral replication, peaks subsequent to virus control, but continues throughout persistence (12) . Induction of Foxp3 + regulatory T cell (Tregs) and type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells and their migration to the CNS are already evident during the acute infection (14, 15) . Both regulatory populations are known to control autoimmune diseases (16, 17) . Prior studies of their role during JHMV infection demonstrated that Tr1 cells have a limited effect on tissue damage (15) , while Foxp3 + Tregs restrict the extent of demyelination without affecting viral persistence (18, 19) . Indeed, depletion of CD25 + regulatory CD4 + T cells prior JHMV infection correlated with increased myelin loss during viral persistence (19) . Similarly, transfer of naive Foxp3 + Tregs into acutely JHMV-infected mice improved clinical disease and restricted tissue damage without altering control of virus replication (20) . The limited role of Foxp3 + Tregs in virus clearance was also confirmed by unaltered antiviral T cell responses following Foxp3 + Treg depletion during acute infection with the less pathogenic MHV-A59 strain (21) . However, the same study showed that Foxp3 + Tregs limited proliferation of transferred SR T cells in the CLN (21) . Altogether, these data support the notion that Foxp3 + Tregs limit tissue damage by specifically counteracting the activation of endogenous SR T cells, without apparent affects on antiviral T cells. However, in all these studies, transfer or depletion of Foxp3 + Tregs were performed during acute MHV infection, prior to the induction of endogenous SR T cells (13) , limiting knowledge of their function during persistence. Regulation of in vivo primed SR T cells and immunopathology by endogenous Foxp3 + Treg during persistence remains unexplored.

To assess how Foxp3 + Treg depletion affects endogenous SR T cells during JHMV persistence, we chose DEREG mice, which express the human diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor under the control of the Foxp3 promoter (22) . Incomplete DT-mediated Foxp3 + Treg depletion in naive adult DEREG mice is advantageous to our studies as it enables a window to study effects of Foxp3 + Treg ablation on myelin reactive CD4 + T cells without confounding complications of lymphoproliferative disease and systemic lethal autoimmunity (23, 24) . DT treatment of JHMV-infected DEREG mice at the peak of SR T cell CNS infiltration (between days 21 and 28 post infection), resulted in increased lymphocyte expansion and T cell activation in CLN, coincident with elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine expression compared to DT-treated controls. More importantly, Foxp3 + Treg ablation specifically increased frequencies of myelin-specific but not virus-specific CD4 + T cells, indicating preferential regulation of peripheral SR T cells by Foxp3 + Tregs. Surprisingly however, CNS inflammation, viral persistence, and demyelination remained similar consistent with no changes in virus and myelin-specific CD4 + T cells within the CNS. The apparent redundant role of Foxp3 + Tregs in regulating CNS inflammation implied a potential protective function of Tr1 cells. Analysis of SR T cells during chronic JHMV infection of IL-27R −/− mice, which lack Tr1 cells, revealed no effects within the CLN. By contrast, both virus-specific and SR CD4 + T cells were increased within the CNS of IL-27R −/− relative to wild-type (WT) mice. Altogether, these data indicate differential regulation of SR CD4 + T cells within the CLN versus CNS during chronic JHMV infection. While Foxp3 + Tregs specifically control myelinspecific CD4 + T cells within CLN, Tr1 cells limit SR T cells within the CNS.

Mice, infection, and Foxp3 + Treg Depletion C57BL/6 WT mice were purchased from the National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD, USA). C57BL/6 DEREG mice, which express the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) and diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) under the control of the Foxp3 promoter, were kindly provided by Dr. T. Sparwasser (Twincore, Hannover, Germany) (22) . C57BL/6 homozygous IL-27Rα (WSX-1) deficient (IL-27R −/− ) mice were provided by Dr. C. Saris (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA). Mice were bred and maintained at the Biological Resources Unit of the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute under sterile conditions. All procedures were performed in compliance with protocols approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice of both sexes at 6-7 weeks of age were infected in the left hemisphere with 1,000 plaque forming unit (PFU) of the sublethal gliatropic JHMV monoclonal antibody (mAb) derived variant designated 2.2v-1 (25) in 30-μl endotoxin-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Mice were assessed daily for clinical disease severity according to the following scale: 0, healthy; 1, hunched back and ruffled fur; 2, partial hind limb paralysis or inability to maintain the upright position; 3, complete hind limb paralysis; 4, moribund or dead. For Foxp3 + Treg depletion, DEREG mice and control littermates (Foxp3 eGFP DTR − mice) received daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 1-μg DT (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) between days 21 and 28 post infection (p.i.).

Mice were perfused with ice cold PBS before harvesting CLN, spleen (SPL), brain, and spinal cord. CLN were dissociated through a cell strainer and single cell suspensions washed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium. For splenocyte isolation, tissues were dissociated, treated with Gey's solution to lyse red blood cells, and washed twice in RPMI 1640 medium. To isolate CNS infiltrating cells, brains and spinal cords were homogenized in 4-ml Dulbecco's PBS using TenBroeck tissue grinders as described (26) . Tissue homogenates were adjusted to 30% Percoll (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) and underlayed with 1-ml 70% Percoll. Following centrifugation at 850 g for 30 min at 4°C, mononuclear cells were recovered from the 30-70% interface and washed with RPMI 1640 medium.

Cells were resuspended in FACS buffer (Dulbecco's PBS + 1% bovine serum albumin). Non-specific staining was blocked with mouse serum and anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (clone 2.4G2, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) for 15 min on ice. Cells were stained for 30 min on ice with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), phycoerythrin (PE), peridin chlorophyll protein (PerCP), or allophycocyamin (APC) conjugated mAb (all for BD Biosciences expect when indicated) specific for CD45 (clone Ly-5), CD4 (clone GK1.5), CD8 (clone 53-6.7), CD11b (M1/70), CD25 (clone PC61), MHC class II (clone 2G9), CD44 (clone IM7), CD62L (clone MEL-14), CD69 (clone H1-2F3), and CXCR3 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Virus-specific CD8 T cells were characterized using H-2D b /S510 MHC class I tetramers (27) . Intracellular staining for Foxp3 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR, USA). rna extraction, reverse Transcription, and gene expression analysis Snap-frozen tissues were homogenized in TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using a TissueLyser and stainless steel beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). RNA was extracted according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, RNA was extracted by adding chloroform prior to centrifugation at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4°C. RNA was then precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, washed with 75% ethanol, and resuspended in RNase-free water. DNA contamination was eliminated by DNase I treatment for 30 min at 37°C (DNA-free kit, Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a mixture of oligo(dT) (10 mM) (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and 250 ng random primers (Promega). Gene expression analysis was performed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) using SYBR Green or Taqman master mixes on a 7500 Fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). SYBR Green primers used for transcripts were as follows: GADPH, 5′-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGATGCAGGGATGATGTTC-3′ (antisense); JHMV nucleocapsid, 5′-CGCAGAGTATGGCGACGAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAGGTCCTAGTCTCGGCCTGTT-3′ (antisense); IL-2, 5′-CAGGATGGAGAATTACAGGAACCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTT CAATTCTGTGGCCTGCTT-3′ (antisense); CCL5, 5′-GCAA GTGCTCCAATCTTGCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTTCTCTGGGTT GGCACACA-3′ (antisense); CXCL9, 5′-TGCACGATGCTCCT GCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGGTCTTTGAGGGATTTGTAGTGG-3′ (antisense); and CXCL10, 5′-GACGGTCCGCTGCAACTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCTTCCCTATGGCCCTCATT-3′ (antisense). GAPDH, interferon gamma (IFN-γ), and CCL2 mRNA levels were determined using TaqMan primers. Transcript levels were normalized to the levels of the housekeeping gene GAPDH by using the formula 2[Ct (GAPDH) − Ct (gene) ] × 1,000, where Ct represents the threshold cycle value.

Virus (M133)-, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)and myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific CD4 T cells were detected by Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSPOT (ELISPOT) assay as described (13) . Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with IFN-γ capture Ab (BD Biosciences). Serial dilutions of cells were cultured for 36 h at 37°C in RPMI complete (RPMI 1640 medium containing 2-mM l-glutamine, non-essential amino acid, 1-mM sodium pyruvate, 25-μg/ml gentamycine, and 5 × 10 −5 M 2-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in the presence of stimulator splenocytes preincubated with or without 1-μM peptide (M 133−147 , GTVYVRPIIEDYHT; MOG 35−55 , MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK; MBP 60−80 , SHHAARTTHYGSLPQKSQR; Bio-Synthesis, Lewisville, TX, USA). Spots were detected by sequential incubation with biotinylated anti-IFN-γ mAb (BD Biosciences) overnight at 4°C, horseradish peroxidase conjugated streptavidin (BD Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Numbers of spots were determined using a CTL ImmunoSpot analyzer (Cellular Technology Ltd., Shaker Heights, OH, USA). Spots detected in wells with no peptide (negative control) were subtracted from spots formed in the presence of peptide and results presented as the number of IFN-γ secreting cells normalized to 10 6 input cells.

After PBS perfusion, spinal cords were fixed in 10% zinc formalin, divided into six sections (two per cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions) prior embedding in paraffin. Then, 6 μm cross sections were stained with Luxol fast blue (LFB) to visualize demyelinated lesions. To determine the percentage of demyelination, LFB-stained sections of all six levels per individual mouse were scanned with an Aperio ScanScope (Vista, CA, USA) at 40× and areas of demyelination within the white matter tracks were quantify using Aperio software.

Data represent the mean ± SEM and were plotted using Graphpad prism 5.0 software (Graphpad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Statistical analysis was performed using a Mann-Whitney test, Dunn's multiple comparison test, and ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test. p-Values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Foxp3 + Tregs infiltrate the CNS during acute JHMV infection and are retained together with both virus-specific and SR T cells during persistence (13, 19) . However, their role in regulating endogenously primed T cell populations of viral, and more importantly, SR specificity has not been addressed. To specifically investigate a function of Foxp3 + Tregs during JHMV persistence, we infected DEREG mice, in which DT treatment abrogated the vast majority of Foxp3 + Tregs under homeostatic conditions but retained a minor fraction thereby circumventing lymphoproliferative disease (22) . We first confirmed that transgene expression in DEREG mice does not alter JHMV pathogenesis compared to syngeneic WT mice. Clinical disease onset and progression, viral clearance, and CNS inflammatory responses were similar between the two groups (data not shown). The extent and severity of demyelination within spinal cords was also not altered (data not shown). Moreover, high fluorescent intensity of eGFP expressed under control of the Foxp3 promoter in DEREG mice enabled a distinct separation of the Foxp3 + population among CD4 + T cells compared to direct intracellular Foxp3-staining in WT mice ( Figure 1A) . Most importantly, no significant differences in the frequency of Foxp3 + cells within CD4 + T cells during JHMV infection were found comparing the two groups (data not shown). Validation of Foxp3 expression in DEREG mice thus facilitated characterization of Foxp3 + Treg kinetics during the course of infection. The frequency of Foxp3 + cells within CD4 + cells remained stable at ~15% within CLN at all time points (data not shown). By contrast, within both brain and spinal cord, Foxp3 + cells within CD4 + T cells peaked at day 7 p.i. and then rapidly decreased at day 10 p.i. (Figure 1B) . However, while the frequency of Foxp3 + Tregs was maintained at ~10% within the brain after day 10 p.i. (Figure 1B) , a sustained rebound was observed in spinal cords after day 14 p.i. during chronic infection ( Figure 1B) . The sustained increase in the fraction of Foxp3 + Tregs at later time points, specifically within the spinal cord, was not attributed to viral replication, as infectious virus is cleared by day 14 p.i., and viral RNA levels continuously decline after day 10 p.i. (15) . Onset of robust demyelination in spinal cords at day 14 p.i. (12) rather implicates that the second wave of Tregs is pathology-driven and functions to limit emerging SR CD4 + T cell responses.

Based on the delayed expansion of endogenous SR CD4 + T cells coincident with onset of demyelination and rebound of Tregs in spinal cords during chronic infection (13) , we assessed the effect of Treg depletion during viral persistence. JHMV-infected DEREG mice (DTR + ) and their control littermates (DTR − ) were treated daily with DT at the peak of SR CD4 + T cell response between days 21 and 28 p.i. (13) . Foxp3 + Treg frequencies were 70% reduced at day 28 p.i. in both CLN and CNS of DTR + mice (Figures 1C,D) . By contrast, control DTR − treated mice revealed no alteration of Foxp3 + T cell frequencies in CLN and CNS after DT treatment (Figures 1C,D) . These results confirmed the specificity of DT-mediated Foxp3 + Treg depletion as well as their residual presence due to incomplete abrogation and rebound after ongoing DT treatment (23, 28) .

Initial T cell activation of both virus-and myelin-specific CD4 + T cells occurs within CLN (13, 29) , consistent with anatomical linkage between deep CLN and CNS by the meningeal lymphatic system (30) . Transfer of Foxp3 + Tregs during acute JHMV infection limited CNS tissue damage by inhibiting T cell proliferation within CLN and reducing overall T cell numbers within the CNS, yet without affecting frequencies of virus-specific T cells (20) . These studies predicted that Foxp3 + Treg depletion during chronic JHMV infection would increase T cell numbers in CLN and CNS. DT-treated DTR + mice indeed exhibited a threefold increase in CLN cellularity compared to DTR − controls between days 21 and 28 p.i. (Figure 2A) . However, overall CD4 + and CD8 + T cell proportions were not altered suggesting the cellular increase was not lymphocyte specific ( Figure 2B) . Analysis of T cell activation following Treg depletion revealed a significant increase in CD62L low CD44 hi populations in both the CD4 + and CD8 + T cell subset ( Figure 2C ). Contrasting increased activation in CLN, DTR − and DTR + mice showed no difference in total numbers of splenocytes 1 week after DT treatment (data not shown), suggesting specific regulation in CLN.

Enhanced activation specifically in CLN of DT-treated DEREG mice during persistence may be polyclonal and/or driven by low levels of residual viral or auto-antigen presentation in CLN (12, 13) . The increased T cell effector cell phenotype indeed correlated with elevated levels of mRNA for T cell derived pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and IL-2 ( Figure 2D) . Although there is no evidence suggesting peripheral virus replication during persistent infection, the presence of JHMV within CNS-draining lymph nodes was indeed supported by detection of low levels of mRNA encoding the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein in control DTR − mice ( Figure 2D) . In contrast, increased T cell activation correlated with a reduction of viral N mRNA to below detection within CLN of DTR + mice at day 28 p.i. (Figure 2D ). Since IFN-γ has antiviral activity (31, 32) , elevated IFN-γ as a result of increased antiviral T cell activity in the absence of Treg is consistent with a decline in viral RNA.

To directly assess whether elevated T cell activation is antigen driven or more polyclonal in nature, we measured the frequencies of both virus-specific as well as SR CD4 + T cells in CLN following Foxp3 + Treg depletion. Frequencies of virus-specific CD4 + T cells, as analyzed by IFN-γ secreting cells following viral peptide M 133 stimulation, were not altered in DTR + compared to DTR − mice (Figure 3) . However, reflecting overall increased cellularity, their absolute numbers increased more than threefold (Figure 3) . We next assessed how Foxp3 + Tregs regulate SR-specific CD4 + T cells in CLN. Similar to virus-specific CD4 + T cells, myelin-specific endogenous CD4 + T cells are activated in CLN, albeit at later times correlating with demyelination (13) . More importantly, APC presenting myelin Ag are present in CLN of chronically infected mice (13) . Analysis of SR IFN-γ-secreting MOG 35−55 and MBP 60−80 specific CD4 + T cell frequencies revealed a threefold increase following Foxp3 + Treg depletion compared to the very low frequencies in DT-treated DTR − mice (~30 cells per 10 6 CLN cells; Figure 3 ). Higher frequencies of SR T cells thus correlated with an overall ninefold increase of MOG 35−55 and MBP 60−80 specific CD4 + T cell numbers within the CLN of DTR + mice compared to controls (Figure 3) . These data indicated that Foxp3 + Tregs unspecifically regulate overall CLN cellularity and T cell activation during JHMV persistence but specifically limit expansion of SR CD4 T cells emerging after onset of demyelination. (20) . Surprisingly however, Foxp3 + Treg depletion altered neither total CNS cellular infiltration ( Figure 4A ) nor frequencies of inflammatory leukocytes ( Figure 4B ) at d28 p.i. Percentages of CD11b + , CD4 + , and CD8 + T cells, including virus-specific CD8 + , all remained similar irrespective of Foxp3 + Treg depletion (Figures 4C,D) . T cell activation in the CNS cannot readily be deduced by their phenotype as the majority of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells express a CD44 + CD62L low CD69 + effector phenotype throughout infection (27) . Nevertheless, as anticipated, we found no phenotypic T cell differences in DT-treated DTR − compared to DTR + mice (data not shown). Similar overall T cell effector function was supported by identical levels of mRNA encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and IL-2 in both brain and spinal cord ( Figure 4E) . No apparent differences in T cell numbers or function were also reflected in identical levels of persisting viral mRNA in both brains and spinal cords ( Figure 4F) . These data indicated that viral persistence was not regulated by Foxp3 + Tregs, distinct from CLN. Finally, no overt differences in demyelination in Foxp3 + Treg ablated mice indicated a minor, if any, role of this Treg subset in CNS tissue damage ( Figure 4G) . These data demonstrated that Foxp3 + Tregs control T cell activation and inflammatory responses within CLN but have no effect on CNS inflammation and pathology during chronic JHMV infection.

While neither CNS antiviral function nor demyelination were affected by Foxp3 + Treg depletion, a potential increase in virus-specific and SR CD4 + T cells may be unapparent due to their low frequencies in the CNS. Specifically, SR CD4 + T cell frequencies are low within the CNS, although higher than in CLN (13) . To verify that their increased numbers in CLN do not lead to enhanced circulation and recruitment to the CNS, we used ELISPOT to determine frequencies of both virus-specific and SR T cells in the CNS. Frequencies as well as total numbers of IFN-γ secreting M 133 -specific CD4 + T cells were indeed similar in the CNS of both groups (Figure 5) . Contrasting the CLN, both frequencies and total numbers of IFN-γ secreting MOG 35−55 -and MBP 60−80 -specific CD4 + T cells were also identical within the CNS of DT-treated DTR − and DTR + mice ( Figure 5) . These data were consistent with similar demyelination and supported a limited role for Foxp3 + Tregs in controlling the CNS SR CD4 + T cell response during chronic JHMV infection.

Increased T cell numbers and activation within CLN after Foxp3 + Treg depletion, but no differences in the CNS, implicated impaired T cell trafficking. Following JHMV infection, T cell migration to the CNS is regulated by CXCR3, as well as CCR2 and CCR5 (33) (34) (35) . However, expression of their respective ligands, CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL2, and CCL5 was not affected by Foxp3 + Treg ablation within brain or spinal cord ( Figure 6A) . However, Foxp3 + Tregs have been reported to limit inflammatory chemokine expression within draining lymph nodes, thereby promoting T cell egress (36) . Elevated T cell activation and IFN-γ mRNA in CLN were indeed associated with significantly increased levels of IFN-γ inducible CXCL9 and CXCL10 mRNA levels in CLN of Foxp3 + Treg depleted DTR + mice (Figure 6B) . Similarly, CXCR3 expression on CD4 + T cells was upregulated in CLN ( Figure 6C ). By contrast, there were no differences in CCL2 and CCL5 mRNA expression (Figure 6B) , indicating a preferential increase of IFN-γ regulated chemokines (37, 38) . These results supported the notion that enhanced and/or prolonged interaction of CXCR3 ligand expressing APC with CXCR3 + T cells may promote retention, thereby limiting T cell egress into circulation (39) . Overall, these results indicate that Foxp3 + Tregs mediate suppressive function primarily within CLN and are more potent at controlling peripheral SR T cell activation than virus-specific T cells during chronic JHMV infection. reduced Tr1 cell response correlates with increased cns sr T cells Unaltered SR T cell responses within the CNS of DT-treated DTR + mice indicated a Foxp3-independent component regulating the CNS autoimmune response during chronic JHMV infection. In addition to Foxp3 + Tregs, IL-10-producing Tr1 cells also regulate autoimmune responses, including during MS (40, 41) . Tr1 cells are drastically reduced in JHMV-infected mice deficient in IL-27 signaling, a cytokine promoting Tr1 cell response (15) . Analysis of IL-27R −/− mice further demonstrated that IL-27 does not play a pro-inflammatory role or significantly alter CD8 T cell function during JHMV infection but is rather a major regulator of the Tr1 response (15) . Myelin-specific CD4 + T cell responses were therefore compared in infected WT and IL-27R −/− mice at d30 p.i., the peak of the SR T cell response (13) . Opposing the results in Foxp3 + Treg depleted mice, frequencies and numbers of both virus-and myelin-specific CD4 + T cells were similar within CLN of IL-27R −/− mice compared to controls ( Figure 7A) . Furthermore, frequencies of both virus-specific and SR CD4 + T cells were significantly increased within the CNS of IL-27R −/− mice compared to WT mice ( Figure 7B) . Interestingly, alteration of CD4 + T cell frequencies in the absence of Tr1 cells was more prominent for myelin-specific compared to virus-specific T cells (fivefold versus twofold, respectively), indicating preferential action on SR T cells. Moreover, despite similar overall inflammatory cell numbers, numbers of virus and SR CD4 + T cells were increased in the absence of Tr1 cells ( Figure 7B ). Tr1 cells thus do not appear to regulate peripheral SR CD4 + T cell responses but act preferentially within the CNS during chronic JHMV infection. These data indicate that regulation of SR CD4 + T cell response during chronic JHMV infection is dependent upon Tr1 cells within the CNS, contrasting the specific role of Foxp3 + Tregs within CLN.

Viral infections have long been associated with the induction and reoccurrence of autoimmune attacks, including MS (1). Nevertheless, a firm association between virus and MS remains elusive, as active viral replication has thus far never been detected within CNS tissue of MS patients. On the other side, a protective role of viral infections against autoimmune diseases has also been proposed (8) , but the mechanisms preventing autoimmunity after viral infections remain largely unknown. Among MS murine models, JHMV infection reproduces several aspects of MS pathogenesis (12) . Importantly, tissue damage occurs temporally remote from viral infection as indicated by peak demyelination after elimination of infectious virus (12) . Moreover, lesion size is constrained by IL-10 during persistence independent of viral load (42) . Lastly, myelin loss correlates with the peripheral activation of myelin-specific CD4 + T cells, which access the CNS but decline with time despite ongoing demyelination (13) . The apparent control of the endogenous SR T cells suggested suppressive mechanisms prevent ascending clinical autoimmune disease during persistent infection. JHMV infection thus represents a unique model to assess how viral infection may prevent autoimmunity. As Foxp3 + Tregs are among the regulatory mechanisms dampening JHMV pathogenesis, their implication in controlling SR CD4 + T cells was of particular interest. The data herein are novel in demonstrating that Foxp3 + Treg abrogation during persistence preferentially enhanced endogenously primed, peripheral SR CD4 + T cells but had no effect on CNS localized SR T cells or tissue damage during chronic JHMV infection. These observations are consistent with a previous report by Trandem et al. (20) showing that naive Foxp3 + Tregs adoptively transferred into acutely JHMV-infected mice were not detected within the CNS but rather exerted prominent function within CLN by dampening dendritic cell activation, T cell proliferation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Foxp3 + Treg dependent downregulation of CLN inflammatory response thus correlated with limited CNS inflammation and demyelination without affecting viral persistence (20) . Our results on regulation of SR T cells during persistence also corroborated control of transferred SR CD4 + T cell proliferation by Foxp3 + Tregs during a heterologous MHV infection (21) . A primary role of Foxp3 + Tregs within draining lymph nodes was also observed in other infectious models, as well as during cancer and autoimmunity (36, (43) (44) (45) . Nevertheless, our data differ from results by Trandem et al. with respect to the direct correlation between decreased peripheral inflammation by Foxp3 + Tregs with decreased CNS cellular infiltration and demyelination. Despite extensive expansion of the inflammatory response within the CLN of mice depleted of Foxp3 + Tregs during persistence, no alteration of CNS inflammation or tissue damage was evident. These differences may reside in the differential properties of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) between acute and chronic JHMV infection, as BBB permeability is restored to naive levels after day 14 p.i. (46) , thus potentially limiting effector T cell access into the CNS after Foxp3 + Treg depletion. Further, enlarged CLN associated with increased chemokine expression indicated restricted T cell egress is responsible for the lack of altered CNS inflammation. Retention of effector T cells within the draining lymph nodes following Foxp3 + Treg depletion was also observed during herpes simplex viral (HSV) infection. In this model, Treg-mediated suppression of chemokine production within lymph nodes facilitated effector T cell egress and trafficking to the infection site (36) . While a similar mode of Treg action is supported by our studies, Treg supplementation, rather than depletion, enhanced chemokine production and T effector cell retention in lymph nodes during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), thereby diminishing CNS T cell migration (47) . All together, these diverse CNS inflammation models suggest that Foxp3 + Treg can modulate effector T cells in draining lymph nodes both at the expansion phase as well as egress phase. The relative balance between expansion and local cytokine/ chemokine expression then ultimately determines egress into circulation and access to the CNS.

Irrespective of the overall common suppressive action in draining LN during viral infection, the function of endogenous Foxp3 + Treg migrating to and residing in the CNS throughout persistence remains obscure. Despite the prolonged reduction of Tregs by DT-mediated depletion, we found no evidence of altered pathogenesis. Regulation of the CNS autoimmune responses by Foxp3 + Tregs is also ineffective during EAE (48) . Despite Foxp3 + Treg accumulation within the inflamed CNS, their functions were abrogated by pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF. Expression of both cytokines during JHMV infection (49) suggests they may have similar suppressive activity on local Foxp3 + Treg. Alternatively, a potential deficit of Foxp3 + Treg access to CNS demyelinating lesions, with perivascular retention, may explain their inability to regulate CNS inflammation and will require further investigation. It is also possible that residual Foxp3 + Tregs detected 1 week after DT treatment may be sufficient to control CNS inflammation. The minor Foxp3 + Treg population detected at day 28 p.i. presumably comprises rebound Tregs, as well as a small proportion of DT insensitive Foxp3 + cells detected in adult DEREG mice (23) . While rebound Tregs are dysfunctional (28), DT-resistant Foxp3 + Tregs have been shown to protect against lethal autoimmunity and may thus suffice to control the SR CD4 + T cells during chronic JHMV infection (23) . It nevertheless remains intriguing that residual Foxp3 + Tregs in CLN appear to exert more potent suppressive capacities than in the CNS. In contrast to the lack of Foxp3 + Treg suppressive function within the CNS, IL-27R −/− mice displayed increased virus and SR CD4 + T cell responses, implicating Tr1 cells as a major regulator of CNS inflammation during chronic JHMV infection. Impaired IL-27 signaling was associated with decreased IL-10 + virus-specific CD4 + T cells and delayed viral control (15) . The present results indeed confirmed that Tr1 cells dampened the virus-specific Th1 cell response within the CNS. However, a greater increase of SR CD4 + T cells was observed in the CNS of IL-27R −/− mice, indicating that Tr1 cells are also critical in limiting autoimmunity during chronic JHMV infection. It remains to be determined whether Tr1 cells restricting SR CD4 + T cell response during chronic JHMV infection are myelin-specific, as Tr1 regulatory function efficacy was shown to be dependent upon antigen specificity (50, 51) . The mechanisms associated with Tr1-dependent suppression of CNS SR T cells may involve IL-10 secretion, granzyme B, and perforin production, inhibitory molecule expression, or metabolic regulation (52) . Finally, the implication of SR CD4 + T cells in promoting tissue damage and clinical autoimmunity during JHMV infection remain unclear, as increased myelin-specific CD4 + T cells in IL-27R −/− mice correlated with a moderate decrease, rather than expected increase in demyelination (15) . It cannot be excluded that despite their increased frequency, the overall low numbers of myelin-specific CD4 + T cells are insufficient to achieve effector threshold levels required to affect myelin loss or tissue damage. Prolonged studies may be necessary to reveal altered tissue damage, as demyelination in IL-27R −/− mice was quantified only until day 30 p.i. (15) . It also remains a possibility that compensatory mechanisms occur in the absence of Tr1 cells. IL-10 is critical in limiting demyelination during JHMV persistence and is produced by both Foxp3 + Tregs and Tr1 cells. Surprisingly however, no difference in IL-10 mRNA levels was detected between WT and IL-27R −/− mice during chronic JHMV infection (42) , indicating another cell type may compensate for the lack of Tr1 cells.

Altogether, our study demonstrates the importance of distinct Treg populations in controlling SR T cells both at the induction and effector site during chronic encephalomyelitis. These are the

Influenza is one of the most common vaccine-preventable viral diseases, with the highest morbidity reported for children and elderly patients [1, 2] . Influenza infections during childhood usually present as mild respiratory upper airway disease, but severe complications and fatalities also occur, especially in children less than 2 years of age and in children with underlying chronic conditions [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . However, 40-50 % of influenza-associated fatalities occur in previously healthy children [4, 8] .

Before the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic in 2009/ 2010, comparisons of clinical characteristics between patients infected with different influenza types (A vs. B) and between patients infected with different influenza A subtypes showed only small differences when controlling for age [9, 10] . During the pandemic, however, some studies observed increased morbidity and mortality among children compared to previous seasonal influenza [6, [11] [12] [13] , while other studies described the clinical features of A(H1N1)pdm09 as being similar or even milder [14, 15] . Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and fatal viral pneumonia was observed more frequently during the pandemic [16] . Post-pandemic surveillance was recommended, as circulation of A(H1N1)pdm09 was expected to continue for several years, gradually assuming a seasonal influenza pattern [16] .

In Germany, influenza sentinel surveillance on outpatients of all ages [17] confirmed that the first postpandemic season 2010/11 was dominated by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (62 %), co-circulating with influenza B (37 %) whereas A(H3N2) was rare (<1 %). During the second season 2011/12, A(H1N1)pdm09 was rare (1 %), whereas A(H3N2) was diagnosed in 75 % of cases and co-circulated with influenza B (24 %). In the third season 2012/13, all three types/subtypes co-circulated in similar proportions (34 % A(H1N1)pdm2009, 31 % A(H3N2), and 35 % B).

Information on the incidence and clinical characteristics of severe paediatric influenza resulting in intensive care treatment and/or fatal outcome is still limited in Germany, and post-pandemic data is thus far available only for the season 2010/11 [18] [19] [20] . Based on cases recorded by a nation-wide paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) reporting system, the pre-pandemic (2005/06-2007/08), pandemic (2009/10) and post-pandemic (2010/ 11) annual incidence of severe influenza cases per 100,000 children below 15 or 17 years of age was estimated as 0.05, 0.8-1.0, and 0.4, respectively [18] [19] [20] . The data so far available indicated a shift towards younger children in A(H1N1)pdm09 cases from the pandemic to the first post-pandemic season [20] . In these studies, it remained unclear whether the higher pandemic and post-pandemic incidence in children was caused by higher influenza activity, heightened physician awareness, more frequent or more sensitive influenza testing, or a more severe course of disease of A(H1N1)pdm09 [18] . Furthermore, all these previous studies may have been affected by underreporting, as influenza cases were reported at the discretion of the PICU physician without systematic screening for influenza in patients with severe acute respiratory infection.

In the study presented here, we used active screening to estimate the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenzaassociated PICU admissions in one of Germany's largest federal states during the first three post-pandemic seasons. Furthermore, we described the clinical characteristics of influenza PICU patients and compared patients with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 disease between the post-pandemic seasons.

Prospective, active surveillance was conducted in PICUs of paediatric hospitals in Bavaria, Germany. On December 31 st , 2010 roughly 2,001,700 children <17 years of age were registered in Bavaria [21] , representing 16 % of the German population in this age group [22] . The annual study population was defined as the sub-group of all children in Bavaria at least 1 month and <17 years of age.

All 30 paediatric hospitals in Bavaria equipped for paediatric intensive care treatment of children older than 1 month of age were invited to participate. These PICUs reported a total of 432 intensive care beds (median 14, IQR [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] , including 207 beds (median 9, IQR 6-12) equipped with ventilation facilities. , all patients who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria were enrolled: i) admission to a participating PICU with suspected acute respiratory infection (ARI) of the upper or lower respiratory tract, with ARIrelated symptoms (for example, coryza, cough, or sore throat); ii) age at PICU admission due to ARI at least 1 month and below 17 years of age; iii) parental written informed consent. Enrolled children with PCR-confirmed influenza were classed as influenza-associated ARI.

The PICU physician documented demographic characteristics, underlying chronic medical conditions, influenza vaccination status, diagnostic findings, ARI-associated diagnoses and complications, treatment, duration of hospital and PICU stay, and outcome in a structured questionnaire. A respiratory sample, usually a flocked nasopharyngeal or pharyngeal swab, was collected on the day of PICU admission for PCR-confirmation of influenza. Microbiological testing for bacteria or fungi was at the discretion of the PICU physician; pathogens detected at usually sterile sites or in tracheal aspirates were classified as bacterial or fungal co-infection.

PCR confirmation of influenza was performed either at the local laboratories of the participating PICUs using influenza-specific PCR, or (in the majority of cases) at the central laboratory at the Institute of Virology and Immunobiology of the University of Würzburg using multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses. For the latter, respiratory samples were placed in a viral transport medium (Mast Diagnostica GmbH, Reinfeld, Germany). At the central laboratory, they were tested using the commercial multiplex PCR 'FTD® Respiratory pathogens 21' (Fast Track Diagnostics, Luxembourg) to screen for respiratory viruses (sensitivity and specificity of 99-100 % compared to singleplex PCR assays for all included viruses in clinical samples). Pathogens detected by the test kit included influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1-4, coronavirus (CoV) NL63, OC43, HKU1, and 229E, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (hBoV), adenovirus (AdV), rhinovirus (RhV), enterovirus (EV), parechovirus (PV), and additionally Mykoplasma pneumoniae. Samples positive for influenza A and B virus RNA in the multiplex PCR were further analysed to determine the subtype and lineage, respectively. Primers and probes specific for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 were included in the 'FTD Respiratory pathogens 21' kit. All samples positive for influenza A virus RNA but negative for influenza A virus (H1N1)pdm09 RNA were tested by a PCR specific for influenza A virus H3.

All data was entered into a Microsoft Access database and transferred to IBM SPSS 21.0 for statistical analysis. Data was analysed descriptively (percentages, or median with inter-quartile range, IQR). Comparisons between groups were assessed for significance (p < 0.05, twosided) using Pearson's Chi 2 -test or Fisher's Exact test for categorical data, and the Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous data.

The minimum incidence of influenza-associated PICU admissions per 100,000 children <17 years of age was calculated for each season based on the observed number of influenza PICU patients with a residential address in Bavaria. To correct for non-participating PICUs, the estimates of the total number of PICU influenza cases treated in all eligible PICUs in Bavaria per season were derived taking into account the annual percentage of participating PICUs. The annual study population was used as denominator.

A similar questionnaire and case definition had been used in previous studies on influenza-related PICU admission [18, 19] . Key variables were extracted from these publications for comparison purposes. Data from Streng et al. [18] and the present study were pooled for statistical comparison of pre-and post-pandemic seasons.

The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical Faculty, University of Würzburg, Germany. 

Based on the observed cases, the minimum incidence for PCR-confirmed influenza-associated PICU admission per 100,000 children <17 years of age in Bavaria was calculated as 1.15/0.36/1.03 for seasons 1/2/3, respectively. Taking into account that the observed cases were based on data from 67 %/47 %/57 % of all eligible PICUs, the total number of influenza-associated PICU admissions in Bavaria was estimated and corrected incidences were calculated as 1.72/0.76/1.80 per 100,000 children <17 years. Subtype-specific corrected incidences were 1. 35 (Table 2) .

After onset of ARI symptoms, children were admitted to hospital after a median interval of 3.0 days; 83 % were transferred to the PICU on the day of hospital admission or the following day (Table 2) . Two long-term hospitalized children (4.2 %) required PICU treatment due to ARI and were diagnosed with suspected nosocomial influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. Median length of PICU stay was 3.0 days and median length of total hospital stay was 7.5 days (Table 2) .

Underlying chronic medical conditions were reported for a total of 36 influenza PICU patients (76.6 %) ( Table 3) . Chronic neurological diseases were most frequent (34.0 %), followed by chronic lung disease (25.5 %), preterm birth (21.3 %), cardiac malformations (17.0 %), obesity (10.6 %), genetic disorders (8.5 %), and immunocompromising conditions (8.5 %).

Of 36 influenza PICU patients with underlying chronic conditions, four (11.1 %) were too young (<6 months of age) to have been immunized against influenza, and for two patients (5.6 %), data on their influenza vaccination status was unavailable. Twenty-nine (80.6 %) patients from this risk group had not been vaccinated against influenza although they would have been eligible. One immunocompromised child (2.8 %) had been vaccinated in October 2012, but was diagnosed with A(H3N2) in January 2013.

One or more specific influenza-associated diagnoses/complications were reported for 42 (89.4 %) of the 47 children ( Table 4 ). The most frequent diagnosis was influenzaassociated pneumonia (61.7 %), followed by bronchitis/ bronchiolitis (31.9 %), and secondary bacterial pneumonia (25.5 %). ARDS was reported for 10 (21.3 %) and sepsis for six children (12.8 %); other complications were rare. Thirty-nine of the 47 patients (83.0 %) underwent a chest radiograph.

In addition to influenza, laboratory-confirmed co-infections were reported for 16 children (34.0 % out of 47 (1)).

The majority of the 47 PICU patients were treated intravenously with antibiotics (72.3 %), and with antipyretics (70.2 %) ( 

Five children (10.6 %), infected with A(H1N1)pdm09, died at an age of 4 to 11 years; four were male patients ( Table 6 ). Four of these children suffered both from severe neurological conditions (two children with previous peripartal asphyxia and spastic tetraparesis; one child with cerebral paresis and tetraspasticity; one child with congenital cerebral disorder), and from chronic pulmonary conditions; two of these four children were also born pre-term. Influenza-associated pneumonia was diagnosed in all four of these children; three additionally had secondary bacterial pneumonia, and one child also developed sepsis. For the fifth child, obesity was reported as the only risk factor; and sepsis and suspected encephalitis as complications. Bacterial co-pathogens were detected in three of these five children and suspected in one child; two viral and two fungal co-infections were also reported. All five children received intratracheal ventilation, antibiotics and catecholamines; two were additionally treated with antiviral medication. Death occurred 1, 2, 4, 19, and 26 days after PICU admission, with ARDS reported as cause of death in three children. Sequelae were reported for five patients (10.6 %): state after surgery due to pleural effusion/empyema in two children; increased oxygen requirements in two children who had previously already received oxygen therapy at home; damage of the lung after high-pressure ventilation in one child. Table 2 ). Figure 1 shows the difference in age distribution between both seasons, and the high proportion of children below 2 years of age as opposed to low proportions in all other age groups in season 3. After onset of symptoms, children were admitted to a PICU after a significantly shorter period, with a median of 3 days (IQR 1-4) in season 1 compared to 6 days (IQR 2.0-7.5) in season 3 ( Table 2 ). In season 1, significantly fewer children were diagnosed with bronchitis/bronchiolitis (Table 4 ), and they tended to require CPAP treatment less frequently than in season 3 (11.1 % vs. 41.7 %, p = 0.084, Table 5 ).

In the pre-pandemic period, median duration of PICU stay was longer (19 days) , and children were more often diagnosed with encephalitis/encephalopathy (25 %) and co-infections (65 %) than in later periods ( Table 7) . The proportion of children with influenza-associated pneumonia was highest (74 %) during the pandemic, whereas secondary bacterial pneumonia (17 %), bronchitis/ bronchiolitis (12 %) and sepsis (6 %) were reported less frequently during the pandemic than in the pre-and post-pandemic seasons. Oseltamivir treatment decreased significantly in the post-pandemic period (Table 7) .

During the first three post-pandemic seasons 2010/11, 2011/12 and 2012/13, active screening of children with acute respiratory infection admitted to 24 paediatric intensive care units in Bavaria identified a total of 51 PCR-confirmed influenza cases, resulting in annual incidence estimates of 1.7, 0.7, and 1.8 influenza-associated PICU admissions per 100,000 children, respectively. These figures would, by extrapolation, correspond to a total number of 559 children with influenza-associated PICU admission in Germany within the 3-year post-pandemic period, with an annual average of 186 children. This is almost 28 times as high as the annual average of six to seven influenza-associated PICU admissions detected by nation-wide PICU surveillance in Germany during three pre-pandemic years without active screening [18] . Furthermore, the incidence estimates for the subtype A(H1N1)pdm09 derived from our active screening study were higher in the first and third post-pandemic seasons (1.35 and 1.17, respectively) than previous incidence estimates for PICU patients in the pandemic (0.8-1.0) and the first post-pandemic (approximately 0.4) season in Germany [19, 20] . Thus, our results indicate possible underreporting in previous studies, and show a continued high level of A(H1N1)pdm09-associated PICU admissions even 3 years after the pandemic. In our study, the proportions of children with bacteriaassociated complications (secondary bacterial pneumonia, sepsis) were similar to the proportions observed during the pre-pandemic period, but appeared higher than those observed during the pandemic 2009/10 [19] . The lower proportions observed during the pandemic might be explained by the time shift of the peak of influenza cases, which was observed as early as November 2009 in Germany [19] . Thus, the pandemic influenza peak did not coincide with the seasonal peak of Streptococcus pneumoniae, the bacterial pathogen most frequently associated with community-acquired influenza [23] . Antiviral treatment patterns changed considerably during the post-pandemic period, with a decrease in the proportion of paediatric influenza cases receiving oseltamivir from previously 50 % [18] and 61 % [19] to 19 %. Oseltamivir is considered to be most advantageous when administered within the first 48 h of influenza disease. The reduced use in the post-pandemic period may therefore be partly due to the fact that median time between onset of influenza symptoms and PICU admission was longer than during the pandemic (3 vs. 2 days [19] ). Increasing uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of oseltamivir in the treatment of paediatric influenza may also have played a role [24, 25] . Post-pandemic oseltamivir treatment was associated with co-infections and longer PICU stay, suggesting that it were mainly children with severe complications or with serious underlying conditions who received this medication.

In our study, about two-thirds of influenza cases and all fatalities were A(H1N1)pdm09-associated. During the postpandemic seasons 1/2/3, the proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09 cases among the PICU patients was 79 %/14 %/65 % and, thus, considerably higher than the proportion of this subtype reported among outpatients by national influenza surveillance (65 %/1 %/34 %) [17] . This observation suggests that A(H1N1)pdm09 may be associated more often with a severe course of influenza requiring PICU treatment than other influenza types/ subtypes. Similar observations on the proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09-associated PICU admissions have been reported in the United States [9] .

Comparison of PICU patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 between the post-pandemic seasons showed that median age was 1.7 years in the third season and, thus, significantly lower than in the first season. A significant age shift towards younger children, from a median age of 5 to 3 years, had already been observed in a comparison of the pandemic and the first post-pandemic season in Germany [20] . The continued shift towards younger patients in the third season is likely to be due to increasing immunity in the older paediatric population, after previous contact with A(H1N1)pdm09. Seroprevalence data from Germany had already shown evidence for A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in as many as 25 % of children aged 1-4 years and 48 % of 5-17 year-old children for the pandemic season 2009/10 [26] . A similar shift towards younger hospitalized children [27, 28] and towards younger children with severe paediatric A(H1N1)pdm09-associated influenza from the pandemic season to the first post-pandemic season had also been detected in other European countries [28] [29] [30] [31] .

In Germany, paediatric influenza vaccination for pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was recommended and funded for all children as monovalent vaccination from October 2009 to July 2010 [32] . For seasonal influenza, however, paediatric influenza vaccination was and is currently recommended only for specific risk groups with underlying chronic conditions [33] . Vaccination uptake was low, even in this target group. Pre-pandemic vaccination rates were 5 % for all children and about 15 % for children with chronic underlying conditions in 2007/2008 [34] . For the pandemic and post-pandemic seasons, no data on vaccination rates is available for children, but vaccination rates as low as 14 % (2009/10) and 11 % (2010/11) were reported for adults, with a vaccination rate of only 17 % even for risk group adults [35] . In our study, more than 75 % of influenzaassociated PICU patients were children with underlying chronic conditions. Analysis of their reported influenza [20] ). Data are given in %, by age group and season. Season 1: Oct10-Sep11 (n = 18), Season 3: Oct12-Sep13 (n = 13); Season 2: Oct11-Sep12 (n = 1) is not shown vaccination status showed that among these were a high proportion of vaccine-eligible but unvaccinated children. Patients with chronic conditions too young to be vaccinated and other paediatric risk groups, such as otherwise healthy children below 2 years of age, are not covered by the current German recommendation. All these groups could profit considerably from universal influenza vaccination for children, either directly or by herd protection. In contrast to the situation in Germany, in the United States universal influenza vaccination for all children older than 6 months of age has been established, and vaccination coverage reached a level of approximately 41 % in 2013 [36] . Compared to 348 influenza-associated paediatric deaths observed in the United States during the pandemic 2009/10, only 79 were observed in the strong A(H1N1)pdm09 season 2013/14 [37] . This might partly be explained by increasing immunity in children after previous A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, but may in part also be a result of the influenza vaccination program [37] . In England, a universal childhood vaccination programme with a new live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) with intra-nasal application was started in the 2013/14 influenza season [38] . First results showed an overall uptake of 53 % in primary school aged children, indicating a good acceptance of LAIV, and suggesting direct and indirect impacts on disease incidence, including reduction of paediatric influenza-associated hospitalisations.

To our knowledge, our study is the first in Europe to investigate paediatric influenza in PICU patients during the first three post-pandemic seasons after the 2009/10 pandemic. The strengths of our study include the multicentre design covering the majority of PICUs in Bavaria, the active screening for influenza in patients admitted to PICUs, and PCR-confirmation of all influenza cases. A limitation is that the corrected incidence estimates were based on the assumption that participating and nonparticipating PICUs treated a similar number of severe paediatric influenza patients. Although PICUs of both groups were of similar size, some of the non-participating PICUs, where paediatricians indicated lack of time as reason for non-participation, may have treated a higher number of patients, or patients with higher acuity. Further limitations include potential over-and underreporting in participating PICUs. On the one hand, due to different hospitalization rules some children may have been admitted to PICUs mainly for the purpose of monitoring their course of influenza disease more closely, thus resulting in an overestimate of severe cases. On the other hand, some parents of children with severe influenza may have refused study participation, or children with a fulminant course of influenza disease may have died before they were admitted to a PICU [4] . Thus, the high incidence estimates derived in this study may still underestimate the true burden of severe influenza. [19] b Key data from this study were pooled with data from Streng et al. 2011 [18] and compared using Fisher's Exact test or Mann-Whitney U-test, respectively

The incidence estimates of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09associated PICU admissions, derived from active screening of PICU patients with acute respiratory infections, reached similarly high levels in the first and third postpandemic seasons. Both incidence estimates were higher than those previously reported by nation-wide PICU surveillance for the pandemic and the first post-pandemic season, suggesting possible underreporting in previous studies without active screening. Comparison of the first and third post-pandemic seasons indicated an age shift of severe A(H1N1)pdm09 towards younger children, which might be explained by increasing immunity in the older paediatric population. The large proportion of children with underlying chronic conditions indicates the need for a more consistent implementation of the current recommendations for influenza vaccination of specific risk groups in Germany. These children could also profit from herd protection, if universal influenza vaccination was successfully introduced in Germany.

The ORF2 glycoprotein of hepatitis E virus inhibits cellular NF-κB activity by blocking ubiquitination mediated proteasomal degradation of IκBα in human hepatoma cells

Background: Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is a key transcription factor that plays a crucial role in host survival during infection by pathogens. Therefore, it has been a priority of many pathogens to manipulate the cellular NF-κB activity in order to create a favorable environment for their survival inside the host.

Results: We observed that heterologous expression of the open reading frame 2 (ORF2) protein in human hepatoma cells led to stabilization of the cellular I kappa B alpha (IκBα) pool, with a concomitant reduction in the nuclear localization of the p65 subunit of NF-κB and inhibition of NF-κB activity. Although basal or TPA induced phosphorylation of IκBα was not altered, its ubiquitination was markedly reduced in ORF2 expressing cells. Further analysis revealed that ORF2 protein could directly associate with the F-box protein, beta transducin repeat containing protein (βTRCP) and ORF2 over expression resulted in reduced association of IκBα with the SKP1 and CUL1 components of the SCF βTRCP complex. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay of the proximal promoter regions of MHC-I heavy chain and IL-8 genes using p65 antibody and LPS stimulated ORF2 expressing cell extract revealed decreased association of p65 with the above regions, indicating that ORF2 inhibited p65 binding at endogenous promoters. Conclusions: In this report we suggest a mechanism by which ORF2 protein of HEV may inhibit host cell NF-κB activity during the course of a viral infection.

Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is a crucial transcription factor regulating multiple cellular pathways leading to survival or death of the cell depending on the stimulus. In unstimulated cells, the NF-κB dimers (p50/p65 heterodimer or p50/p50 homodimer) are retained in the cytoplasm in an inactive form as a consequence of their association with members of another family of proteins called I kappa B (IκB). Upon stimulation by activators like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1 (IL-1), CD40L, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) etc., signaling cascades involving activation of various protein kinases are initiated that result in the recruitment and activation of the IκB kinases (IKKs) which phosphorylate IκBα, leading to its degradation by the 26S proteasome complex. The degradation of IκBα exposes the p50/p65 nuclear localization sequence and allows NF-κB dimers to translocate to the nucleus, bind to κB motifs in the promoters regions of many genes, and regulate their transcription [1] .

In many cases, infection by extra-cellular pathogens has been shown to alter NF-κB activity in order to facilitate the survival of pathogens or host. As part of the host defense mechanism against invading pathogens, NF-κB activation is required for resistance to a variety of viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections [1] . However, many viruses such as HIV, exploit this property to their benefit by driving their gene expression through κB response elements located in their promoters [2] . On the contrary, many pathogens such as African swine fever virus, HIV-1 and cowpox virus [3] [4] [5] have developed strategies to interfere with host NF-κB responses. Inhibition of NF-κB activity by these pathogens has been shown to be important for pathogenesis.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a positive strand RNA virus which codes for three known open reading frames (ORFs) [6] . ORF1 codes for non structural proteins, essential for viral replication; ORF2 codes for the major capsid protein of HEV, called ORF2 protein; and ORF3 codes for a phosphoprotein which may play a key role in manipulating various host-cell processes during viral infection, and may have a role in cell survival and propagation of the virus [7, 8] . Although HEV infection is generally self-limiting, it induces fulminant hepatic failure, which results in a very high mortality rate in pregnant women. A recent study done by Prusty and coworkers has demonstrated that NF-κB activity is suppressed in the PBMC and liver biopsy samples of pregnant fulminant hepatic failure patients [9] . However, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unknown.

In the present study, we report the ability of the ORF2 protein to inhibit the cellular NF-κB activity. In human hepatoma cells, ORF2 protein could directly associate with the F-box protein βTRCP and heterologous expression of the ORF2 protein led to reduced recruitment of SKP1 and CUL1 subunits to the SCF βTRCP ubiquitination complex, resulting in decreased ubiquitination and degradation of the IκBα protein. This, in turn, led to reduced nuclear localization and subsequent DNA binding of the p65 protein, which is the major subunit of the NF-κB trans-activation complex. Analysis of two NF-κB target genes further confirmed the above observation. The possible significance of this phenomenon in enhancing survival of HEV infected hepatocytes is discussed.

In order to test whether ORF2 or ORF3 protein of HEV inhibit cellular NF-κB activity, a reporter vector with IL-2 receptor promoter region, which contains NF-κB element, cloned upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase coding sequence (NF-κB CAT; [10] was used. This vector was inducible by NF-κB activating agents like TPA or IL-1β. Huh7 cells were transiently transfected with the NF-κB CAT vector along with either ORF2 or ORF3 expression plasmids. Assay of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) activity using these cell extracts revealed that ORF2 protein inhibited the NF-κB CAT activity ( Figure 1A ). However, no inhibition was observed by ORF3 expression ( Figure 1A ). In order to investigate whether ORF2 mediated inhibition of NF-κB activity was an artifact of the experimental system, cells were treated for 30 minutes with Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA), a known inducer of NF-κB activity [11] , or transfected with an expression construct of IκB kinase β, which is the catalytic subunit of the IKK complex that acts as a constitutively active inducer of NF-κB activity [12] . TPA treatment increased NF-κB activity of mock transfected cells by approximately 4 folds whereas ORF2 expressing cells did not show any significant increase in NF-κB activity ( Figure 1A) . Similarly, co-expression of ORF2 in IKKβ transfected cells resulted in downregulation of NF-κB activity in comparison to cells transfected with only IKKβ ( Figure 1B) . These results clearly suggest that HEV ORF2 inhibits NF-κB activity.

Further, we examined the turnover of IκBα in IΚKβ and ORF2 co-expressing cells since IκBα is the major inhibitor of NF-κB activity in unstimulated cells. By performing a pulse chase assay, using [ 35 S]-cys/met labeling mix, the half-life of IκBα in IKKβ expressing cells was found to be approximately 90 minutes, whereas in cells expressing both IKKβ and ORF2, approximately 15% of Heterologous expression of ORF2 protein inhibits NF-κB activity. (A) Huh7 cells were cotransfected in duplicate with NF-κB CAT reporter and pSGI vector or pSGI-ORF2 expression plasmid. 48 hour post transfection, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml TPA for 30 minutes and CAT activity was assayed. Spot intensity was quantified using NIH Image program and percentage CAT activity was calculated assuming the highest value as 100%.

Graph represents mean ± SEM of 3 independent sets of experiments. (B) Huh7 cells were cotransfected in duplicate with NF-κB CAT reporter, IKKβ expression plasmid and pSGI vector or pSGI ORF2 expression plasmid. 48 hour post transfection, CAT activity was assayed. Graph represents mean ± SEM of 3 independent sets of experiments.

IκBα was found to be degraded at a chase period of 90 minutes ( Figure 2A) . Notably, the levels of IκBα at the end of the labeling period (0 minute chase) in IKKβ alone expressing cells were less than that in IKKβ and ORF2 coexpressing cells, indicating that IκBα is a very labile protein in IKKβ expressing cells. The graph represents quantitative measurement of band intensities of IκBα at the indicated time points assuming the band intensity at the onset of the chase as 100%. To further confirm whether IκBα stabilization actually blocked nuclear translocation of NF-κB in ORF2 expressing cells, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were separated in mock and ORF2 transfected cells and equal amounts of samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-p65 antibody. As seen in Figure 2B , ORF2 transfected cells were found to accumulate more p65 protein in the cytoplasmic fraction than in the nuclear fraction ( Figure 2B , lane 2 and 4; see the densitometric estimation of band intensities in the graph below). As expected, mock transfected cells were found to contain more p65 protein in the nuclear fraction ( Figure 2B , lane 1 and 3). This is attributed to the fact that basal NF-κB activity is higher in Huh7 cells [13] . In order to check the purity of fractions obtained in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions and as loading controls, equal amounts of both fractions from each sample were immunoblotted with anti-calnexin and anti-phospho c-Jun antibodies.

In order to check whether the phosphorylation of IκBα was altered in ORF2 expressing cells, the level of phosphorylated IκBα (ser32) was measured in ORF2 expressing cells. ORF2 expression marginally increased the levels of phospho IκBα ( Figure 2C , upper panel, lane 1 and 2; see the densitometric estimation of band intensities in the graph below) as well as the level of total IκBα (middle panel, lane 1 and 2). In IKKβ and ORF2 co-expressing cells, the level of total as well as phosphorylated IκBα was significantly higher as compared to only IKKβ expressing cells ( Figure 2C , lane 3 and 4). In order to check that the decreased band intensity in IKKβ expressing cells was due to accelerated degradation of IκBα, one set of cells were also treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 for 2 hours, resulting in equal IκBα protein levels in both the samples ( Figure 2C , lane 5 and 6). Aliquots of the sample were immunoblotted with anti-calnexin antibody to check equal loading. Thus, it appears that ORF2 expression prevents the degradation of IκBα. The fact that ORF2 did not interfere with phosphorylation of IκBα by the IKK complex was further confirmed by checking the activity of the IKK complex. ORF2 expressing cell lysate was immunoblotted for phospho IKKα/β (ser180/181) levels. As expected, ORF2 expression (2 or 4 μg plasmid DNA transfection) did not modulate the levels of pIKK α/β ( Figure 2D ).

Proteasomal degradation of IκBα is preceded by its ubiquitination, which occurs by the association of phosphorylated IκBα with the SCF βTRCP complex [14] . In order to check whether ORF2 inhibits IκBα ubiquitination, we checked the level of ubiquitinated IκBα in ORF2 expressing cells. Mock or ORF2 transfected cells were treated with MG-132 for 2 hours, IκBα was immunoprecipitated, followed by immunblotting with anti-ubiquitin antibody. Protein level of ubiquitinated IκBα was significantly decreased in full-length ORF2 expressing cells as compared to control cells ( Figure 3A top panel, lane 1 and 2) . A similar effect (lane 3) was observed following expression of a mutant ORF2 protein (Δ35) with ER signal sequence deleted which consequently constitutively localizes to the cytoplasm [15] . Aliquots of the immunoprecipitated lysate were immunoblotted with IκBα antibody to confirm its presence ( Figure 3A , middle panel). A parallel set of samples were labeled with [ 35 S]-cys/met promix, immunoprecipitated with anti-ORF2 antibody and autoradiographed to check the expression of full-length and Δ35 ORF2 protein ( Figure 3A, bottom panel) .

Subsequently, we checked whether ORF2 interfered with the assembly of IκBα ubiquitination machinery. Expression of ORF2 protein inhibited the association of IκBα with SKP1 ( Figure 3B Since the presence of ORF2 could inhibit IκBα association with full-length βTRCP but not with ΔF-βTRCP, we postulated that the ORF2 protein either interacts with IκBα and sequesters it away from βTRCP or interacts with other subunits of the SCF complex thereby modulating βTRCP binding to IκBα. Alternatively, it binds to βTRCP itself and blocks the formation of the SCF complex. We thus checked the association of ORF2 with the above components. No interaction was detected between ORF2 and IκBα ( Figure 3C , lane 6) as judged by coimmunoprecipitation assay. The possibility that βTRCP over-expression might be promoting ORF2 association with IκBα was ruled out by testing ORF2 and IκBα association in full-length or ΔF-βTRCP overexpressing cells ( Figure 3D, lane 7 and 8 ). Lane 1 shows the level of IκBα in control cells. Subsequently, we checked whether ORF2 interacts with SKP1 and CUL1. The ORF2 protein did not associate with either SKP1 or CUL1 ( Figure 3D, lane 1 and 2) under conditions, where IKBα associated with these proteins (lane 3).

Coimmunoprecipitation assay of cell lysate expressing both ORF2 and myc tagged full-length βTRCP revealed that ORF2 could efficiently associate with the latter ( Figure 4A, upper panel, lane 2) . Exposure of the same blot to X-ray film revealed the band specific to ORF2 in βTRCP and ORF2 cotransfected cells ( Figure 4A , lower panel, lane 2). 3 rd lane in upper panel shows the expression of the βTRCP protein, as judged by immunoprecipitation using anti-myc antibody. Specificity of the above interaction was further verified by checking for association of ORF2 with another F-box protein, SKP2. We were unable to detect any interaction between ORF2 and SKP2 as judged by coimmunoprecipitation assay ( Figure 4B, top panel) . In order to ensure that SKP2 was indeed functional in these experiments, the same blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-myc antibody. Endogenous SKP2 was able to coprecipitate endogenous as well as overexpressed c-myc protein ( Figure 4B , middle panel) and similarly IP using myc antibody revealed its interaction with the SKP2 protein ( Figure 4B transfected cells were labeled with [ 35 S]-cys/met promix and lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IκBα antibody, pre-immune serum (PS) or anti-ORF2 antibodies, respectively; subsequently, samples were immunoblotted with SKP1 and CUL1 antibodies. Same blot was air dried and exposed to X-ray film to check for ORF2 expression by autoradiography.

upper and middle panels). Bottom panel shows an autoradiogram of ORF2 expression. These experiments proved that ORF2 specifically interacts with the F-box protein βTRCP. Direct interaction between ORF2 and βTRCP was further confirmed using an in vitro pulldown assay. Full-length ORF2 as well as KDEL ORF2 (ORF2 protein containing "KDEL" amino acids at its C-terminal end, which allows it to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum instead of getting transported through the golgi) and Δ35 ORF2 mutant were able to pull-down βTRCP ( Figure 4C, lane 3, 4, 5) . As negative controls, ORF2 transfected sample was immunoprecipitated with pre-immune serum ( Figure 4C , lane 6) or mock translated lysate was incubated with ORF2 protein bound to beads ( Figure 4C, lane 2) or, the ORF3 protein was incubated with βTRCP protein ( Figure 4C, lane 7) .

NF-κB is known to regulate the transcription of a large number of genes during different cellular conditions. One of the most critical events for initiation of immune response against viral antigens is the presentation of viral peptide epitopes over the infected cell surface, Further, we checked NF-κB recruitment to the MHC I heavy chain promoter in LPS stimulated ORF2 expressing cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Immunoprecipitation was conducted using an antibody specific for the p65 subunit of the NF-κB complex. EGFP expression did not alter p65 recruitment to MHC-I heavy chain promoter. However, full-length or Δ35-ORF2 expression decreased p65 recruitment to the MHC-I heavy chain promoter. 10% of the total lysate used for one immuonprecipitation reaction was used as input in each sample ( Figure 5B, upper panel) . We also checked p65 recruitment to interleukin 8 (IL-8) proximal promoter region, which showed a similar pattern as observed for the MHC-I heavy chain promoter ( Figure 5B, lower panel) . As a control to check whether the observed phenomenon was specific for NF-κB, aliquots of the LPS treated lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-SP1 antibody (specific for SP1 transcription factor, which also binds to MHC-I heavy chain promoter) and purified ChIP DNA was PCR amplified using MHC-I heavy chain promoter specific primer. As expected, SP1 recruitment to the MHC-I heavy chain promoter was not altered in ORF2 expressing cells ( Figure 5C ). These experiments confirmed that ORF2 expression specifically prevents p65 NF-κB association with its cognate response element present on natural promoters.

Next, the effect of ORF2 protein on the expression of two TPA inducible cytokines-IL-6 and IL-8 was measured by performing real time quantitative RT-PCR of these cytokine transcripts in ORF2 expressing Huh7 cells, which were treated with TPA for 6 hours prior to RNA isolation. As expected, IL-6 and IL-8 transcript level was decreased in ORF2 expressing TPA treated cells in comparison to mock transfcetd TPA treated cells ( Figure 5D) . These experiments indicates that ORF2 protein, by virtue of its ability to inhibit NF-κB activity, suppress TPA induced IL-6 and IL-8 RNA synthesis.

The ORF2 protein of HEV has traditionally been believed to associate with genomic RNA, multimerize and form the viral capsid. No other function of ORF2 protein has yet been reported. In this article, we present evidence which suggest that the ORF2 protein may be playing an important regulatory role during the viral life cycle. The fact that the observed phenomenon was not an artifact of the experimental setup was evident from multiple experiments. First, ORF2 was capable of directly interacting with the F-box protein βTRCP, both in vitro and in vivo. Second, Δ35 ORF2 mutant that is unable to translocate to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), was also capable of inhibiting NF-κB activity, thus ruling out the possibility of ER stress induced artifact. Third, ORF3 protein of HEV was unable to elicit such a function in parallel experiments.

HEV infection results in an acute, self-limiting and icteric disease that is prevalent in much of the developing world. Although self-limiting infection occurs in adults with mortality rate~1-2%, a high 10-20% mortality rate is observed during pregnancy [6] . Hence it is important to understand the molecular mechanism by which HEV completes its life cycle inside the host. A recent study done by Prusty and coworkers revealed that NF-κB activity is inhibited in the PBMC and liver of fulminant hepatic failure patients [9] . Our findings that the ORF2 protein has the ability to inhibit NF-κB activity in human hepatoma cells provide a possible molecular explanation to their observation.

The NF-κB inhibitory activity of the ORF2 protein may be mediated by its ability to directly associate with the F-box protein βTRCP and inhibit the assembly of the IκBα ubiquitination complex. βTRCP is a cytoplasmic protein.

Hence it is worth speculating that the ORF2 βTRCP interaction would occur in the cytoplasm. Although ORF2 is an N-linked glycoprotein, which is cotranslationally translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum, recent studies performed in our laboratory have demonstrated that a fraction of ORF2 protein exploits the ER retro-translocation machinery to get access to the cytoplasm, where it is detected as a non-glycosylated protein. Importantly, in contrast to other retrotranslocated substrates, retrotranslocated ORF2 protein is not immediately degraded by the 26S proteasome complex present in the cytoplasm [16] . Thus, cytoplasm localized deglycosylated ORF2 protein may be able to associate with βTRCP. Indeed, experiments done using Δ35 ORF2 protein suggest that non-glycosylated, cytoplasm localized ORF2 protein is capable of associating with βTRCP and inhibiting NF-κB activity. Further studies need to be undertaken to verify the exact mechanism.

Expression of MHC class I heavy chain, which is known to be a transcriptional target of NF-κB, was down-regulated in LPS treated ORF2 expressing cells presumably due to reduced promoter occupancy of p65, which is crucial for NF-κB dependent transcriptional activation. In an infected cell, by default, pathogenic antigens are processed by the proteasome and presented by the MHC class I molecules so that the former can be recognized by cytolytic T cells. This helps in pathogen clearance at an early stage of infection. Thus, it is beneficial for any pathogen to escape this step. In fact, downregulation of MHC class I both at transcriptional and post-translational level is observed in many pathogenic infections [17] [18] [19] . Since NF-κB is one of the major transcription factors induced during pathogen infection that enhances gene expression of many chemokines and class I molecules in the infected cell, inhibition of the NF-κB activity by pathogen encoded proteins will ensure evasion of host immune response at an early stage; thus providing the pathogen a time window to establish successful infection.

Owing to its central role in regulating multiple cell signaling pathways, modulation of NFKB activity has been an attractive target of many viral factors in order to allow them to exploit the host cell signaling machinery to their benefit. We have identified the ability of the ORF2 protein of the HEV to inhibit host cell NFKB activity. However, whether such an event is recapitulated during the natural course of HEV infection and whether it is crucial for the virus induced pathogenic effects, can be answered only by performing similar experiments using a model organism infected with the wild type virus. Nevertheless, the present study confirms the NFKB inhibitory property of the HEV ORF2 protein and provides some evidence suggesting a plausible mechanism underlying this event.

Targeting of the Nasal Mucosa by Japanese Encephalitis Virus for Non-Vector-Borne Transmission

The mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) causes severe central nervous system diseases and cycles between Culex mosquitoes and different vertebrates. For JEV and some other flaviviruses, oronasal transmission is described, but the mode of infection is unknown. Using nasal mucosal tissue explants and primary porcine nasal epithelial cells (NEC) at the air-liquid interface (ALI) and macrophages as ex vivo and in vitro models, we determined that the nasal epithelium could represent the route of entry and exit for JEV in pigs. Porcine NEC at the ALI exposed to with JEV resulted in apical and basolateral virus shedding and release of monocyte recruiting chemokines, indicating infection and replication in macrophages. Moreover, macrophages stimulated by alarmins, including interleukin-25, interleukin-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin, were more permissive to the JEV infection. Altogether, our data are important to understand the mechanism of nonvector-borne direct transmission of Japanese encephalitis virus in pigs. IMPORTANCE JEV, a main cause of severe viral encephalitis in humans, has a complex ecology composed of a mosquito-waterbird cycle and a cycle involving pigs, which amplifies virus transmission to mosquitoes, leading to increased human cases. JEV can be transmitted between pigs by contact in the absence of arthropod vectors. Moreover, virus or viral RNA is found in oronasal secretions and the nasal epithelium. Using nasal mucosa tissue explants and three-dimensional porcine nasal epithelial cells cultures and macrophages as ex vivo and in vitro models, we determined that the nasal epithelium could be a route of entry as well as exit for the virus. Infection of nasal epithelial cells resulted in apical and basolateral virus shedding and release of monocyte recruiting chemokines and therefore infection and replication in macrophages, which is favored by epithelial-cell-derived cytokines. The results are relevant to understand the mechanism of non-vector-borne direct transmission of JEV.

Pigs are highly susceptible to JEV infection and rapidly develop viremia, which can last for a few days, during which they can transmit the virus to mosquitoes (4, 6) . Infected pigs normally present mild neurological symptoms, but the infection of pregnant sows can cause abortions and stillbirth (7) . Although JEV infection is typically mosquito borne, contact transmission and high susceptibility to oronasal infection have been described (8) . Several in vivo experiments demonstrated that JEV can be excreted oronasally in infected pigs, independently of the route of inoculation, for a period of 5 days, with a maximum level of virus shedding reached after the end of viremia (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . Furthermore, mathematical modeling using data from outbreaks in Cambodian pig farms supported the possibility that direct transmission also occurs under field conditions (13) . These findings represent a warning that JEV could have the potential to continue to circulate in the pig population by direct transmission in temperate regions during cold mosquito-free periods. In fact, a reemergence of JEV in pig farms located in temperate areas after the winter season without the presence of vectors has been reported in Hokkaido Island in northern Japan (14) . It is also important to note that vector-free transmission of mosquito-borne flaviviruses is not restricted to JEV and pigs. Several species, including macaques, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, rats, and squirrel hamsters, are susceptible to oronasal infection with JEV (15) (16) (17) . In addition, nonvector-borne transmission has been described for other flaviviruses (18, 19) . Examples are Zika virus (ZIKV) (20, 21) , West Nile virus (WNV) (22, 23) , St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) (24) , Bagaza virus (BAGV) (25) , Tembusu virus (TMUV) (26) , and Wesselsbron virus (WESSV) (27) .

Considering these observations, the present study addressed the potential role of the nasal epithelium in contact transmission. Our hypothesis was based on the observation that after oronasal JEV challenge of immune pigs, it is possible to detect the challenge virus in oronasal swabs for several days in the absence of detectable viremia indicating local virus replication (9) . While JEV is also found in tonsils (8, 9, 12) , immune animals' tonsils were found to be protected from infection, indicating that this organ is infected only following viremia (9) and would therefore not represent the point of JEV entry. On the other hand, a recent study demonstrated the presence of viral RNA in the nasal epithelium as well as in the olfactory neuroepithelium (11) . We therefore investigated whether the nasal epithelium can be infected from the apical surface and whether this infection would cause both apical and basolateral virus shedding. This would indeed represent a prerequisite for the epithelium of the upper respiratory tract to play a role in direct transmission of JEV. The present work included ex vivo and in vitro experimental models as porcine nasal explants and well-differentiated porcine primary nasal epithelial cells (NEC) cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI). In fact, our data demonstrate that JEV has the ability of infecting apically, resulting in both apical and basolateral virus shedding in swine nasal epithelial cells and indicating that the porcine nasal mucosa could represent a gateway for JEV entry and exit in pigs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that epithelial cells release soluble factors favoring subsequent infections of macrophages known to be present in the lamina propria of the mucosa.

JEV replicates in porcine nasal mucosa explants. As a first step, we challenged porcine nasal mucosa explants from four different pig donors with both JEV genotype 1 strain Laos and genotype 3 strain Nakayama, in comparison to mock control (Fig. 1) . After 48 h postinfection (hpi), JEV envelope (E) protein was detected in epithelial cells ( Fig. 1A and B) , with a more efficient infection found with the Laos strain-challenged tissues. An increase in JEV RNA loads from both strains was also detected in porcine nasal mucosa, indicative of virus replication (Fig. 1C ). JEV Laos RNA showed an increase in expression from 24 hpi on, further increasing at 48 hpi. The Nakayama strain displayed a slower viral RNA increase, with only three out of four positive samples 48 hpi (Fig. 1C) .

JEV efficiently infects primary porcine NEC. To confirm and further investigate the ability of JEV to infect porcine NEC from their apical side, we utilized well-differentiated ALI cultures established from porcine nasal mucosa. These experiments showed that both JEV strains infected cultures from the apical side, resulting in virus replication (Fig.  2) . Again, the Laos strain showed statistically significantly higher levels of viral RNA than the Nakayama strain. Despite that, the two JEV strains tested displayed similar replication profiles, reaching a maximum at 72 hpi ( Fig. 2A) . To test for apical and/or basolateral live virus shedding upon infection, we collected basolateral chamber culture media and performed apical washings of the infected NEC. The results demonstrate that JEV was apically shed after infection with both JEV strains (Fig. 2B) . Interestingly, similar JEV titers were detected in the culture media collected from the basolateral and apical sides of the inserts (Fig. 2C) , supporting the idea that infection of epithelial cells could result in a systemic infection. With respect to RNA levels, the maximum titers were reached at 72 hpi in both compartments of the ALI system. At 72 hpi, as shown in Fig. 2D , we visualized JEV infection of NEC by labeling of virus (E protein, green), nuclei (4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride [DAPI], dark blue), tight junctions (ZO-1, light blue), and cilia (␤-tubulin, red). While we observed mainly isolated E protein-positive cells for the Nakayama strain, the Laos strain led to the formation of clusters of E protein-positive cells (Fig. 2D) and colocalization of E protein and ␤-tubulin signals, suggesting replication in ciliated epithelial cells (Fig. 2E) . Porcine nasal mucosa explants were challenged with JEV Laos or Nakayama at 10 5 TCID 50 /sample for 2 h, followed by wash steps and culture in medium for 48 h. In panel A, nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue), cilia with anti-␤-tubulin (red), and JEV with anti-E protein 4G2 (green). The scale bar represents 10 m. Three-dimensional (3D) scans were acquired using confocal microscopy. In panel B, a higher magnification of panel A is shown. In panel C, viral RNA was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. Results were calculated as fold change of the threshold cycle and are represented as 25 to 75% interquartile boxes showing the mean and 95% confidence intervals. Different superscript letters indicate significant difference (P Յ 0.05) between samples challenged with the same JEV strain (letters without or with apostrophe for JEV Laos and Nakayama strain, respectively); significant differences between distinct JEV strains at the same time postinfection are shown by an asterisk.

JEV infection of NEC is associated with limited cell death. In NEC cultures, JEV induced limited cell death, visualized as increased membrane permeability (dark blue in Fig. 3A ). This cell death was at least partially mediated by apoptosis since cleaved caspase 3 was detected in the infected cultures (red in Fig. 3B ). Relating to the higher rate of infection, the Laos strain induced more cell death than the Nakayama strain.

JEV induces poor innate immune responses in NEC. Following infection of airway epithelial cells by respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus type 1, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, several proinflammatory cytokines are induced, including interleukin-1␤ (IL-1␤), IL-6, IL-8, and interferon lambda 1 to 3 (IFN-s) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) . We therefore assessed the innate immune response following JEV infection of NEC. Only JEV Laos induced significant IL-6 gene expression at a late time point (72 hpi [Fig. 4A] ). Both JEV strains induced a significant induction of IL-8 mRNA at 48 and 72 hpi (Fig. 4B) . Nevertheless, at the protein levels no virus-induced IL-1␤, IL-6, or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was detected at any of the time points tested (data not shown). Interestingly, IL-8 secretion was enhanced at 72 hpi (P Յ 0.001) in JEV Laos-infected NEC (2,055 Ϯ 595 pg/ml) compared with those in the mock control (1,201 Ϯ 595 pg/ml) and JEV Nakayama (1,151 Ϯ 595 pg/ml) challenges (values are means Ϯ standard deviations [SD]) (Fig. 5) .

Although IFN-3 mRNA was upregulated in a few samples, neither of the JEV strains induced a statistically significant increase in expression for this gene at the investigated time points, suggesting an impact of JEV infection on the IFN pathway response (Fig.  4C ). It has been described that suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), a negative regulator of IFN responses, is upregulated in cells infected by JEV (36) . Interestingly, 48 to 72 hpi both JEV strains induced a significant upregulation of SOCS1 in NEC, with higher gene expression in Laos-infected cells (Fig. 4D) .

JEV infection of NEC induces chemokines mediating monocyte recruitment. Considering that the establishment of innate immune responses by virus-infected cells may also involve the production of chemokines responsible for the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection, we measured the gene expression of several chemokines in JEV-infected porcine NEC (Fig. 6 ). mRNA expression levels of CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL10 were significantly upregulated by the virus at 48 and 72 hpi compared to those in mock controls ( Fig. 6A to C). Nevertheless, for CCL2, only JEV Laos induced a significant mRNA upregulation at 48 hpi (Fig. 6A) .

CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL10 have been described as important chemokines for monocyte recruitment (37) (38) (39) . Consequently, we determined the monocyte chemoattractant . The experiment was repeated three times in duplicate. Data are shown as 25% to 75% interquartile boxes with means and 95% confidence intervals. Different superscript letters indicate significant difference (P Ͻ 0.05) between samples challenged with the same JEV strain (letters without and with apostrophe for JEV Laos and JEV Nakayama, respectively); differences between distinct JEV strains and the mock control at the same time postinfection are shown by asterisks (*, P Յ 0.05; **, P Յ 0.002; ***, P Յ 0.001).

activity of basolateral medium collected from JEV-infected NEC at 72 hpi (Fig. 6D ). We observed that medium from Laos strain-infected NEC induced a significant increase of porcine monocyte migration (Fig. 6D ). supernatants were collected and IL-8 levels were determined by ELISA. The experiment was repeated three times in duplicate. Data are shown as 25% to 75% interquartile boxes with means and 95% confidence intervals. Different superscript letters indicate significant difference (P Ͻ 0.05) between samples challenged with the same JEV strain (letters without and with apostrophe for JEV Laos and JEV Nakayama, respectively); differences between distinct JEV strains and the mock control at the same time postinfection are shown by asterisks (*, P Յ 0.05; **, P Յ 0.002; ***, P Յ 0.001).

FIG 6 JEV-infected porcine NEC express chemokines and induce monocyte chemotaxis. RNA was extracted from NEC and gene expression of chemokines was determined by RT-qPCR for CCL2 (A), CCL5 (B), and CXCL10 (C). Data are shown as 25% to 75% interquartile boxes with means and Ϯ95% confidence intervals. Basolateral medium from porcine NEC at 72 hpi was used for chemotaxis experiments. (D) Mean values Ϯ SD are shown, with different superscript letters indicating significant difference (P Յ 0.05) between samples challenged with the same JEV strain (letters without and with apostrophe for JEV Laos and JEV Nakayama, respectively); differences between distinct JEV strains and mock at the same time postinfection are shown by asterisks (*, P Յ 0.05; **, P Յ 0.002; ***, P Յ 0.001). that such cultures released monocyte chemoattractant factors, we next investigated infection of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) to mimic the possible subsequent in vivo cellular target following infection of NEC. Importantly, resting mucosal tissue resident macrophages have been described to have an "M2-like" functional status resembling that of IL-4-polarized macrophages (40, 41) . We therefore tested the infectivity of JEV released from NEC cultures for both nonpolarized and IL-4-polarized macrophages. To also assess potential additional factors released from the infected NEC cultures, we compared the infectivity of basolateral culture media obtained from infected NEC and JEV derived from Vero cell-propagated virus. Of note, the media used as infectious JEV sources were adjusted to the same multiplicity of infection (MOI).

The first observation made in these experiments was that IL-4 treatment of macrophages enhanced infectivity and virus replication of both strains of JEV ( Fig. 7A and Fig.  8 ). The second observation was that JEV harvested from NEC had enhanced infectivity for IL-4-treated macrophages (Fig. 7A ) and resulted in higher levels of replication in all macrophage cultures than obtained with virus grown in Vero cells (Fig. 7B) . This indicated the presence of additional factors released by epithelial cells with a potential to enhance infection of macrophages.

Epithelial cells from the respiratory tract release innate cytokines in response to a viral infection, also known as "alarmins," which include IL-33, IL-25, and thymic stromal lyphoprotein (TSLP); these cytokines activate immune cells like T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages, normally driving a Th2 immune response (42) (43) (44) (45) . We therefore investigated the impact of these alarmins which could be potentially released by JEV-infected epithelial cells. To this end, we tested the effects of human recombinant IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP on macrophage infectivity by JEV. These experiments showed Data are shown as 25% to 75% interquartile boxes with means and 95% confidence intervals. Different superscript letters indicate significant difference (P Ͻ 0.05) between samples challenged with the same JEV strain (letters without and with apostrophe for JEV Laos and JEV Nakayama, respectively); differences between distinct JEV strains and the mock control at the same time postinfection are shown by asterisks (*, P Յ 0.05; **, P Յ 0.002).

that the presence of the alarmins during the viral infection phase can lead to a higher percentage of infected cells (Fig. 8A) . In nonpolarized macrophages, this enhancement of infection by JEV was statistically significant for IL-33 alone, for IL-33 combined with TSLP, and for IL-33 combined with TSLP and IL-25 (Fig. 9A) . In IL-4-polarized macrophages, a further enhancement of infection was statistically significant for IL-25 alone, TSLP alone, and every combination of IL-33 with the other alarmins (Fig. 9B ). 

As mentioned in the introduction, there is increasing evidence for vector-free transmission of flaviviruses, in which oronasal, contact, or aerosol exposure to the virus has resulted in infection of various vertebrates. The reported flaviviruses, all described as mosquito borne, include at least JEV, WNV, SLEV, yellow fever virus, ZIKV, Spondweni virus, WESSV, TMUV, and dengue virus (DENV), and the species concerned include pigs, humans, nonhuman primates, mice, guinea pigs, hamsters, geese, partridges, ducks, several other species of birds, and even alligators (8, 9, 12, 15-17, 20-22, 24-27, 46-54) . Some of these reports are from experimental studies, and others are from field observations, laboratory infections, or infections of exposed health care providers or animal caretakers. Despite this multitude of reports, nothing is known about the mechanisms leading to such routes of transmission. For nonlaboratory exposures, a first prerequisite for aerosol contact transmission would be that the virus is secreted into body fluids such as mucosal secretions or urine. In fact, this has been described in many of the references previously cited, but the source of virus and first target remained unknown.

Considering the above, the present study addressed JEV infection of the porcine airway mucosal epithelium, which represents an important first physical barrier for the entrance of pathogens into hosts. In addition, epithelial cells also contribute to innate antiviral responses through the production of cytokines, chemokines, and IFNs (55) (56) (57) . To also address mucociliary activities, we used well-differentiated primary NEC cultures and demonstrated that JEV infects epithelial cells from nasal mucosal explants as well as NEC cultures (summarized in Fig. 10 ). Despite the fact that respiratory viruses are normally shed only apically and rarely basolaterally, JEV is shed to both the apical and basolateral sides of the epithelial cells and such an infection could thus mediate virus entry into the host as well as oronasal virus spread to other hosts in a manner principally comparable to that of respiratory viruses such as influenza virus. Our in vitro results complements previously published in vivo findings, which can explain the high efficiency of JEV infection of pigs via the oronasal route and are in line with different experiments which showed oronasal shedding several days beyond the end of viremia, and they additionally can explain the detection of high levels of JEV RNA in nasal mucosa, which can last up to 10 days after challenge (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . The in vivo relevance of the presented data is further supported by the observation that after oronasal JEV challenge of immune pigs, it is possible to detect the challenge virus in oronasal swabs for several days in the absence of detectable viremia (9), pointing to a local cellular source for virus replication, which is also supported by a recent study in which the larger JEV RNA amount was detected in nasal mucosa (11) .

We also investigated innate immune responses induced by JEV infection of porcine NEC, and our data indicate a mild and delayed induction of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 and undetectable levels of other cytokines, such as IL-1␤ and TNF, contrasting with the inflammatory cytokine responses induced by common respiratory viruses (58) (59) (60) . As for IFN-s, which are important mucosal antiviral factors produced by respiratory epithelial cells, we did not detect a significant increase at the transcriptional level, confirming the relatively silent infection of the nasal epithelium, which could enable JEV to bypass the first line of immune defenses of the upper respiratory tract. This idea is also supported by the weak cytopathic effect of JEV on NEC and by the observed induction of SOCS1, a potent negative regulator of the IFN pathway and consequently also of the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (61) . This is in accordance with a report describing SOCS1 induction during JEV infection (36) .

As part of the innate immune response against virus infections targeting the respiratory tract, such as influenza virus or RSV infection (28, 30, 32) , JEV infection of porcine NEC also induced several chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL10), which would direct the migration of monocytes to the site of infection. This led us to investigate the potential next step for the establishment of a systemic infection, which could be the infection of myeloid cells present in the submucosal area. In fact, MDM were found to be susceptible to infection and supported a high level of virus replication which was further enhanced by IL-4 polarization. This is relevant, as such a polarization could also be induced following JEV infection of NEC through the release of alarmins, such as IL-33, IL-25, and TSLP, from stressed and dying epithelial cells (42) (43) (44) (45) . These alarmins are known to stimulate immune cells present in the nasal mucosa to produce IL-4 and IL-13, which promote M2-like macrophage polarization (62) (63) (64) (65) . In fact, our data indicate that supernatants from infected porcine NEC cultures contained factors which further enhanced infection of macrophages. We also demonstrated that these alarmins can enhance JEV infection of macrophages, further supporting this concept.

For these experiments, we used two different strains of JEV, the Nakayama strain, originally isolated in 1935 (66) , and the more recent Laos strain (67) . Our results demonstrate a higher infectivity and level of replication for the Laos strain in both porcine NEC and macrophages. Associated with this was also a higher level of induced innate immune responses in epithelial cells. The reason for these strain-related differences is unknown, and strain and genotype effects require further investigations.

The used in vitro NEC model has the advantage of representing fully differentiated ALI cultures containing mucus-producing goblet cells and functional cilia, which both represent first physical barriers of infection. In contrast to in vivo work, such cultures permit controlled kinetics studies of virus infection and basolateral and apical shedding, which is not possible in vivo. The same applies to the macrophage work in terms of virus replication and shedding and analyzing the impact of epithelial-cell-derived immunomodulatory factors. Such models may be used for any species and therefore permit analysis of species differences.

In conclusion, the present study indicates that the epithelium of the upper respiratory tract may represent the port of entry and exit for direct transmission of JEV between pigs, complementing previous in vivo work. We also show how this infection may lead to subsequent infection of myeloid cells known to be present in the submucosa. Our data are of relevance to understanding the mechanism of direct transmission for JEV and potentially other flaviviruses. Although the present work does not provide final proof that the respiratory epithelium represents the port of entry and exit during direct transmission events of JEV, our results represent an important basis for further in vivo investigations to confirm the cellular tropism of JEV and the kinetics of events during infection of pigs via the respiratory tract.

Viruses. For the present work, we employed the same JEV strains as in our previously published in vivo studies (8, 9, 12) : JEV Laos, belonging to genotype 1 (CNS769_Laos_2009; GenBank accession number KC196115.1 [67] ; kindly provided by R. Charrel, Aix-Marseille Université, France), and JEV Nakayama, genotype 3 (National Collection of Pathogenic Viruses, Salisbury, UK). JEV was propagated in Vero cells (ATCC CCL81) in G-MEM BHK-21 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Biowest, Nuaillé, France) and cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Viral titers were determined in Vero cells using the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) with the anti-flavivirus E antibody 4G2 (ATCC HB-112). Titers were calculated and expressed as 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) per milliliter.

JEV infection of porcine nasal mucosa explants. Nasal mucosa explants were isolated from four 3-month-old pigs at a local slaughterhouse. The nasal cavity was opened in the longitudinal axes, and nasal mucosa was removed in strips (3 by 8 cm). After the tissues were rinsed with minimum essential medium (MEM; Thermo Fisher) supplemented with antibiotics (100 U/ml of penicillin, 100 g/ml of streptomycin, 0.25 g/ml of amphotericin B, and 50 g/ml of gentamicin; Sigma-Aldrich), they were placed onto sterile surgical compresses sodden with fresh MEM and kept on ice. Surgical compresses were cut in squares of 1.2 cm, placed in 12-well plates, and filled until the top of the compress surface with bronchial epithelial growth medium (BEGM [68] ), supplemented with antibiotics (see above). Next, the nasal mucosa tissues were cut in 1-cm squares and placed onto the compresses in 12-well plates and refilled with medium, keeping the apical side of the tissue at the ALI. After incubation overnight at 37°C in 5% CO 2 , mucus was washed away with BEGM, and mucosa pieces were transferred to new empty 12-well plates without compresses. There tissues were challenged with JEV at 10 5 TCID 50 s/ml in 400 l, incubated for 1.5 h at 37°C, and washed 3 times with BEGM. In order to establish again the ALI conditions, mucosa was transferred onto new freshly prepared 12-well plates with compresses and fresh BEGM with antibiotics. After 2, 24, and 48 hpi one piece of tissue per condition and animal was processed for RNA extraction. At 72 hpi, additional tissues were embedded and cryopreserved in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT; Leica Microsystems). Using a cryostat, nasal mucosa sections at a thickness of 4 m were cut and then fixed with acetone-methanol (1:1).

Generation of porcine NEC. NEC were generated as previously described (68), with improvements. Briefly, nasal epithelial tissues were harvested from pigs at a local slaughterhouse, and tissues were transported on ice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) lacking Na 2

Ϫ and Ca 2 Ϫ (PBS Ϫ/Ϫ ; supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin; Sigma). After washing and removal of fat and connective tissue, the epithelium was treated with 0.1% protease (mass/volume [m/v]; from Streptomyces griseus type XIV; Sigma) and desoxyribonuclease I (0.001% m/v; from bovine pancreas; Sigma) for release of epithelial cells. After 48 h the cells were harvested by gently scratching the apical surface and washed twice with PBS Ϫ/Ϫ . Between the washing steps, the cells were passed through a 100-m cell strainer (Becton, Dickinson). Then 2 ϫ 10 6 cells were seeded in T75 tissue culture flasks coated with collagen types I and III (VitroCol; Sigma), in 25 ml of bronchial epithelial cell serum-free growth medium (BEGM; LHC basal medium supplemented; Thermo Fisher) supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF, 25 ng/ml; Thermo Fisher) and retinoic acid (50 nM; Sigma) and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . The medium was changed after 24 h and then every 2 to 3 days until confluence was reached. Cells were detached using trypsin (Sigma) and frozen in liquid nitrogen with 40% FBS and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing Glutamax and without phenol red (DMEM; Gibco, Thermo Fisher) at 2.5 ϫ 10 6 cells per tube. For ALI cultures, 12-well inserts with a pore size of 0.4 m (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were coated with collagen type IV (Sigma), and 2 ϫ 10 5 cells per insert were seeded in 500 l of BEGM (EGF, 25 ng/ml; Thermo Fisher) and 1 ml in the lower chamber, and cells were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . After 24 h, the insert medium was replaced, and then the medium in both chambers was changed every 2 to 3 days. After reaching confluence, the cells were shifted to ALI by removing the medium in the upper chamber, and in the basal chamber BEGM was replaced with ALI medium (1:1 [vol/vol] LHC basal medium plus DMEM, supplemented as BEGM with 1 ng/ml of EGF; Thermo Fisher). Experiments were performed as soon as movement of cilia was visible, indicating full differentiation of cultures.

Flavivirus infection of porcine NEC. NEC were apically challenged with an MOI of 0.1 TCID 50 /cell for 1.5 h at 37°C. Then the virus inoculum was discarded, the NEC apical surface washed three times with prewarmed PBS Ϫ/Ϫ , and the inserts were transferred into new plates with fresh ALI medium in the basolateral chamber for culture at 37°C and 5% CO 2. Mock infection controls were included. After 24, 48, and 72 hpi, apical washes and basolateral medium were collected and stored at Ϫ70°C for later titrations. RNA was extracted from NEC at each indicated time postinfection. An extra insert was kept for 72 hpi to fix in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for immunolabeling.

RNA extraction and RT-qPCR. RNA was extracted using NucleoSpin RNA II filtered columns (Macherey-Nagel). cDNA was generated with the Omniscript reverse transcription (RT) kit (Qiagen) using random hexamers (Thermo Fisher). RT-quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using TaqMan Fast Universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). The primer and probe sequences used in this work are listed in Table 1 . Fold change of gene expression was calculated using the threshold cycle (2 ϪΔΔCT ) method (69) , and the 18S housekeeping gene was used for normalization. Relative gene expression results are presented on a base 2 logarithmic scale.

Cytokine measurements. Basolateral supernatants of NEC harvested at 24, 48, and 72 hpi were used for determination of porcine IL-1␤, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK).

Porcine macrophages preparation and infection. MDM were generated from monocytes as previously described (70) . To this end, blood from 6-to 24-month-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) Swiss Large White pigs from our own breeding facilities was taken, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using density centrifugation (1.077 g/liter; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Then monocytes were isolated by magnetic cell sorting with an LS column (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) as CD172a ϩ cells using monoclonal antibody (MAb) clone 74-22-15 (ATCC). Sorted monocytes were seeded at 5 ϫ 10 5 /ml in DMEM-10% FBS and porcine macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF; 20 U/ml, produced in-house [70, 71] ) and cultured for 3 days at 39°C and 5% CO 2 . After MDM differentiation, medium was replaced with fresh MDM (for nonpolarized MDM) or with medium supplemented with IL-4 (100 U/ml, produced in-house; for IL-4-polarized MDM) (72, 73) and incubated for another 24 h.

To investigate the ability of JEV released to the basolateral side of porcine NEC to infect MDM, the cells were incubated with 200 l of the basolateral medium collected at 72 hpi from JEV-infected NEC. As controls, MDM were challenged with JEV from our virus stocks at an MOI adapted to that of the basolateral NEC medium. To determine if epithelial alarmins influence JEV infection (Laos; MOI, 1 TCID 50 /cell) of MDM, recombinant human IL-25, IL-33, TSLP (Thermo Fisher), or any possible combination thereof was added at 10 ng/ml each, with the virus inoculum and removed at the same time after incubation. For MDM infection, the cells were incubated 1.5 h at 37°C and 5% CO 2 with the virus, washed three times with PBS Ϫ/Ϫ , and incubated at 39°C and 5% CO 2 for 24 h in fresh DMEM-2% FBS. The MDM were harvested as cell suspensions, immunolabeled with the anti-flavivirus group antigen antibody 4G2, and acquired on a FACSCantoII (Becton, Dickinson). Dead cells were excluded by electronic gating in forward/side scatter plots, followed by exclusion of doublets using Flowjo V.9.1 software (Treestar, Ashland, OR).

First, 600 l per well of basolateral supernatants from JEV-infected porcine NEC were harvested at 72 hpi and dispensed into 24-well plates. Next, 10 6 monocytes were added into Transwell inserts with 3-m-diameter pores (Becton, Dickinson) and placed in the wells filled with the porcine NEC culture-derived basolateral medium. After 3 h of incubation at 39°C and 5% CO 2 , basolateral medium was harvested and total monocytes were harvested and quantified. Monocyte phenotype was verified by immunolabeling with anti-porcine CD14 (MIL2; Bio-Rad). Controls included ALI medium, medium collected from mock-treated porcine NEC, and porcine CCL2 (200 pg/ml in ALI medium; Kingfisher Biotech, St. Paul, MN). For monocyte quantification by flow cytometry, CountBright absolute counting beads (Thermo Fisher) were used following the manufacturer's manual. Dead cells were excluded by electronic gating in forward/side scatter plots, followed by exclusion of doublets.

Confocal microscopy imaging. Porcine nasal mucosa tissue slices 4 m thick were washed in confocal buffer (CB; 50 nM ammonium chloride and 0.1% saponin in PBS Ϫ/Ϫ ) for 30 min and then incubated with anti-flavivirus group antigen antibody 4G2 for 2 h. After 3 washes with CB, the tissue was incubated for 1 h with Alexa Fluor 488-coupled anti-IgG2a (Thermo Fisher), and Cy3-conjugated anti-␤tubulin (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was used for the detection of cilia. Porcine NEC cultured on the Transwell membranes were washed with PBS Ϫ/Ϫ and incubated in 4% PFA for 15 min. In the second step, the membranes were incubated in CB for 30 min. Cells were incubated with anti-ZO-1 (Thermo Fisher) and anti-flavivirus group antigen antibody 4G2 for 2 h, followed by Alexa Fluor 633-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Thermo Fisher), Alexa Fluor 488-coupled anti-IgG2a (Thermo Fisher), and Cy3-conjugated anti-␤-tubulin (Abcam). For evaluation of cell death in porcine NEC, Abcam's Fixable Cell Viability Assay Kit (Fluorometric-Blue)-CytoPainter was applied for 30 min, and then cells were washed with PBS Ϫ/Ϫ and fixed with 4% PFA, followed by an incubation with anti-flavivirus group antigen antibody 4G2 as described before and labeling with phalloidin conjugated with AF555 (Thermo Fisher) and Alexa Fluor 488-coupled anti-IgG2a (Thermo Fisher) for 1 h. As a positive control for cleaved caspase 3 (C-Cas3) staining, apoptosis in porcine NEC was induced by incubation with anti-human CD90 (5E10; Becton, Dickinson). For detection of apoptotic cells, inserts were fixed with 4% PFA and incubated in CB for 30 min, incubated with anti-C-Cas3 (Cell Signaling Technologies), anti-flavivirus E protein antibody 4G2 for 2 h, washed, and labeled with phalloidin conjugated with AF647, Alexa Fluor 633-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG, and Alexa Fluor 488-coupled anti-IgG2a (Thermo Fisher) for 1 h. All incubations were performed at room temperature in the dark. For each staining, 4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, Sigma) at 2 g/ml was applied for 5 min at 37°C and washed off with PBS Ϫ/Ϫ . Then tissue slices of porcine NEC were mounted on glass slides in Mowiol 4-88 reagent (Sigma). For confocal microscopy analysis, a confocal microscope A1 (Nikon AG) combined with an ECLIPSE Ti inverted microscope (Nikon) and digital imaging Nikon software (AR 3.30.02) were used. The image acquisitions were performed with the 40ϫ objective, sequential channel acquisition and not simultaneous was employed; in order to give high-resolution images, the acquiring setting was performed with optimized voxel size and automatic threshold. The images were analyzed with Imaris 8.0.2 software (Bitplane AG, Zurich, Switzerland). To avoid false-positive emissions, different settings were applied, including background subtraction, threshold applications, gamma correction, and maxima. Insert surface staining (for E protein, CytoPainter, and C-Cas3) was calculated as average of positive signal of each channel from 20 different nonoverlapping fields in triplicate porcine NECs using confocal microscopy.

Statistics. Figures and data collection analysis were done using GraphPad Prism 7 software (Graph-Pad Software, San Diego, CA). For viral titrations, differences between groups were assessed by Kruskal-Wallis analysis, and for individual differences the Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction as post hoc was employed. For the rest of the comparisons, such as differences between groups in the percentage of infected cells or gene expression levels, we employed a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A P value lower than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Detection of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) using isothermal amplification of target DNA sequences

The most common method of GMO detection is based upon the amplification of GMO-specific DNA amplicons using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Here we have applied the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method to amplify GMO-related DNA sequences, 'internal' commonly-used motifs for controlling transgene expression and event-specific (plant-transgene) junctions.

We have tested the specificity and sensitivity of the technique for use in GMO studies. Results show that detection of 0.01% GMO in equivalent background DNA was possible and dilutions of template suggest that detection from single copies of the template may be possible using LAMP.

Conclusion: This work shows that GMO detection can be carried out using LAMP for routine screening as well as for specific events detection. Moreover, the sensitivity and ability to amplify targets, even with a high background of DNA, here demonstrated, highlights the advantages of this isothermal amplification when applied for GMO detection.

The ability to detect the presence of GMO is pivotal for consumers to be able to exercise their lifestyle choice of whether to consume, or not, food containing GMOs. Though the detection and quantification of GMO proteins using immunoassay has been reported [1] , denaturation of the protein during processing makes the method unsuitable for GMO testing and quantification of food. The durability of DNA makes it a better substrate for testing and its amplification by PCR is the method of choice, as recommended by the EC (2004/787), for detection and quantification of GMO in samples.

An alternative DNA amplification method was described by Notomi and coworkers [2] called 'loop mediated isothermal amplification' (LAMP). The LAMP assay relies on the design of a set of primers that generate stem looped (hairpin) structures during the early stage of DNA synthesis. The hairpin structures form because two of the primers used contain, at their 5' end, a reverse complement of a sequence that is present in the target further downstream of the initial binding site. Displacement primers help the formation of these hairpins at the ends of the DNA strands and once formed, these structures can be copied into a series of DNA fragments containing multiple units of the target sequence under isothermal conditions utilizing the displacement properties of Bst polymerase (see [3] ). Although LAMP was first described using a set of four primers, enhanced sensitivity was reported using an additional pair of loop primers [4] . As the reactions are performed at a single temperature, LAMP assays can be performed very quickly since there are no separate denaturation, annealing and extension steps, and as such, reactions do not require thermalcyclers. Here we assess the LAMP protocol for the detection of GMOs using primers that target event-specific sequences for transgenic MS8 and RF3 oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) and generic GMO sequences such as the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (P-35S) and the promoter and terminator for the nopaline synthase gene (P-nos and T-nos, respectively) from Agrobacterium spp.

The LAMP technique relies on the design of an interrelated set of primers. The orientation and positions are important for self-priming through stem-looped products that drive and perpetuate the reaction.

The OSR events MS8 and RF3 arise from the insertion of two closely related transgenes from the plasmids, pTHW107 and pTHW118, respectively [5] . The former encodes the Barnase gene that give rise to male sterility, which is replaced in the latter by the Barstar gene which restores fertility: both also have the selectable marker bar which confers tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate ammonium. Though the left border of the RF3 insert has undergone rearrangement in the form of duplication and inversion [5] , the right borders of both events are relatively intact (our data [6] which agree with the two sequences in the database).

Even though the insertions of the transgenes have different breakpoints from the plasmids, they are very close so it was possible to design assays for the RF3 and MS8 events utilizing a common set of primers within the transgenes ( Figure 1 ). When used in conjunction with primers for the plant sequence at the border of each event, they are able to detect each event ( Figure 2 ). Since they have 50% of primers in common, it was important to determine whether there was any cross reaction between the assays. Specificity of the two assays was tested using plasmid DNA for each event. No cross-reaction between the two targets was observed ( Figure 2 ).

The sensitivity of the LAMP reaction was assessed in two ways: copy number detection and background in which 10 copies of the target could be detected. Copy number detection was measured by serial dilutions of known amounts of DNA containing the target sequences, either as genomic or plasmid DNA ( Figure 3 ). Reactions fail in both assays at DNA molecule number of less than 1 which is consistent with the stochastic probability of a target being present [7] .

We note that sometimes non-specific amplification can also take place, especially where the target DNA is absent (see Figure 3 ) and there is low amounts of DNA present in the reaction (cf Figures 3a and 4) . These do not form the specific banding patterns representing the different multimeric LAMP products that are characteristic for each assay and thus can be easily distinguished on a gel. Alternative banding patterns have been observed, also for low template reactions; analyses of these products show that they are formed by interactions of the primers used [8] , to form LAMP equivalents of primer-dimers. Two factors seem to be important: in the absence of target, low background DNA may aid the formation of non-specific products that go on to be amplified; and freeze-thaw repetitions may induce damage to the primers to permit the formation of 'primer intermediates' which can then be amplified. Since LAMP is capable of non-specific amplification, techniques that rely on the detection of by-products of DNA synthesis, e.g., the use of magnesium pyrophosphate precipitation [9] or the use of SyBr Green dye [10] may not be able to distinguish between real and Right border sequences of MS8 and RF3 Figure 1 Right border sequences of MS8 and RF3. Sequences of the plant (above) and transgene (below) at the right border junctions for MS8 and RF3. Highlighted sequences are the targets of the LAMP primers. The plant sequences are those shown in Table 1 : dark blue bases highlighted are the outer displacement primers, yellow and green sequences are the 5' and 3' ends of the LAMP primers respectively, and light blue sequences depict the loop primers. The sensitivity of the LAMP assay and its suitability for practical GMO detection was tested using assays for commonly-used sequence motifs, the CaMV 35S promoter (P-35S) and the Agrobacterium promoter and terminator for the nopaline synthase gene (P-nos and T-nos, respectively). These sequences are commonly used in constructs used to create approved GM events (see [11] ). RoundUp Ready™ soya construct contains both P-35S and T-nos so provided convenient template for testing the assays. We used a sample where the copy number of the GM has been well characterized and thus control the number of template in each reaction.

LAMP sensitivity was assessed by the detection of ten RoundUp Ready™ GMO targets in a background of 100 ng of genomic oilseed rape DNA (Figure 3 ). Since the C value of both species is approximately 1 pg [12] , this background DNA represents a GMO level of 0.01% for both Tnos and P-35S assays. OSR DNA was used because we did not have any soya DNA free from RoundUp Ready™. DNA extracted from our 0% CRM was shown to contain 0.002% GMO [13] . The use of 100 ng of this sample would be equivalent to adding 200 copies of the transgene sequence, considerably more than the experimental input of 10 copies. We believe the use of OSR DNA to be a valid substitute since none of the primer sequences for either assay will be present in non-transgenic soya or oilseed rape.

We have tested the upper limits of DNA that LAMP reactions can tolerate and found that up to 200 ng DNA in a 20 μl reaction, positive detection is reproducible. Above this DNA level, reactions become unreliable (data not shown).

We have found that denaturation of template was a prerequisite step prior to amplification, unlike results found by Nagamine and co-workers [14] . This can be explained by the fact that we do not use a base pair destabiliser, such as betaine, in the reaction buffer. Since we are detecting down to near single copies of templates, our results suggest no benefit to the sensitivity of the assay by their inclusion. The consistent amplification within all dilutions showed that LAMP is an 'all or nothing' reaction, with little of the tailing off effect that is often observed in PCRs with diluting templates. This makes it easy to identify positive reactions. Together with specificity and the speed at which reactions can be performed, LAMP is an excellent method for diagnostics [8, 10, 15] .

The use of CaMV 35S promoter sequence in LAMP has previously been reported as a screening method [16] .

Here we demonstrate the sensitivity and reliability of the LAMP method for GMO detection, both with generic and GMO-specific assays. The ability to perform reactions in a simple heated block or water bath without the need for thermal cycling makes testing using LAMP more accessible.

That LAMP is able to detect very small amounts of target and do that even in high amounts of background DNA makes it ideal for GMO detection. GMO testing can be performed in steps: routine screening for the presence of GMOs using generic assays such as for 35S promoters and T-nos; and if required, identification of specific events can be performed using event-specific assays. Equally, direct screening using event-specific assays is also feasible. The levels of sensitivity are orders of magnitude below the permissible threshold for GMO in food and feed (EC regulation 1830/2003), ensuring the detection of the presence of GMOs at acceptable levels and the reliable detection of any presence of unauthorised GM events, for which at present there is no legally acceptable lower limit (according to EC regulations).

Conventional oilseed rape (OSR) seed, variety 'Hearty' was a gift from Christine Lewis, NIAB. The sample was originally purchased from Monsanto UK Ltd (Cambridge, UK). DNA was extracted by grinding 2 g seed with 10 ml extraction buffer [0.5 M NaCl, 0.1 M EDTA pH 8 and 1% (w/v) SDS] in a mortar with a pestle. The sample was emulsified with 5 ml of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) and poured into a 20 ml Falcon polypropylene tube. After centrifugation at 1000 g for 5 mins, the aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube and nucleic acids DNA from the oilseed rape MS8/RF3 was extracted from seedlings from a selfed MS8/RF3 plant [17] using DNeasy Plant DNA Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Crawley, UK). The parent plant was genotyped to be MS8MS8/RF3rf3 using real-time PCR (data not shown). The sample was quantified using picogreen fluorescence (Molecular Probes Inc., Invitrogen). DNA containing RoundUp Ready™ soya was extracted from Soya Roundup Ready™ GMO Reference Material (Fluka Biochemika, Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK) and the GMO concentration of the sample has been accurately determined by dilutions of template combined with statistical analysis [13] .

The plasmid pGreenII 0049 was a gift from Mark Smedley and Wendy Harwood of the John Innes Centre. Details of the plasmid can be found at the website: http:// www.pgreen.ac.uk/JIT/pGreen0000_fr.htm Sensitivity assessment of LAMP Detection Figure 3 Sensitivity assessment of LAMP Detection. A. Sensitivity of LAMP using genomic target. DNA from MS8/RF3 sample (16 ng.μL -1 ) was serially diluted and amplified by LAMP, in triplicate, using primers to assay for the RF3 junction. The numbers in parenthesis represent the approximate copy numbers of the target assuming that the sample represents RF3 in a hemizygous state (determined using RT-PCR data not shown) for the transgene and using 1 pg as the genome size for oilseed rape. C is the no DNA control and M represents molecular size markers. The smear (*) shows an example of non-specific amplification. B. Sensitivity of LAMP using plasmid target. Serial dilutions of the plasmid pGreenII were amplified using primers for the Pnos target. Numbers represent the calculated copy numbers of the plasmid derived from the DNA value. C is the no DNA control and M represents molecular sized markers.

Plasmids containing each event were constructed to test the specificity of the MS8 and RF3 assays separately. The junction at the right borders of the transgenes were amplified by PCR from the MS8/RF3 DNA sample using the displacement (outer) primers of the LAMP reactions, MS8-RF3 DisplR (B3c) separately with MS8 DisplF (F3) and RF3 DisplF (F3), to amplify the MS8 and RF3 junctions, respectively (see Figure 1 and Table 1 ). The fragments were cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega, Southampton, UK) and transformed into DH5α. Clones containing the correct inserts were confirmed by sequencing.

Target sequences for P-35S, P-nos and T-nos were chosen based upon common identity between different plasmids in the EMBL database containing the promoters and terminator. The sequences of the targets and positions of the primers are provided (see Additional file 1).

Primers for each target segment have Tm's of 50-52°C (calculated using the 2 × AT, 4 × GC formula), except for the F2 and B2 regions (3' of the LAMP primers), where the Tm was 54-56°C. Primer sequences are listed in Table 1 .

For LAMP reactions, primers were purchased from Sigmagenosys (Table 1) . Reactions were performed in 20 μl containing 1 × Bst pol buffer (NEB, Ipswich, UK) with 0.4 mM each dNTP with the appropriate primers listed in Table 1 : Displacement primers were each used at a concentration of 0.2 μM; Loop primers at 0.4 μM and LAMP primers at 0.8 μM in the reactions. Enough reaction reagents, without template and enzyme, were mixed together and split into two. Template (1 μl) was added to 9 μl of the mix and the samples denatured at 95°C for 2 mins and then cooled to 4°C. Bst pol was added to the remaining reaction mix to a concentration of 3.2 U.μl -1 , mixed thoroughly, and 10 μl was added to each reaction. Reactions were incubated at 55°C for 2 hours, followed by 80°C for 10 mins to inactivate the enzyme and stored at 4°C until analysed. Aliquots of the reactions (5 μl) were run on 1.5% (w/v) agarose gels, containing ethidium bromide 

iLIR@viral: A web resource for LIR motif-containing proteins in viruses

Macroautophagy/autophagy has been shown to mediate the selective lysosomal degradation of pathogenic bacteria and viruses (xenophagy), and to contribute to the activation of innate and adaptative immune responses. Autophagy can serve as an antiviral defense mechanism but also as a proviral process during infection. Atg8-family proteins play a central role in the autophagy process due to their ability to interact with components of the autophagy machinery as well as selective autophagy receptors and adaptor proteins. Such interactions are usually mediated through LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs. So far, only one viral protein has been experimentally shown to have a functional LIR motif, leaving open a vast field for investigation. Here, we have developed the iLIR@viral database (http://ilir.uk/virus/) as a freely accessible web resource listing all the putative canonical LIR motifs identified in viral proteins. Additionally, we used a curated text-mining analysis of the literature to identify novel putative LIR motif-containing proteins (LIRCPs) in viruses. We anticipate that iLIR@viral will assist with elucidating the full complement of LIRCPs in viruses.

Autophagy is a multistep process that consists of the isolation of cytoplasmic components into double-membrane vesicles, called autophagosomes, that shuttle to lysosomes, which serve as end-point degradative organelles. It is a catabolic mechanism that enables the removal of damaged or excess cellular organelles and proteins, thereby contributing to the maintenance of cell homeostasis and survival. 1 The autophagic machinery is highly conserved from unicellular eukaryotes to metazoans. Among the proteins that take part in this process, the Atg8-family proteins play a central role. 2 Indeed, these proteins are involved in the elongation and maturation of the autophagosome and its fusion with lysosomes. 1, 3 Phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated Atg8-family proteins reside on autophagosomal membranes where they can contribute to the recruitment of other core autophagy machinery proteins essential for the effective course of the autophagy process. 1, [4] [5] [6] [7] Although originally considered to be a nonselective bulk degradation mechanism, a gathering body of evidence over the past decade suggests that autophagy is much more selective than initially appreciated. Selective targeting of cellular components to autophagosomes for degradation relies on the existence of selective autophagy receptors able to recognize and tether cargos toward nascent autophagosomes. 8, 9 Examples of selective autophagy include aggrephagy, mitophagy, lipophagy, and xenophagy. [10] [11] [12] [13] The interaction between selective autophagy receptors and Atg8-family proteins is essential for the proper steering of the cargo for degradation. These receptors typically contain an LC3-interacting region (LIR, also known as LRS, AIM or GIM; the latter correspond to LC3 recognition sequence, Atg8-interacting motif and GABARAP interaction motif respectively) critical for the binding to Atg8-family proteins. 7, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] The LIR motif consists of a short amino acid sequence with a core motif originally described as W/F/YxxI/L/ V (where 'x' represents any amino acids, and referred to as WxxL hereafter). 7, 18 This sequence has lately been relaxed and extended to 6 amino acids to integrate most of the experimentally verified LIRs. [ILV] , where the residues in positions 3 and 6 correspond to the most crucial ones for the interaction with Atg8-family proteins. [26] [27] [28] Besides its role in cellular homeostasis, autophagy is also involved in the innate immune response against pathogens. 13, 29, 30 Recent years have seen an outburst of studies on autophagy and viral infections. Autophagy may exert a variety of antiviral functions, including the degradation of viral components (known as virophagy), the activation of innate immunity by the delivery of viral nucleic acids to the Toll-like receptors, and adaptive immunity through the major histocompatibility complex II (MCH-II/HLA class II), or the control of the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] However, to be successful, viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade host defense. Several viruses have thus developed strategies to use the autophagy machinery or even thrive in the autophagosomes and promote their replication, spread, and survival. [44] [45] [46] [47] Other viruses susceptible to autophagy have evolved mechanisms to counteract autophagy activation by expressing proteins that interfere with the cellular machinery, essentially inhibiting the autophagosome-lysosome fusion or interfering with early stages of autophagy activation. [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] A few proteins from viruses infecting mammals and plants that interfere with the host autophagy process have been shown to associate with Atg8-family proteins. 52, [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] Yet, only one LIRdependent interaction has been reported. 62 We have developed a database, iLIR@viral (http://ilir.uk/ virus/), that organizes information on the presence of LIR motifs in viral proteins. Additionally, a curated text-mining analysis of the literature permitted us to predict functional LIR motifs in viral proteins that have already been shown to associate with Atg8-family members.

The iLIR@viral database is a web resource freely available to the academic community at http://ilir.uk/virus/. Various functionalities are accessible under specific menus. The 'Classification' menu gives access to the complete list of putative LIR motifs in viral proteins. Two virus taxonomic systems have been used: the nomenclature used by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) to name the species, genus and families of each of the viruses cited in the database, and the Baltimore classification system that groups viruses depending on their genome and kind of replication (dsDNA, dsRNA, ssDNA, ssRNA and reverse-transcribing viruses) (see Methods). 63, 64 For each specific family or group of viruses, the data are presented in a table containing (i) the clickable UniProtKB accession number of the protein, (ii) the information related to the LIR-motif (position, sequence, PSSM score, if the pattern is recognized as an xLIR or WxxL motif and the presence of the motif in an intrinsically disordered region (ANCHOR)), (iii) the name of the protein and (iv) the name of the species. For some genera, no putative LIR-containing protein (LIRCP) could be identified; for accuracy in the classification, these are listed but appear in red (Fig. 1) .

The 'Search' menu allows the user to look in the database for a specific protein or virus order, family, subfamily, genus, species or common name. Uniprot identifiers can also be used in the search function.

The BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) menu offers the user to search the database using a protein sequence as query against the reviewed set of viral proteins from UniProt database. We have used Position-Specific Iterative (PSI) BLAST to search against the database. 65 This search can be run against any of the viral classification systems described above. By default, the BLAST search runs against all the data available in the database with a default e-value 0.01; nevertheless, the user has the possibility to run the BLAST search against a specific category (Baltimore classification) or Order taxonomic rank (ICTV classification), and define a different e-value. The results page displays the subject sequences from the database that match the query sequence. The LIR patterns are highlighted with red asterisks. The menus 'Bibliography' and 'Help' provide users with additional information. Finally, the 'Links' menu gives access to other iLIR web resources, inducing the iLIR search tool and the iLIR Database for eukaryote model organisms. 27, 28 Analysis of the content of the database

We have used the iLIR web resource (https://ilir.warwick.ac.uk) to identify LIRCPs in viruses (see Methods for details). 27, 28 Out of 16,609 reviewed viral sequences available from UniProt across 2569 individual viral species we found that 15,589 of them contain either xLIR or WxxL motifs. 6376 proteins Figure 1 . Screenshot of the iLIR@Viral database 'Classification' menu. Example for the ICTV classification system. The genera for which no LIRCPs were found appear in red.

contain xLIR motifs whereas 15,460 contain WxxL motifs. 6247 proteins contain both xLIR and WxxL motifs whereas 129 proteins contain only xLIR motifs (without containing WxxL patterns) and 9213 proteins contain only WxxL motifs (without xLIR patterns) (Table S1 ). We found a correlation between the total number of putative LIR motifs identified in a family and number of sequences ( Fig. 2A) . On average, we found 8.3 LIR motifs per sequence. The fact that viral sequences often refer to polyproteins instead of individual proteins is possibly an explanation of the high proportion of patterns identified.

The iLIR web resource can make the distinction between xLIR and WxxL patterns. 27, 28 We noticed that a vast majority of the motifs identified in viral proteins correspond to the WxxL pattern ( Fig. 2B and Table S1 ). The identification of putative LIR motifs has been done for all the reviewed sequences for viral proteins. Among the sequences sorted as putative LIR-containing proteins, 1517 sequences belong to 188 species of bacteriophages (Table S2 ). However, it is likely that these sequences correspond to false-positive hits as bacteria don't have an autophagy process. Using a hypergeometric test (see supplementary information), we compared the enrichment fold of proteins containing LIR motifs (LIRCPs) in bacteriophages with viruses infecting eukaryotes. We noticed that the enrichment fold for both xLIR and WxxL patterns in LIRCPs was higher in viruses infecting eukaryotes than in bacteriophages (Table S2) which is in line with the fact that autophagy has been reported only in eukaryotes.

We have previously identified all the verified and putative LIR motifs in eukaryotic model organisms. 28 We also compared the enrichment of putative LIR motifs in viruses infecting some of the model organisms (human, mouse, rat, and chicken) (Table S3) . Two hypergeometric tests have been conducted to compare the enrichment fold of LIRCPs in viruses against the host: one for proteins containing all combination of LIR patterns (i.e., either xLIR or WxxL, or both kind) and another considering only the proteins containing at least one xLIR motif (i.e., xLIR patterns alone or along with one or more WxxL patterns). We observed that when all the possible combinations of LIR patterns are taken into account, there is an enrichment of putative LIR motifs in viruses compared with the host organism for all 4 model organisms tested. However, there is an enrichment of xLIR patterns in the host compared with the infecting viruses.

The LIR motifs can be divided into 3 subtypes depending on the residue at the first position: W-, F-and Y-types. 8 It has been shown that the F-type LIR motif of mammalian ULK1 and ATG13 has a preference for GABARAP proteins, thus suggesting that the subtype of the LIR motifs could be related to a specificity toward Atg8family proteins. 7 Additionally F-type and Y-type LIR motifs are mostly contained in selective autophagy adaptor proteins. 8 We thus analyzed the distribution of W-, F-and Y-type of WxxL and xLIR patterns at the viral order and family levels (Table S4 and Fig. 2C, D) . We observed that 45% and 38% of the putative LIR motifs matching the WxxL pattern are of F-type and Y-type respectively. W-type motifs are the least represented, with about 17% of the patterns (Fig. 2C) . Similar distribution could be observed for the putative xLIR motifs with a higher variability across families, probably due to the low representation of xLIR motifs compared with WxxL patterns (Fig. 2D) .

To assess the trustworthiness of our in silico screening for LIRCPs in viruses, we compared our data with the already published viral proteins listed on the web resource Viral-Zone as modulators of autophagy. 66 ViralZone classifies 180 entries related to the activation of the host autophagy, and 163 entries linked to the inhibition of host autophagy. We found all these entries in our database.

Among viruses that inhibit autophagy, only 2 proteins have been shown to interact directly with mammalian Atg8- also Table S4 ). (D) Distribution of the W-, F-and Y-type of xLIR patterns across the different families (see also  Table S4 ).

family proteins: Viral infectivity factor (Vif) from HIV-1 binds to all Atg8-family proteins, and matrix protein 2 (M2) from influenza was shown to bind to LC3. Yet, influenza M2 protein is the only one that contains a LIR motif that has been experimentally validated. 52, 62 Other viral proteins listed in ViralZone as being related to inhibition of the autophagy process are the neurovirulence factor ICP34.5 and RNA-binding protein US11 from human herpesviruses, the protein Nef from HIV-1, and the protein TRS1 from human cytomegalovirus. 49, 61, 62, 67 Negative regulation of autophagy by ICP34.5 and TRS1 proteins depends on their ability to interact with BECN1/Beclin 1; 68-70 while US11 function has been linked to the protein kinase EIF2AK2/PKR. 71 Putative, or functional, LIR motifs could be identified for all these proteins using the iLIR web resource, except for the RNA-binding protein US11.

The protein M2 from influenza A virus is necessary and sufficient for the inhibition of the autophagic degradation of the virus by blocking the fusion between the autophagosomes and lysosomes. 49 These results were further confirmed and extended by Beale and colleagues who show that the cytoplasmic tail of M2 interacts in a LIR-dependent manner with LC3 and promotes the relocalization of LC3 at the plasma membrane. 62 We have identified a WxxL motif at positions 89 to 94 that has the highest PSSM score (8 to 9), and corresponds to the one experimentally verified (FVSI). 27, 72 It is an F-type LIR motif and the fact that M2 protein has been shown to block the autophagosome-lysosome fusion suggests that it may act as a an adaptor protein.

We were also able to identify one xLIR motif in the sequence of the accessory viral protein Nef of the virus HIV-1 group M subtype B (strain 89.6). Nef colocalizes with LC3 and BECN1, and contributes to the inhibition of autophagic maturation, thus protecting the virus from elimination by autophagy. 61, 67 The proteins TRS1 from human cytomegalovirus and neurovirulence factor ICP34.5 from human herpesvirus (HSV) both interact with BECN1 via a specific BECN1-binding domain. This interaction is required for the inhibition of autophagosome maturation and fusion with the lysosomes. [68] [69] [70] 73 While iLIR could detect several WxxL motifs in TRS1 sequence, a single one in an intrinsically disordered region was identified for ICP34.5 whose sequence (64-RQWLHV-69) is quite well conserved among 4 strains of HSV-1 and one strain of HSV-2. However, to date, there is no evidence of association between ICP34.5 and LC3 proteins.

We observed that 7% of the reviewed sequences that contains at least one putative LIR motif correspond to the genome polyprotein from various viruses. Because polyproteins are processed co-and post-translationally by both host and viral proteases, we ran a systematic PubMed search with the terms 'name of the virus C autophagy' followed by 'name of the virus C LC3' to restrain the result outcome as necessary, finally we looked for papers (excluding reviews and commentaries) that specifically mention proteins derived from the processing of the viral genome polyprotein.

Our literature searching strategy pinpointed several nonstructural viral proteins; one of those was the protein NS1 from Dengue viruses. Studies have shown that NS1 protein from Dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) colocalizes with LC3 and that DENV-2 particles and autophagosomes travel together during viral infection. 58, 74 In contrast to DENV-2, NS1 protein from DENV-3 displays a low level of colocalization with LC3. 75 Sequence alignment of NS1 proteins from DENV-2 and DENV-3 showed that they are highly conserved. However, checking for the presence of LIR motifs revealed a discrepancy between them. We observed that DENV-2 NS1 has an xLIR motif (ASFIEV) that is not recognized in any DENV-3 NS1 sequences due to the substitution F to L, as well as an additional WxxL motif with a PSSM score 12 (RAWNSL) that is absent in DENV-3 (SL to VW) (Fig. S1 ). It is possible that the absence of either the xLIR or WxxL motifs (or both) in DENV-3 is responsible for its lower affinity to LC3.

Other nonstructural proteins from different viruses interact with LC3 proteins. For instance, the nonstructural protein NS5A from Hepatitis C virus that colocalizes and can be coimmunoprecipitated with LC3 proteins when ectopically expressed in various hepatoma cell lines. 59, 76, 77 Also, the viral peptide 2BC and the protein 3A encoded by the genome polyprotein from Poliovirus type 1 interact with LC3-II. 60, 78 All these proteins contain WxxL motifs.

Finally, we were able to identify proteins from Zika virus that have been just recently related to autophagy. Independent studies have shown that Zika virus activates autophagy and that the formation of autophagosomes is crucial to the replication of the virus. [79] [80] [81] It appears that the nonstructural proteins NS4A and NS4B are responsible for the induction of autophagy in infected cells by inhibiting the AKT-MTOR signaling, and both of them contain 3 WxxL motifs. 80, 82 Very little is known about the relation between Zika virus infection and autophagy modulation. We have found several proteins encoded by Zika genome polyprotein that contain LIR motifs, that could be good candidates for experimental validation.

Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved and highly regulated, intracellular catabolic mechanism that is essential for maintaining homeostasis and coping with nutrient starvation. It is increasingly appreciated that autophagy can be highly selective, and that xenophagy, the selective autophagy of pathogens, is an important aspect of the immune response, which protects against infection. A vast array of viruses are associated with autophagy, and we have found several viral proteins containing putative LIR motifs that are thought to interact with the autophagic machinery via Atg8-family proteins. A continued research effort to better understand how these viral proteins interact with the autophagic machinery may provide therapeutic strategies and ultimately lead to the discovery of novel pharmacological agents to fight viral infections.

Protein sequences of all reviewed viral proteins were downloaded from Uniprot database vailable at: http://www.uni prot.org/ [Accessed 20 September 2016]. xLIR and WxxL patterns for these proteins were identified using the approach suggested previously. 27, 28 For a given protein, information related to the start and end of LIR pattern, actual LIR sequence, PSSM score (Position specific scoring matrix), similar LIRCPs and presence or absence xLIR and WxxL in intrinsically disordered region were obtained.

The taxonomic lineage obtained from UniProt for all the reviewed viral proteins correspond to the Baltimore classification system. To do the conversion between the Baltimore and ICTV classification systems, we matched the organism name for each reviewed sequence from UniProt with the organism names obtained from the ICTV master species list 2015 v1, available at: https://talk.ictvonline.org/files/master-species-lists/ m/msl/5945 [Accessed 20 September 2016].

The differences between the classification systems were identified through a battery of SQL queries. The details of these are attached in Tables S5, S6 and S7. Levenshtein distance (also known as edit distance) was used to compare the species name that belongs to a particular genus and family between both the classification systems. Levenshtein distance is defined as the minimal number of characters required to replace, insert or delete to transform one string into another. The Levenshtein distance is symmetric and it holds:

Here, 'x' and 'y' are 2 strings and d(x,y) is the distance between 'x' and 'y' put as minimal cost of operations to transform 'x' to 'y'. The complexity of the algorithm is O(m Ã n), where n and m are the lengths of 2 strings. 83 We used Perl extension for approximate matching (Search.cpan. org, (2016). String-Approx-3.27. Retrieved from: http://search.cpan.org/ CPAN/authors/id/J/JH/JHI/String-Approx-3.27.tar.gz)

The closer the value of Levenshstein distance to zero, the closer are the species names.

Using this approach, we could reliably justify the ICTV classification of 14055 out 15589 proteins loaded into the database.

Characteristics of fever and response to antipyretic therapy in military personnel with adenovirus-positive community- acquired pneumonia

Background: In 2014, an outbreak of adenoviral pneumonia occurred in the Korean military training center. However, there are limited data on the characteristics of the fever and its response to antipyretic therapy in immunocompetent adults with adenovirus-positive community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Methods: The medical records of the patients who were admitted to the Armed Forces Chuncheon Hospital for the treatment of CAP between January 2014 and December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into three groups, namely, the adenovirus-positive (Adv) group, the adenovirus-negative (Non-Adv) group and the unknown pathogen group, according to the results of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and sputum culture used to measure adenovirus and other bacteria or viruses in respiratory specimens. We evaluated and compared the demographics, clinicolaboratory findings and radiological findings upon admission between the two groups. Results: Out of the 251 military personnel with CAP during the study periods, 67 were classified into the Adv group, while 134 were classified into the Non-Adv group and 50 were classified into the unknown pathogen group. The patients in the Adv group had a longer duration of fever after admission (3.2 ± 1.6 vs. 1.9 ± 1.2 vs. 2.2 ± 1.5 days, P = 0.018) and symptom onset (5.8 ± 2.2 vs. 3.9 ± 2.5 vs. 3.7 ± 2.0 days, P = 0.006) than patients in the Non-Adv and unknown pathogen groups, respectively. The patients in the Adv group had a higher mean temperature at admission (37.8 ± 0.3 vs. 37.3 ± 0.3 vs. 37.3 ± 0.3, P = 0.005), and more patients were observed over 40 and 39 to 40(14.9% vs. 2.2% vs. 4.0%, 35.8% vs. 3.7% vs. 6.0%, P < 0.001) than those in the Non-Adv and unknown pathogen groups, respectively. The Adv group more commonly had no response or exhibited adverse events after antipyretic treatment compared to the Non-Adv group (17.9% vs. 1.5%, 35.0% vs. 4.3%, P < 0.001, P = 0.05, respectively). In addition, the time from admission to overall clinical stabilization was significantly longer in the patients in the Adv group than in those in the Non-Adv group (4.3 ± 2.8 vs. 2.9 ± 1.8 days, P = 0.034, respectively). Furthermore, no significant difference in the length of hospital stay was observed between the two groups, and no patient died in either group. Conclusion: In this study, Adv-positive CAP in immunocompetent military personnel patients had distinct fever characteristics and responses to antipyretic treatment.

Adenoviruses (Adv) are nonenveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that can cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections either in sporadic fashion or as epidemics. Currently, 49 distinct Adv serotypes have been isolated from humans. Adv typically cause mild self-limited respiratory infections. Although Adv can cause a variety of clinical manifestations, in immunocompromised patients, adenovirus infection often leads to fatal outcomes. For example, in immunodeficiency states such as a solid organ or stem cell transplantation, severe adenovirus infection may occur, with mortality up to 80% [1] [2] [3] [4] .

Outbreaks of adenoviral pneumonia have been occasionally reported in young adult women or military personnel [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Respiratory tract infection is the leading cause of hospitalization of military trainees in the medical field. A study by the US military showed that 10% of recruits at boot camp were infected with Adv, and 90% of patients with pneumonia were infected with adenovirus [10, 11] . In 2006, a study by the South Korean military reported that the prevalence of Adv was 61% among military recruits with acute respiratory symptoms [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Adv may also progress to pneumonia. Recently, several case series were reported describing recruits that died in boot camp due to severe adenoviral pneumonia in South Korea since 2012 [13, [15] [16] [17] . Even if mortality results or clinical outcome of Adv infection could be affected by selection bias, it has been reported that Adv infection may be severe with a higher incidence of progression to respiratory and multiorgan failure compared to other viral etiologies with the exception of influenza. Thus, some clinical data have been reported regarding predictive factors of respiratory failure associated with Adv infection [18, 19] .

If Adv infection can be diagnosed early, increased monitoring and early applied organ support may improve the clinical outcome of these patients. However, sufficient data on the distinctive characteristics of Adv infections in immunocompetent patients is currently unavailable. We previously observed that adenoviruspositive community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients have a high fever and respond differently to antipyretic treatment compared to CAP patients who test positive for other viruses or bacteria. Therefore, the primary goal of this study was to compare the clinical characteristics of Adv-and Non-Adv-positive CAP patients among immunocompetent military personnel and to identify the distinctive characteristics.

This study was a single-center, retrospective cohort study. We reviewed the medical records of patients who were admitted to the Armed Forces Chuncheon Hospital (Gangwon Province, South Korea, the Referral Hospital for Gangwon Province) for CAP treatment between January of 2014 and December of 2016. Based on the unique characteristics of the Korean military medical system, all military personnel was treated initially in the military hospital despite a lack of diagnostic modalities. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the Armed Forces Medical Command (AFMC-16051-IRB-16-041), which waived the need for informed consent because of the retrospective observational nature of the study.

The patients were included in this study when they 1) were admitted for CAP treatment; and 2) had viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests performed on the upper respiratory specimen. The exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) a respiratory viral PCR test was not performed; 2) they had incomplete records; 3) they were immediately transferred to a tertiary hospital for advanced care; and 4) the primary reason for admission was to manage comorbid diseases.

CAP was defined using the definition set forth by the Infectious Society of America/American Thoracic Society Consensus Guidelines [20] . In short, CAP was diagnosed when the patients had symptoms associated with respiratory tract infections and had new-onset lung infiltration or pleural effusion on chest X-rays or chest computed tomography scans. We defined fever as any temperature greater than or equal to 38°C recorded by the tympanic route. The body temperatures of all patients were checked every hour at admission day. During the days after admission, the body temperature was often measured within 1 h when patients had a febrile sense or worsening signs of inflammation. We also recorded body temperature at the beginning of antipyretics administration. There is no standardized antipyretic treatment protocol for fever control. In our study, antipyretic therapy was administered upon reaching a body temperature ≥ of 38°C. The interval of antipyretics administration was according to pharmacodynamics, although we performed additional antipyretics treatment when patients had a fever (two consecutive measurements ≥38°C) and deterioration of clinical symptoms, including myalgia, general weakness, cough, nasal congestion, or dyspnea within 6 h after antipyretics administration. Responsiveness to antipyretic treatment was classified as follows: a complete response was recorded when a body temperature drop below 38°C was observed after antipyretics treatment and sustained throughout; a partial response was recorded when a body temperature drop below 38°C was observed but there was a resurge during observation or a need for additional antipyretics; and no response was recorded when a sustained body temperature above or equal to 38°C was observed after antipyretics use. Unresponsive to initial antibiotic treatment was defined as observed deterioration as evidenced by worsening of clinical symptoms and signs and/or progression of lesions on radiological studies after 48 to 72 h of initial antibiotics treatment.

All data, including age, sex, smoking history, comorbid conditions, symptoms and clinical signs, initial laboratory and radiological findings, culture results, pneumonia severity index, clinical course, length of hospital stay, and survival outcome were collected from electronic medical records. We evaluated etiologies by sputum, nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal secretions, blood, and urine using a microbiological culturing approach. Respiratory specimens were typically obtained from selfextracting sputum. When sputum specimens could not be obtained, upper respiratory tract specimens, such as oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs were used for viral PCR tests. Multiplex real-time PCR was performed using a Real-Q RV Detection kit (BioSewoom, Seoul, Korea) with a Roche Light Cycler 480 II instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Respiratory viruses included in this test are as follows; adenovirus, rhinovirus, influenza virus A/B, respiratory syncytial virus A/B, metapneumovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, and parainfluenza virus 1/2/3. All patients were given chest X-rays and/or high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) at the time of our emergency department visit.

Initial antibiotic agents were intravenously administered to all of the patients. Initial antibiotic regimens were followed by adherence to the "Treatment Guidelines for Community-acquired Pneumonia in Korea: An Evidence-based Approach to Appropriate Antimicrobial Therapy" from The Korean Academy of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases [21] . The antipyretic agents and regimens used in this study were as follows. Propacetamol was intravenously administered at a dose of 1 to 2 g as needed to a maximum of 8 g per day. Acetaminophen was given orally at a dose of 2 tablets (650 mg per tablet) every 8 h to a maximum of 6 tablets per day. Physical cooling methods applied to all febrile patients included external air, ice bag, or water blanket techniques.

The data are presented as the means ± standard deviation or as the median [interquartile range] for continuous variables and as numbers and percentages for categorical variables. The data were analyzed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for normal distribution. The data were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test or Student's t-test for continuous variables and the χ 2 or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 23.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and a two-sided P-value < 0.05 was considered to indicate significance.

During the study period, there were 445 CAP patients admitted to the Armed Forces Chuncheon Hospital (Fig. 1 ). All patients were admitted via the emergency department. Out of 445 cases, 194 cases were excluded. The reasons for exclusion were no respiratory viral PCR test for 170 patients, incomplete data for 20 patients, immediately transferred to the tertiary medical center for two patients, and admission for treatment of underlying diseases for two patients. Two patients who were admitted suspicious combined to underlying disease managed to acute asthma exacerbation. Consequently, 251 patients were enrolled in this study, among whom 67 patients had a positive PCR test for adenovirus (Adv group), while 184 patients had a negative PCR test for adenovirus (Non-Adv group). Among the Non-Adv group patients, no pathogen was detected in 50 patients in all culture assays (unknown pathogen group), while 134 patients were diagnosed with other viruses, bacteria, and combined pathogens (Non-Adv group). Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the patients in the Adv and Non-Adv groups at admission. The median age was 21.6 years, and all patients were healthy males prior to the onset of illness. The number of current smokers was significantly higher in the Adv group than in the Non-Adv group (22.2% vs. 5.4%, respectively), with recent smokers (< 30 days) only identified in the Adv group (n = 4). A few patients had an underlying disease, such as asthma (n = 3), allergic rhinitis (n = 3), and pneumothorax (n = 2). No differences in the duration of symptoms and the time from symptom onset to admission were observed between the two groups (3.6 ± 1.8 d vs. 3.2 ± 2.3 d, P = 0.224). All patients had clinical symptoms and signs of upper or lower respiratory tract infection. Adv group patients showed more symptomatic instabilities, such as fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and nasal congestion. At admission, initial vital signs and pneumonia severity index (PSI) scores were not significantly different between the two groups.

We compared the laboratory and radiologic findings between the Adv and Non-Adv groups ( Table 2 ). The percentage of patients having leukopenia and thrombocytopenia was higher in the Adv patients P < 0.001), while leukocytosis was more common in the Non-Adv group patients (P = 0.035).

The levels of infection markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin showed no difference between the two groups. In addition, total bilirubin and creatinine levels showed no significant difference between the two groups.

Possible causative agents were identified in 100% of the Adv group patients and in 72.8% (134/184) of the Non-Adv group patients. In some instances, Adv group patients had coinfections with viruses, such as rhinovirus (n = 5), influenza A virus (n = 4), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 1), and parainfluenza virus (n = 1). Bacteria or combined etiologies were more common in the Non-Adv group patients. Rhinovirus (40/184, 21.7%) was most commonly identified as the pathogen in the Non-Adv group patients. The most common bacterial pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae in the Adv group patients (11/67, 16.4%) and Haemophilus influenzae in the Non-Adv group patients (52/184, 28.3%).

The most common radiological feature was groundglass opacity with consolidation in the Adv group and consolidation in the Non-Adv group (P < 0.001). Unilateral distribution was dominant in both groups (83.5% vs. 72.7%), however multilobar (≥ 3 lobes) involvement was more common in the Non-Adv group (9.0 vs. 22.3%, P = 0.015). The presence of pleural effusion was not significantly different between the two groups.

Comparisons of fever and response to antipyretics Figure 2 shows the changes in mean body temperature at admission and during the 7 days after admission between Adv and Non-Adv group patients. In addition, we also compared the fever and response to antipyretic treatment between the patients in the no pathogen group and in the Adv and Non-Adv groups, the results of which are shown in Table 3 . In general, Adv group patients had a much longer duration of fever after admission than the Non-Adv patients (3.2 ± 1.6 days vs. 1.9 ± 1.2 days, 2.2 ± 1.5 days, P = 0.018) and symptom onset (5.8 ± 2.2 days vs. 3.9 ± 2.5 days, 3.7 ± 2.0 days, P = 0.006). To evaluate the degree of fever, we assessed the mean temperature and number of patients to the maximal temperature at admission. The Adv group patients had higher a mean temperature at admission (37.8 ± 0.3°C vs. 37.3 ± 0.3°C vs. 37.3 ± 0.2°C, P = 0.005), and more observed instances of a temperature of over 40 and 39 to 40°C (P < 0.001). The Adv group patients took longer to attain the maximal fall in body temperature than the Non-Adv and unknown pathogen group patients at admission (10.2 ± 5.6 vs. 8.0 ± 4.5 vs. 8.6 ± 5.5, P = 0.015).

Approximately 18% of Adv group patients had no response to antipyretic treatment, which represented a higher proportion compared with that observed in the Non-Adv or unknown pathogen group patients (P < 0.001). However, the proportion of complete response to antipyretic treatment was comparatively lower in patients in the Adv group than that observed in the Non-Adv or unknown pathogen groups.

Comparison of clinicolaboratory findings between the Adv and non-Adv groups in patients who were unresponsive to initial antibiotics treatment

The physician suspected the patient of having atypical pathogens when they had persistent or deteriorating symptoms or signs despite treatment with appropriate empirical antibiotics for 2-3 days. Thus, we compared the clinicolaboratory findings between Adv and Non-Adv group patients who were unresponsive to the initial antibiotics treatment ( Table 4 ). The number of patients who did not a response to initial antibiotics treatment was 47 and 50 in the Adv and Non-Adv groups, respectively. The percentage of patients having leukocytosis and monocytopenia was higher in the Adv patients, although there was no significant difference in white blood cell and platelet counts between the two groups. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, which were a showed a significant difference in all study patients, showed no difference in patients with unresponsiveness to initial antibiotics treatment (P = 0.720, P = 0.733, respectively). A greater number of Adv group patients exhibited no response to antipyretic treatment compared with the Non-Adv group patients (25.5% vs. 10.0%, P = 0.045) as well as the number of patients to reach over 40°C and 39 to 40°C (P = 0.003). In addition, the Adv group patients had a higher mean temperature at admission than the Non-Adv group patients (37.8 ± 0.3 vs. 37.3 ± 0.2, P = 0.005). Table 5 compares the clinicolaboratory variables between the combined Adv (cAdv), Non-Adv, and only Adv identified pathogen (OAIP) group patients. Compared to the cAdv and Non-Adv patients, more patients in the OAIP group exhibited the following characteristics: were currently smoking; had leukopenia, lymphopenia, monocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia; exhibited a longer duration of fever after symptom onset; had a higher maximal temperature at admission (over 40°C and 39-40°C); and exhibited no response to antipyretics at admission.

All patients received empirical antibiotic treatment (Table 6 ) as follows: a 3rd generation cephalosporin plus azithromycin was the most common regimen (n = 243, 96.8%), followed by piperacillin/tazobactam plus respiratory quinolone (n = 5, 2.0%). The change in antibiotics treatment regimen was more frequent in the Adv group patients than in the Non-Adv patients (70.1% vs. 27.2%, P = 0.024). The duration of antibiotic treatment was not significantly different between the two groups. In our study, we did not evaluate the administration of cidofovir or adjuvant intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). In addition, there were no patients who received mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. At admission, the mean dose of antipyretics administered was higher in the Adv group patients than in the Non-Adv group patients (5.52 vs. 4.30 g, P = 0.032), although the overall duration of antipyretics was not significantly different between the two groups. In this study, we identified adverse events after antipyretics administration, such as hypotension, gastrointestinal trouble, skin rash, and elevated liver enzyme, which were commonly observed in the Adv group patients (P = 0.005).

The time to overall clinical stabilization from admission was significantly longer in the Adv group patients than in the Non-Adv group patients (4.3 ± 2.8 d vs. 2.9 ± 1.8 d, P = 0.034). In addition, the length of hospital was not significantly different between the two groups, and no patient died in our study.

In our study, we described the clinical characteristics of Adv-positive community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompetent adult patients. The most important findings were that Adv group patients had a longer duration of fever after symptom onset and admission, a higher mean body temperature at admission, a higher number of patients with a body temperature over 39°C Fig. 2 Comparison to the changes in mean body temperature between the Adv-positive and Adv-negative group patients at admission day (a) and within 7 days after admission (b). a Changes in mean temperature in four hours between the Adv and Non-Adv group patients within 24 h at admission (37.6 ± 0.22 vs. 37.1 ± 0.25, P = 0.005), b Comparison of the mean daily temperature between the Adv and Non-Adv group patients for a week (P = 0.156) at admission, a longer duration of the maximal fall in body temperature at admission, and higher rate of no response to antipyretic treatment at admission compared to the Non-Adv group patients. In addition, the instances of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were greater in the Adv group patients than in the Non-Adv group patients, although in patients who were unresponsive to the initial antibiotics treatment, there was no difference between the two groups. Some epidemiological studies of Adv in South Korea military trainees and personnel have been performed. Yoo et al. [15] reported that adenovirus was identified in 33.0% of all specimens in febrile respiratory illness (FRI) or pneumonia patients. This study was of reviewed military patients with FRI or pneumonia who were tested for respiratory viruses from October 2014 to May 2016. The proportion of patients with pneumonia and the hospitalization rate did not differ between those with and without adenovirus infection. However, adenovirus-infected patients had a significantly higher risk of requiring intensive care or mechanical Table 3 Characteristics of fever and response to antipyretics between Adv, Non-Adv, and unknown pathogen group ventilator support. These notable findings indicate that adenovirus infection has been occasionally associated with mortality and morbidity with loss in combat strength and an increase in the cost of care.

To date, little data has been reported on the characteristics of fever during Adv infection, especially in immunocompetent patients. In this study, we compared the characteristics of fever in Adv and Non-Adv group patients. The Adv group patients had a longer duration of fever and a higher proportion of peak body temperature than patients infected with other various viral respiratory pathogens or unknown pathogens. Similarly, Ho et al [22] observed that viral mono-pathogen patients had a higher mean body temperature than bacterial mono-pathogen patients. In addition, dualpathogen patients, such as S. pneumoniae with either influenza A or B, had a higher mean body temperature, although not significantly different from the respective mono-pathogens. However, there is still a lack of detailed data on the specific pathogen-related clinical characteristics, especially fever, in immunocompetent patients. Thus, our data is more likely to aid physicians in determining further diagnostic or therapeutic considerations at the time of admission. We also evaluated the response to antipyretic treatment between the Adv and Non-Adv groups. Our data showed that the Adv group patients exhibited a higher proportion of individuals with no response to antipyretic treatment compared with the Non-Adv or unknown pathogen group patients. Weisse et al. [23] evaluated the effect of acetaminophen on fever in bacterial vs. viral infections in 100 children. They concluded that there is no correlation between a fever response to acetaminophen and the etiology of the fever, revealing no usefulness in the response to antipyretic treatment in predicting etiologies of pneumonia. However, our data suggest that there may be a difference in the antipyretic response to Adv compared to other etiologies, and this is the first such data reported for immunocompetent adults.

Our study had several limitations. First, our study was a retrospective design in a single-center, so confounding variables, such as antibiotics regimen or inconsistent timing of antipyretics administration, may have possibly affected the clinical course of fever or response to antipyretic treatment. Second, our study had few reflected unmeasurable variables, such as the genotype of adenovirus, so the difference in the severity of illness between the Adv and Non-Adv groups may have led to the difference in the characteristics of fever and its response to antipyretics. Third, we conducted our study in a military hospital, so our cohort was not representative of the general population, since the military environment has different characteristics, such as living environment, nutrition/immune status, and mode of pathogen spread. Fourth, there was selection bias in that all patients admitted with CAP could not have respiratory PCR tests performed; the examination was limited to an upper respiratory tract, and Adv serotype or viral burden analyses were not performed. Fifth, several potentially relevant pathogens were identified in the study patients. Thus, it is uncertain whether adenovirus was the "leading" pathogen in all patients with multiple pathogens that included adenovirus. Additionally, it is uncertain whether the patients with unknown pathogens were not infected with pathogens.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the characteristics of fever and response to antipyretic therapy in immunocompetent adult patients with adenovirus-infected CAP. Patients in the Adv group had some clinical characteristics that were significantly different from those in the Non-Adv group, including a longer duration of fever, a high fever (over 39°C), and a higher proportion of no response to antipyretic treatment at admission.

The Rational Design of Therapeutic Peptides for Aminopeptidase N using a Substrate-Based Approach OPEN

The M1 family of metalloproteases represents a large number of exopeptidases that cleave single amino acid residues from the N-terminus of peptide substrates. One member of this family that has been well studied is aminopeptidase N (APN), a multifunctional protease known to cleave biologically active peptides and aide in coronavirus entry. The proteolytic activity of APN promotes cancer angiogenesis and metastasis making it an important target for cancer therapy. To understand the substrate specificity of APN for the development of targeted inhibitors, we used a global substrate profiling method to determine the P1-P4′ amino acid preferences. The key structural features of the APN pharmacophore required for substrate recognition were elucidated by x-ray crystallography. By combining these substrate profiling and structural data, we were able to design a selective peptide inhibitor of APN that was an effective therapeutic both in vitro and in vivo against APN-expressing prostate cancer models.

The M1 aminopeptidase family is a group of Zn 2+ -dependent peptidases expressed ubiquitously by both fetal and adults tissues. Protein levels of M1 aminopeptidases have been documented in the brain, pancreas, lung, intestines, prostate, heart, endothelial cells and in components of the immune system 1, 2 . Each M1 aminopeptidase demonstrates unique substrate specificity by preferring certain amino acids at the N-terminus of their endogenous substrates. For example, aminopeptidase B prefers basic amino acids, whereas aminopeptidase A prefers acidic amino acids 3 . The substrate specificities of the aminopeptidases allow each of them to selectively catalyze the activation or metabolism of bioactive peptides. The most studied member of the mammalian M1 aminopeptidase family is aminopeptidase N (APN), also known as CD13. APN exists as a dimeric 110 kDa cell surface protein with a small N-terminal intracellular domain, a single-pass transmembrane anchor, a small extracellular stalk, and a large ectodomain on the C-terminus 4 . Cleaving after neutral amino acids, as implied by the "N" in its name, APN degrades peptides that are involved in different physiological pathways, including pain sensation and mood disorder by inactivating enkephalin, as well as regulating blood pressure by cleaving angiotensin III 1, 5 . APN is considered to be a "moonlighting ectoenzyme", possessing functions other than its role as a peptidase 1 . Independent of its enzymatic activity, APN can also act a receptor for viral infection and as an adhesion molecule 6 .

In cancer, APN is widely over-expressed on the surface of a number of different cell types, ranging from endothelial cells to solid tumor cells. Enzymatically active APN has been documented to play import roles in tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, cell migration, and metastasis 7-9 . As a result of its role in cancer development and metastasis, APN has been a major target for drug development. The direct enzymatic activity of APN has been targeted using the potent transition-state analogue inhibitor bestatin (ubenimex) in several clinical trials 8, 10 . Although bestatin inhibits nearly a dozen aminopeptidases, it has demonstrated therapeutic benefit in acute myeloid leukemia, gastric cancer, and squamous cell lung carcinomas [11] [12] [13] . Other small molecule inhibitors of APN, including the natural product curucumin, have been developed and are undergoing testing in the clinic and preclinical models 10 . As with bestatin, specificity has plagued these next-generation compounds due to the limited interactions small molecules can make with the APN pharmacophore. Additional strategies for the therapeutic targeting of APN have utilized tumor-homing peptides based on the NGR motif that bind to APN and deliver

cytotoxins to cancer cells 14 . One of these agents, a cyclic version of the NGR peptide complexed to the human tumor necrosis factor alpha, is currently undergoing Phase III clinical trials in mesothelioma 15 .

Understanding substrate specificity is essential to the design of molecules that inhibit the enzymatic activity of APN. Although the preference of APN for neutral amino acid residues at the P1 position has been generally established, little is known about the physical basis for this preference and even less is known about the downstream prime-side specificity of APN. In this study, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of APN substrate specificity and identified key structural features that dictate the specificity of the protease. Using an unbiased mass spectrometry-based peptide library assay, we determined the P1-P4′ substrate preferences of APN and prioritized candidate peptide substrates in the library for rational inhibitor design. Six crystal structures of APN complexed with different amino acids in the P1 position were solved and provided a structural basis for the P1 substrate specificity. From these crystal structures, a peptide was modelled into the specificity pocket to highlight key interactions responsible for dictating the extended prime-side substrate specificity. Using a substrate derived from the peptide library, we developed a novel substrate-based cyclic peptide inhibitor that was specific for APN. Our inhibitor specifically bound to APN-expressing prostate cancer cell lines in vitro, decreasing their clonogenic survival, and was an effective therapeutic, leading to decreased tumor growth in vivo in xenograft models of prostate cancer.

To determine the substrate specificity of APN, recombinant human APN (hAPN) was profiled using an unbiased and global substrate profiling approach referred to as Multiplex Substrate Profiling by Mass Spectrometry (MSP-MS) 16 . The MSP-MS assay uses a 228-member library of 14-mer synthetic and unmodified peptide substrates that were rationally designed to maximize physicochemical diversity within a small sequence space 17 . For specificity determination, hAPN was incubated with the MSP-MS peptide library and time-dependent peptide cleavage products were identified with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Statistical analysis that considers both cleaved and uncleaved positions in the peptide library 18 was subsequently performed to construct an iceLogo representation of hAPN P1-P4′ specificity as well as a corresponding heat map based on comprehensive Z-scores for each position (Fig. 1A ,B, and Supplemental Figure 1 ).

In agreement with prior P1 specificity profiling using single-amino acid fluorogenic substrates 5 , hAPN displayed broad specificity at the P1 position. In particular, hAPN exhibited a significant preference for P1 hydrophobic residues (such as norleucine, leucine, tryptophan, and alanine), whereas proline, asparagine, and acidic residues (aspartic acid and glutamic acid) were significantly disfavored. We note that norleucine is used as an isostere for methionine in the MSP-MS library. Inspection of individual peptide cleavage events within the MSP-MS time course supported these overarching P1 specificity preferences with N-terminal cleavages being impaired or blocked by disfavored residues at the P1 (or neo-P1) position ( Fig. 1C and Supplemental Figure 2 ). In shown; "n" is norleucine). Residues with a positive percent difference are considered favorable at a given position; residues with a negative percent difference are considered disfavorable. (B) Heat map representation of hAPN P1-P4′ specificity at the 60 min assay time point calculated using Z-scores at each position. Favored residues are colored blue (Z-score > 0) and disfavored residues are colored red (Z-score < 0). iceLogo representations and heat maps for the 15, 240, and 1200 min assay time points are provided (Supplementary Figure 1 ). (C) Example 14-mer peptides from the MSP-MS library are shown with primary and secondary cleavages indicated with a blue arrow. "X" indicates that no cleavage was detected at the indicated position.

Scientific RepoRts | 7: 1424 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-01542-5 addition to providing P1 specificity for hAPN, our global analysis revealed numerous non-prime-side specificity features. In particular, these features include, among others, a significant preference for certain hydrophobic residues (such as tryptophan, phenylalanine, and proline) at the P4′ position, a preference for serine/threonine or phenylalanine at the P2′ and P3′ positions, and a decreased preference for proline at the P1′ position (Fig. 1A ,B, and Supplemental Figure 2 ). Structural basis for APN P1 substrate specificity. To provide a molecular basis for APN substrate recognition and catalysis, crystal structures were solved of APN bound to natural free amino acids with varied P1 preferences (methionine, leucine, arginine, glycine, isoleucine, and aspartic acid) to probe the influences of the extended binding pocket. Due to the nearly identical architecture of the active sites and P1 specificities of pAPN and hAPN, pAPN was used for analysis because of its propensity to form high quality crystals 5, 6 . The crystal structure of pAPN in complex with the free amino acid alanine and a seven amino acid poly-alanine peptide substrate were initially determined ( Figure 2 ). The seahorse-shaped ectodomain of pAPN contains 4 domains, head, side, body, and tail ( Fig. 2A) . The N-terminal residue of peptide substrates is firmly anchored in the spacious active site of APN between the head and body domains with residues Gln208, Glu350 and Glu406 forming hydrogen bonds with the free N-terminal amine group (Fig. 2B,C) . The nitrogen of the scissile peptide bond forms a hydrogen bond with the electron-repelling carbonyl oxygen of Ala348, while the carbonyl oxygen of the scissile peptide bond interacts with the electron-attracting zinc and Tyr472 (Fig. 2B,C) . The resonating electrons of the scissile peptide bond are pulled towards the carbonyl oxygen, thus, destabilizing the bond and making it available to nucleophilic attack by the zinc-activated water molecule. At the same time, the activated nitrogen of the scissile peptide bond is also ready to accept a proton from the catalytic water through the side chain of Glu384. In the presence of free alanine, the carbonyl oxygen of Ala348 from pAPN maintains a hydrogen bond with the carboxyl group of the free alanine, suggesting that the carboxyl group oxygen of free alanine near Ala348 is protonated. Protonation of this carboxyl group oxygen of free alanine is due to simultaneous deprotonation of the other carboxyl group oxygen of free alanine by zinc and Tyr472 (Fig. 2D,E) .

Because pAPN forms the same interactions with a free alanine and the N-terminal alanine residue of a poly-alanine peptide substrate, we believe that the crystal structures of pAPN complexed with free amino acids reflect the interactions between pAPN and the N-terminal amino acid residues of at least simple peptide substrates 4 . All of the free amino acids in the crystal structures bound to pAPN in a similar manner as alanine, with the exception of key differences in their side chain interactions. The amino acid side chains were oriented in a pocket in the pAPN body domain with hydrophobic walls and an open end (Fig. 3A) . The side chains with different lengths were able to fit into the pocket because of the open end and were found to primarily form hydrophobic interactions with the walls of the pocket (Fig. 3B ). For example, C β , C γ , and C ε of the methionine side chain formed hydrophobic interactions with Met349/Gln208, Ala346, and Phe467 on the pocket walls (Fig. 3B ). Polar side chains were also able to form additional interactions with pAPN as in the case of arginine where the guanidine group formed a cationic-Pi interaction with Phe467 (Fig. 3B ). In general, the APN-binding affinity of amino acids is positively associated with the extent of hydrophobic or other affinity-increasing interactions between their side chains and the pocket walls. Consequently, amino acids with long, nonpolar side chains like leucine generally have high APN-binding affinity. Analysis of the crystal structures of pAPN complexed with non-favored amino acids found that those residues all shared one unique feature -their side chains had unfavorable interactions with the catalytically critical carbonyl oxygen of Ala348 from pAPN (Fig. 3B ). For example, the C γ atom of isoleucine was 2.4 Å away from the carbonyl oxygen of Ala348, respectively ( Fig. 3B ). At these short distances, a strong van der waals (VDW) repulsion existed between the atoms. Additionally, the O δ group of aspartic acid formed an unfavorable charge repulsion with the carbonyl oxygen of Ala348 (Fig. 3B) . As a comparison, the side chains and disfavored (Ile and Asp) P1 residues for APN. pAPN residues are in magenta, and amino acids are in green. The catalytically critical hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of Ala348 and the C-terminal carboxyl group of amino acids is shown as a red dashed line in the structure with Ala, but is omitted in other panels for clarity. The interactions between the carbonyl oxygen of Ala348 and amino acid side chains are shown as black dashed lines. The distance between the carbonyl oxygen of Ala348 and the nearest atom on amino acid side chains is shown as a bidirectional arrow.

Scientific RepoRts | 7: 1424 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-01542-5 of amino acids that are good APN substrates form weak or no interactions with the carbonyl oxygen of Ala348 (Fig. 3B ).

To identify sequences for inhibitor development, a selection of 14-mer peptides from the MSP-MS library that underwent complete hydrolysis during the assay were compared using label-free quantitation of peptide cleavage kinetics (Supplemental Figure 2 ). Five-residue long peptides containing P1-P4′ residues from primary cleavages in the library were synthesized and tested for their ability to prevent the cleavage of a fluorogenic alanine substrate by hAPN. From these initial peptides, only nHSPW was able to appreciably inhibit substrate cleavage with an IC 50 of 6.5 μM, whereas the remaining peptides all had IC 50 values above 500 μM ( Table 1) . Replacement of the P1 residue norleucine of nHSPW with either leucine or alanine did not have a significant impact on the IC 50 , resulting in low μM inhibitors. Complete removal of the P1 norleucine, resulting in the 4-mer peptide HSPW, only decreased the potency of the inhibitor to 43 μM.

To define the key prime-side interactions accounting for the inhibition of these HSPW-containing sequences, the peptide LHSPW was modeled into our pAPN crystal structure (Fig. 4A ). For modeling purposes, the P1 residue was selected as leucine since we had solved a crystal structure with that residue in the P1 position -we were unable to get a crystal structure of norleucine -and leucine was the second most favored P1 residue in our MSP-MS assay. The first three residues (Leu1-His2-Ser3) were modeled from a poly-alanine structure and last two residues (Pro4-Trp5) were from the structure of pAPN complexed with substance P, which also contains a proline at the 4th position (PDB ID: 4HOM). As predicted from the P1 structural data, the side chain of Leu1 in both peptides points into a hydrophobic pocket surrounded by APN residues M349, Q208, and F467 (Fig. 4B) . The side chain of His2 forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl oxygen of pAPN residue A346. Pro4 forms a turn in the peptide, whereas the side chains of Ser3 and Trp5 both form VDW interactions with APN residue Y472 (Fig. 4C) .

Using the HSPW core sequence, we next sought to create true inhibitors of APN that were not cleavable substrates and with the potential proteolytic stability required for in vivo studies. Addition of N-terminal capping groups to the peptides completely abrogated any inhibitory ability. Next, the peptides were cyclized through the formation of a disulfide bond using N and C-terminal cysteine residues (Cys-XHSPW-Cys = cyc-XHSPW). The cyclization of the parent nHSPW peptide through cysteine residues (cyc-nHSPW) also eliminated any measureable inhibition of APN; however, cyclization of the leucine derivative (cyc-LHSPW) yielded an inhibitor with a K i of 24.7 μM. Truncation of the core sequence revealed the importance of Pro4 and Trp5 in determining the affinity of the cyclic peptide, resulting in K i values of 121.4 μM and >500 μM for the cyclic tetrapeptide and tripeptide derivatives, respectively.

Biological Evaluation of cyc-LHSPW. Next, the specificity of the lead peptide inhibitor cyc-LHSPW was tested against a panel of cancer-associated proteases with wide-ranging substrate specificities (Fig. 5A) . APN was the only protease inhibited by cyc-LHSPW with chymotrypsin, trypsin, PSA, KLK7, aminopeptidase A, and the exopeptidase FAP all having K i values above 100 μM. Having assessed selectivity for purified 

EPKVA >500 APN, we next evaluated the ability of cyc-LHSPW to preferentially bind to cells that express surface APN using flow cytometry (Fig. 5B) . For flow cytometry, we synthesized a fluorophore-containing version of the peptide possessing a (Gly) 4 -FITC group coupled to the C-terminal cysteine (Supplemental Figure 4) . The expression of cell surface-associated APN was examined in the androgen receptor negative neuroendocrine prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145 using a commercially available antibody. The cell line PC3 was found to express surface-associated APN, whereas no detectable expression was found for the DU145 cell line by this method. When incubated with both cells lines, the FITC labeled cyc-LHSPW peptide preferentially bound to PC3 cells with no noticeable labelling of DU145 cells. The peptide was next tested on frozen PC3 and DU145 tumor xenografts sections. Preferential labeling of the PC3 xenograft section was evident, furthering attesting to the specificity of cyc-LHSPW by fluorescence microscopy. The potential therapeutic efficacy of cyc-LHSPW was next tested in vitro using the PC3 and DU145 cell lines. The APN inhibitor demonstrated a specific and pronounced therapeutic benefit resulting in the decreased clonal survival of PC3 cells. No significant biological effect was observed on either cell line after treatment with the hydrolyzable LHSPW peptide or the cyc-nHSPW derivative. Prior to in vivo therapeutic efficacy studies, a toxicity study was performed with the i.v. administration of cyc-LHSPW. We found that a single high dose of 100 mg/ kg was well tolerated by the mice; however, multiple doses at this concentration, as would be needed, resulted in cachexia. It was found that a dose of 40 mg/kg administered three time a week for four weeks (t.i.w. x4) was well tolerated, i.e. no signs of morbidity. Mice bearing established PC3 and DU145 xenografts were treated systemically via tail vein injection with 40 mg/kg of the tumor homing APN peptide cyc-NGR or the cyc-LHSPW peptide t.i.w. x4 (Fig. 6B) . Inhibition of tumor growth in the PC3 xenograft mice treated with cyc-LHSPW was significant (P < 0.05) three weeks into the trial when compared to the saline-and cyc-NGR-treated arms. This therapeutic effect persisted to the end of the study with the cyc-LHSPW-treated mice having a tumor volume of 309.3 ± 92.7 mm 3 at day 35. Little therapeutic effect was observed in the cyc-NGR-treated mice with both the saline-and cyc-NGR-treated arms having tumor volumes >1000 mm 3 at the end of the study. PC3 tumors were removed and stained for the cellular proliferation marker Ki67. Both the saline-and cyc-NGR-treated tumors had profoundly higher populations of K i 67 positive cells compared to the cyc-LHSPW-treated tumors (Fig. 6C) . No therapeutic effect observed in the APN-negative DU145 tumors treated with either cyc-LHSPW or cyc-NGR.

The proteases responsible for the increased proteolysis associated with aggressive forms of cancer represent candidate therapeutic targets. The over-expression of APN on the surface and neo-vasculature of solid tumors has made it the most studied member of the M1 family of metalloproteases and the most targeted. A number of groups have developed molecules targeting APN ranging from monoclonal antibodies to synthetic peptidomimetic inhibitors of its enzymatic activity [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Perhaps the most well-known for APN is the cyclic tumor-homing peptide asparagine-glycine-arginine (cyc-NGR) originally discovered through in vivo peptide phage display 25 . This peptide has been radiolabeled for nuclear imaging and has been used to deliver therapeutic peptides and proteins in vivo to APN-expressing tissues [26] [27] [28] . The NGR motif mimics the structure of extracellular matrix proteins that APN is known to bind but not degrade. There are a number of drawbacks associated with the use of the cyc-NGR peptide, foremost among them is deamidation of the asparagine residue 25 . This spontaneous reaction, enhanced when the asparagine is adjacent to a glycine residue, results in the formation of isoaspartate-glycine-arginine (isoDGR) which is a ligand capable of binding to α V β 3 integrin and several other integrins with lower affinity. This deamidation can lead to decreased specificity and potential off target affects 29 . Additionally, as further demonstrated by our study, the cyclic-NGR peptide alone is not therapeutic, rather it is only therapeutic when conjugated to toxins. Thus, there is a great need for low-molecular weight APN-targeted therapeutics that are stable and specific.

The development of targeted agents for APN has been greatly hindered by two factors -the incomplete understanding of APN substrate specificity and, until recently, the paucity of high-resolution atomic structures. Here, we have presented the most comprehensive examination of the substrate specificity of APN to date and detailed the key structural interactions that dictate this specificity. By understanding the molecular architecture of APN at the atomic level and investing its specificity with our global profiling technique, we were able to rationally design peptide inhibitors of its enzymatic activity. The S1 pocket of APN has hydrophobic walls with an open end resulting from the presence of Met349, Phe467 and Tyr472. As predicted from the S1 architecture, the P1 specificity of APN favored hydrophobic residues. Amino acids with large positively charged side chains (such as arginine and lysine) are also tolerated as substrates because their side chains can form hydrophobic and polar interactions with aforementioned residues in the S1 pocket. In contrast, acidic residues (glutamic acid and aspartic acid) and short-branched residues (such as asparagine and proline) are strongly disfavored in the P1 position due to charge and VDW repulsion, respectively.

The active site of APN is expansive with openings on three sides allowing for the accommodation of large peptide substrates. Its exclusive mono-aminopeptidase activity is the direct result of hydrogen bonds formed between active site residues Gln208, Glu350 and Glu406 with the N-terminal amine group of the peptide substrate. Di-aminopeptidase activity is not observed because favorable hydrogen bonds cannot be made to anchor the peptide in the proper orientation for bond hydrolysis. The importance of these hydrogen bonds in peptide binding was also evident in our inhibitor study in which the N-termini of HSPW peptides were capped with different groups. By removing one or more potential hydrogen bonds from the N-terminus, the capped peptides were unable to bind, resulting in poor inhibition. In addition to these P1 residues, our global analysis revealed previously uncharacterized prime-side specificity features that were dictated by hydrophobic interactions in addition to hydrogen bonding with main chain groups. These important interactions were evident when the HSPW core sequence of our lead inhibitor was truncated. The removal of Trp5 or both Pro4 and Trp5 abrogated the ability of the peptide to inhibit APN. The critical interactions these two residues make with the active site were observed in our modelling experiment documenting that both residues form VDW interactions with Y472. The end result of our study was a cyclic peptide, cyc-LHSPW that was a potent and specific inhibitor of APN. By inhibiting the enzymatic activity of APN, we found that cyc-LHSPW was therapeutic both in vitro and in vivo in a model of highly aggressive neuroendocrine prostate cancer. With this aggressive form of cancer on the rise, it is highly plausible the future treatments for neuroendocrine prostate cancer could involve targeting APN 30 .

Our investigation into the substrate specificity of APN underscored the utility of the MSP-MS assay over conventional techniques for determining aminopeptidase specificity. A number of limitations exist when using single-amino acid chromogenic or fluorogenic substrates to determine aminopeptidase specificity with P1′ reporter groups, as an example, potentially altering the P1 specificity profile. In addition to reporting on prime-side specificity, our global approach also allowed for the identification of individual synthetic peptides that are bona fide substrates and served as a template for APN inhibitor design. APN has emerged as important pericellular protease target in aggressive cancer. We envision that the substrate specificity preferences identified here will both guide the development of next-generation APN-targeted therapeutics as well as aid in the discovery of its endogenous substrates to further expand our knowledge of its role in biology.

APN expression and purification. Porcine APN ectodomain (residues 62-963) and human APN ecdomain (residues 66-967) were expressed and purified as previously described 31 . Briefly, APN ectodomains containing N-terminal honeybee-melittin signal peptide and C-terminal His 6 tag were expressed in insect cells, secreted to cell culture medium, and purified sequentially on Ni-NTA column and gel-filtration column.

MSP-MS assays were carried out as described previously 16 . Briefly, 0.2 µg/mL recombinant human APN from R&D Systems (catalog #: 3815-ZN-010) and matched no-enzyme control were assayed against a diverse library of 228 tetradecapeptides pooled at 500 nM in D-PBS (pH 7.4) containing 1 mM TCEP. After 1, 15, 60, 240, and 1200 min, 30 µL of assay mixture was removed, quenched with 7.5 µL 20% formic acid, and flash-frozen in liquid N 2 . Prior to mass spectrometry acquisition, peptide samples were desalted using C 18 desalting tips and rehydrated in 0.2% formic acid. LC-MS/ MS data were acquired using a Thermo Scientific LTQ-FT mass spectrometer, which was equipped with a Thermo Scientific EASY-Spray Ion Source, EASY-Spray PepMap C 18 Column (3 µM, 100 Å), and Waters nanoACQUITY UPLC System.

Peptide peak lists were generated using MSConvert from the ProteoWizard Toolkit 32 , and data were searched against the 228-member peptide library using Protein Prospector software (v.5.17.0, University of California, San Francisco) 33 . Protein Prospector score thresholds were selected with a minimum protein score of 15 and minimum peptide score of 10. Maximum expectation values of 0.01 and 0.05 were used for protein and peptide matches, respectively. Substrate specificity profiles were generated with iceLogo software 18 using all possible cleavages in the MSP-MS library (n = 2,964) as the negative data set as described 16 . MS1 extracted ion chromatograms for label-free quantitation of select substrate and product species were generated using Skyline software (v.3.5, University of Washington) 34 . Specificity constants (k cat /K m ) were calculated as described 16 . All raw spectrum (.RAW) files from MSP-MS experiments in this study are available at the ProteoSafe resource (ftp:// MSV000080171@massive.ucsd.edu/; username MSV000080171, password: hAPN).

Porcine APN ectodomain was crystallized as previously described 35 . Briefly, pAPN at 10 mg/mL concentration in buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH7.2 and 200 mM NaCl was crystallized by itself and then amino acid was soaked into the pAPN crystal. Crystallization of pAPN was set up with 1 µL protein solution and 1 µL well solution containing 18% PEG3350, 200 mM Li 2 SO4, and 100 mM HEPES pH7.2 mixed together in sitting drops. Crystals of pAPN were grown at 4 °C for two weeks, and were then transferred to amino acid-soaking solution containing 5 mM amino acid, 20% ethylene glycol, 25% PEG3350, 200 mM Li 2 SO4, and 100 mM HEPES pH7.2 for another two days. The crystals were flash frozen in liquid N2 and used for data collection. Data were collected at APS beamline 24-ID and ALS beamline 4.2.2. X-ray diffraction data were processed using HKL2000 36 . The structures of pAPN complexed different amino acids were determined by directly refining the model of the unliganded pAPN structure (PDB 4FKE) against the amino acid-soaked crystal data. Programs CNS 37 and CCP4 refmac 38 were used for structure refinement. Program COOT was used for model building and structural superposition 39 .

The six amino acids were soaked into pAPN crystals to determine the structures of the pAPN/amino acid complexes. The structure of the unliganded pAPN was used to determine the structures of amino acid-soaked pAPN. Objective Fo-Fc omit maps were calculated in the absence of amino acids and showed strong electron density for each of the amino acids (Supplemental Figure 4) . Based on these maps, the models of amino acids were built, and the models of pAPN/amino acid complexes were further refined. Crystallographic statistics can be found in Supplemental Figure 5 .

Peptide synthesis and inhibitor testing. The peptides used in this study were custom synthesized by AAPPTEC of Louisville, KY using traditional Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis 40 . All of the peptides were purified and characterized by AAPPTEC. The peptides used in all of the studies were greater than >95% purity as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Inhibition assays were performed in triplicate in a 100 mM Tris pH 7.2, Brij 35 0.0002% w/v assay buffer at 37 °C with 0.1 μM APN and 100 μM H-Ala-AMC (fluorophore). Values were recorded by Infinite pro plate reader every 2 minutes for 30 minutes with laser parameters set for excitation at 355 nm and emission at 460 nm. As the inhibition of APN was competitive, the values for the inhibition constant, K i , were determined from the IC50 using the Cheng-Prusoff equation: K i = IC 50 /(1 + [S]/ Km).

Flow cytometry and microscopy. DU145 and PC3 cells were washed with PBS and harvested mechanically with a cell scraper. A total of 1 × 10 6 cells were incubated with 500 nmol/L cyc-LHSPW-(Gly) 4 -FITC or anti-CD13 antibody (22A5-FITC, Miltenyi) for 60 minutes at 4 °C. Stained samples and controls were assayed on a BD Facscalibur. Tumor sections frozen in OCT medium were sectioned at a thickness of 7 μm and briefly fixed in cold acetone for 10 min. After rinsing in PBS, the sections were stained with 250 nM cyc-LHSPW-(Gly) 4 -FITC overnight at 4 °C. The sections were washed with PBS and mounted with DAPI Prolong Gold. The slides were visualized using a Nikon 6D High Throughput Epifluorescence Microscope.

In vitro and in vivo therapeutic studies. The clonogenic survival assays were conducted as previously described 41 . Mouse care and treatment was approved by and performed in accordance with the guidelines of the University of Minnesota Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Cells maintained under standard conditions were detached by treatment with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution and washed in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS). They were then suspended in a 60% mixture of Matrigel Matrix (BD Biosciences) in HBSS at a concentration of 1.0 × 10 6 cells per 100 μL of solution. The cells were then injected into the subcutis overlying the rear flanks of 6-week-old male nude mice (Harlan). Once the tumors were established, the animals were randomized into three treatment groups per xenograft. The both cyc-LHSPW and cyc-NGR were dissolved in DMSO and diluted in sterile PBS to a final DMSO concentration of 5% v/v. The mice were then dosed via tail vein injection with 40 mg/kg of the cyclic peptides or saline at days three times a week for four weeks total. Tumor measurements were made twice weekly with calipers and the tumor volume (in mm 3 ) was calculated by the formula 0.5236 × length (L) × width (W) × height (H). The endpoint of the study was either five weeks after the first treatment dose or when the tumors reached a volume of 1,000 mm 3 as dictated by our animal protocol. PC3 tumors were removed from euthanized animals, formalin fixed and stained for Ki67 using the manufacturer's protocol.

Statistical analysis. Data were analyzed using the unpaired, two-tailed Student t test. Differences at the 95% confidence level (P < 0.05) were considered to be statistically significant.

The Neonatal Fc Receptor (FcRn) Enhances Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) Transcytosis across Epithelial Cells

The mechanisms by which human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) crosses mucosal surfaces to establish infection are unknown. Acidic genital secretions of HIV-1-infected women contain HIV-1 likely coated by antibody. We found that the combination of acidic pH and Env-specific IgG, including that from cervicovaginal and seminal fluids of HIV-1-infected individuals, augmented transcytosis across epithelial cells as much as 20-fold compared with Env-specific IgG at neutral pH or non-specific IgG at either pH. Enhanced transcytosis was observed with clinical HIV-1 isolates, including transmitted/ founder strains, and was eliminated in Fc neonatal receptor (FcRn)-knockdown epithelial cells. Non-neutralizing antibodies allowed similar or less transcytosis than neutralizing antibodies. However, the ratio of total:infectious virus was higher for neutralizing antibodies, indicating that they allowed transcytosis while blocking infectivity of transcytosed virus. Immunocytochemistry revealed abundant FcRn expression in columnar epithelia lining the human endocervix and penile urethra. Acidity and Env-specific IgG enhance transcytosis of virus across epithelial cells via FcRn and could facilitate translocation of virus to susceptible target cells following sexual exposure.

Sexual transmission of HIV-1 requires that virus establish infection across genital tract or intestinal tissue. Sexually transmitted infections, other causes of inflammation, and localized trauma may allow susceptible CD4+ target cells at skin or mucosal surfaces to become directly exposed to secretions from infected sexual partners [1, 2] . However, when skin and mucosa are intact, it remains unclear precisely how HIV-1 gains access to target cells. One possibility is that virus translocates between epithelial cells until susceptible cells are found either in or below the epithelium [3] . Alternatively, Langerhans cells may sample the surface, acquire virus, and move it to areas of abundant target cells [4, 5] . Finally, transcytosis of HIV-1 (i.e., movement through cells) has been studied as a potential mechanism to translocate virus from mucosal surfaces to deeperlying CD4+ cells [6, 7, 8] .

Transcytosis offers an explanation for movement of virus across epithelial cells forming tight junctions, which might normally exclude pathogens from moving beyond the surface. However, in vitro, only a very small amount of virus, usually less than 0.3% of a cell-free virus inoculum, finds its way through cells into the medium bathing basolateral surfaces ( [9] ). Interactions between HIV-1 Env and several host cell surface molecules, including glycolipids, heparan sulfate proteoglycans and gp340, have been proposed to play a role in transcytosis [10, 11, 12, 13, 14] .

With the exception of the acute phase prior to development of anti-HIV-1 immune responses, semen, cervicovaginal, and rectal fluids from HIV-1-infected individuals contain antibodies against HIV-1 Env [15, 16, 17] . The concentration of Env-specific IgG present in such secretions varies considerably from person to person and is usually on the order of 100 to 1,000-fold less than concentrations found in plasma [18] . The presence of Env-specific IgG strongly suggests that some proportion of Env molecules on the surface of infectious virions in genital tract secretions is coated with IgG. Since HIV-1 is successfully transmitted sexually, the coating antibody is either of insufficient quantity or quality to neutralize virus infectivity upon contact with an uninfected partner.

Antibody in genital tract secretions of HIV-1-infected individuals could play a role in facilitating the transport of virus across mucosal epithelia. Such a role is made particularly plausible by the reported expression of the Fc neonatal receptor (FcRn) in human genital mucosal tissue [19] . FcRn is a heterodimeric receptor belonging to the MHC class I family of proteins [20, 21] . The expression of FcRn in endothelial cells is thought to be critical for IgG homeostasis in blood [22] , and its expression in placental syncytiotrophoblasts is a key factor in transporting maternal IgG to the fetal circulation [23] . A characteristic of FcRn is its ability to bind the Fc region of IgG at acidic pH and to release it at neutral pH [24] . This pH-dependent binding allows the transport of intact IgG or of IgG immune complexes from luminal surfaces bathed in acidic fluids, for example, cervicovaginal secretions, to basolateral surfaces exposed to a neutral intracellular milieu [19] .

Cervicovaginal secretions are maintained at acidic pH by acidproducing bacteria that make up part of the normal vaginal microbiota [25] . Although perturbations of normal microbiota, such as occur with bacterial vaginosis, raise the pH, the secretions generally remain in the acidic range [26, 27] . Semen rapidly neutralizes cervicovaginal secretions, but the extent of the pH change is variable. For example, a large amount of ejaculate may raise the pH to the neutral range, whereas a small amount may not [28, 29] . The pH of rectal secretions ranges from about 6.8 to 7.2 [30] .

Given that HIV-1 in genital tract secretions may be complexed with IgG antibody, that female genital tract secretions are acidic, and that FcRn has been demonstrated in genital tract tissues, we evaluated the role of pH and antibody on transcytosis of HIV-1 through polarized epithelial cells.

Acidic pH and Env-specific IgG enhance transcytosis of HIV-1

To investigate the effect of low pH and antibody on HIV-1 transcytosis across epithelial cells forming tight junctions, we exposed the apical surface of HEC-1A cells to HIV-1 at pH 6.0 or 7.4 with or without HIV-1-specific IgG (HIVIG). Virus was quantified in the medium bathing the basolateral cell surface (''subnatant fluid'') by RT-PCR and, although detectable as early as six hours after exposure of virus to the apical cell surface, the quantity was greater at 12 hours ( Figure S1 ) [8] . Thus, in subsequent experiments, transcytosis was measured at 12 hours. Using HIV-1 US712 , a clade B R5 clinical isolate, HIVIG enhanced transcytosis in a dose-dependent manner when virus and antibody were exposed to the apical surface at pH 6.0 ( Figure 1A) . There was no increase in transcytosis with HIVIG at pH 7.4 or with HIV-negative IgG (IVIG) at pH 6.0 or 7.4. We found similarly enhanced transcytosis using additional R5 as well as X4 and X4/ R5 strains ( Figure 1B) . Importantly, transcytosis of four of five clade C transmitted/founder Env-pseudotyped viruses was enhanced in a pH and antibody-dependent manner ( Figure 1C ). Enhanced transcytosis with HIV-1-specific antibody at low pH also occurred with T84 colon carcinoma cells ( Figure S2 ).

Since sexual transmission may occur with small amounts of virus, we investigated if pH-and antibody-dependent enhancement of transcytosis could occur at very low HIV-1 inocula. Using HIVIG or the anti-gp41 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2F5, we found that transcytosis occurred with virus inocula as low as 2 pg of p24 (about 60,000 RNA copies) with HIVIG and 0.02 pg of p24 (about 500 RNA copies) with 2F5, amounts too small to be detectable in subnatant fluid in the absence of low pH and HIV-1specific antibody ( Table 1) . These quantities of virus are within the range observed in seminal and cervicovaginal fluids of HIVinfected individuals [31, 32, 33] .

The impact of both antibody and low pH suggested FcRn involvement [34, 35] . We knocked down FcRn in HEC-1A cells, verifying lower expression by flow cytometry and by Western blot ( Figure S3A ). The knock-down HEC-1A cells attained the same level of electrical resistance as did the wild-type cells (data not shown), indicating that FcRn knockdown did not affect the ability to form tight junctions. Unlike with wild-type HEC-1A cells, there was no enhanced transcytosis with FcRn-knockdown HEC-1A cells when either mAb 2F5 (Figure 2A ) or polyclonal HIVIG (data not shown) were used. We also evaluated Fc mutants of the HIV-1 Env-specific mAb b12. A mutant designed to abrogate FcRn binding (I253A), markedly lowered transcytosis compared with wild-type b12 ( Figure 2B ) [36] . The second mutant (M428L), designed to bind with higher affinity to FcRn, increased transcytosis compared with wild-type b12 ( Figure 2B ) [37] . Binding to HIV-1 JRFL gp120 ( Figure S3B ) and neutralization of HIV-1 JRFL ( Figure S3C ) were nearly equivalent for the wild-type and Fc mutant versions of b12, indicating that the Fc mutations did not affect Fab-antigen binding. Blockade of FcRn with

HIV-1 causes a sexually transmitted disease. However, the mechanisms employed by the virus to cross genital tract tissue and establish infection are uncertain. Since cervicovaginal fluid is acidic and HIV-1 in cervicovaginal fluid is likely coated with antibodies, we explored the effect of low pH and HIV-1-specific antibodies on transcytosis, the movement of HIV-1 across tight-junctioned epithelial cells. We found that the combination of HIV-1-specific antibodies and low pH enhanced transcytosis as much as 20-fold. Virus that underwent transcytosis under these conditions was infectious, and infectivity was highly influenced by whether or not the antibody neutralized the virus. We observed enhanced transcytosis using antibody from cervicovaginal and seminal fluids and using transmitted/ founder strains of HIV-1. We also found that the enhanced transcytosis was due to the Fc neonatal receptor (FcRn), which binds immune complexes at acidic pH and releases them at neutral pH. Finally, staining of human tissue revealed abundant FcRn expression on columnar epithelial cells of penile urethra and endocervix. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism wherein HIV-1 may facilitate its own transmission by usurping the antibody response directed against itself. These results have important implications for HIV vaccine development and for understanding the earliest events in HIV transmission.

anti-FcRn antibody and inhibition of endosomal acidification by bafilomycin A1 also substantially reduced or eliminated enhanced transcytosis ( Figure S3D -F), as did competition between the non-HIV-1-specific mAb Den3 and the anti-HIV-1 Env mAb VRC01 ( Figure S3G ). Consistent with other investigations of Fc-FcRn interactions, maximally enhanced transcytosis occurred at pH 5.5-6.0, with some enhanced transcytosis apparent at pH 4.5 and 6.5 ( Figure S3H ) [38, 39] . Since FcRn binds to IgG and not to IgA, we compared two different IgG1 mAbs, b12 and HGN194, with their IgA class-switched versions. Both IgG1 mAbs enhanced transcytosis of HIV-1 JRFL pseudoviruses and SHIV 1157ipEL-p at pH 6.0, whereas the IgA class-switched versions did not ( Figure 2C and 2D). In fact, as reported, dimeric IgA1 HGN194 inhibited transcytosis [40] . Thus, enhanced transcytosis at low pH in the presence of specific antibody is mediated by IgG and is dependent on FcRn.

Using 50 mg/ml of VRC01 or Den3, transcytosis of IgG alone increased approximately 3 fold from about 0.4% at pH 7.4 to about 1.3% at pH 6.0 ( Figure S4) . However, the effect of FcRnmediated transcytosis on IgG alone does not appear as strong as the effect on IgG immune complexes, where, for example, with complexes made with 50 mg/ml of VRC01 or 2F5, there was about an 8-fold increase in transcytosis under conditions allowing FcRn engagement. This difference may be due to the contribution of fluid phase uptake of IgG by the epithelial cells at both pH 6.0 and pH 7.4; IgG thus internalized can engage FcRn in acidic endosomes and be shuttled to the basolateral side of the cells [41] . The internalization of immune complexes, on the other hand, likely depends primarily on FcRn engagement at the surface of the cell at pH 6.0.

We evaluated the ability of HIVIG and a panel of mAbs with variable neutralizing activities to mediate pH-dependent transcytosis with fully infectious HIV-1 JRFL ; 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 s) of the antibodies ranged from 0.06 to .50 mg/ml (Fig. 3E ). Both poorly neutralizing antibodies (HIVIG and mAbs b6 and F240; Figure 3A ) and neutralizing mAbs (4E10, 2F5, 2G12, VRC01, and b12; Figure 3B ) enhanced transcytosis at pH 6.0. At 50 mg/ml, transcytosis correlated directly with mAb binding to HIV-1 JRFL (Spearman rho = 0.75; p = 0.052) and inversely with the IC 50 of the mAbs (Spearman rho = 20.71; p = 0.050) ( Figure S5 ). At pH 6.0, all Env-specific mAbs and HIVIG mediated transcytosis of virus that infected TZM-bl cells ( Figure 3C and D). However, there was a strong correlation between the amount of transcytosed infectious virus and the neutralizing activity (IC 50 ) of the antibody that mediated the transcytosis (Spearman's rho = 0.86; p = 0.001). Virus whose transcytosis was mediated by poorly neutralizing antibodies HIVIG, F240 and b6, at least at concentrations of 100 and 50 mg/ml, was more infectious than virus which crossed the epithelial cells in a non-FcRn-dependent manner (i.e., in the presence of Den3 control mAb) (Fig. 3C) . Conversely, transcytosis mediated by antibodies with the lowest IC 50 s, such as VRC01 and b12, resulted in less infectious virus than was observed with the Den3 control antibody ( Figure 3D ). Thus, strong binding activity results in more FcRn-dependent transcytosis, whereas strong neutralizing activity renders the transcytosed virus less infectious.

This point is further illustrated by the ratio of percenttranscytosed:percent-infectious virus ( Figure 3E ). For example, for every infectious unit, about 30 times more virus is transcytosed with VRC01 than with HIVIG ( Figure 3E ). Note that independently of transcytosis, HIV-1 JRLF infectivity on TZM-bl cells increased about 3.5-fold after incubation of virus for 12 hours at pH 6.0 compared with pH 7.4; however, IC 50s were very similar (,15% difference) at the two pH values (pH comparisons done for 2F5 and VRC01 only; data not shown). Virus infectivity was essentially abrogated after a 12-hour incubation at pH 4.0 (data not shown).

IgG from genital tract secretions enhances transcytosis at pH 6.0

We next determined whether IgG purified from cervicovaginal fluid and from seminal fluid could enhance transcytosis at low pH. Using IgG from cervicovaginal fluid of three HIV-infected women and from seminal fluid of three infected men, enhanced transcytosis occurred at IgG concentrations well within their expected range in genital tract secretions ( Figure 4A and 4B) [18] . The ability of genital tract IgG to mediate transcytosis correlated strongly with infectious virus capture activity by the IgG (Spearman's rho = 0.94, p = 0.005; Figure 4C ) and less so with binding to monomeric Env glycoprotein from the same virus strain (HIV-1 US657 ) (rho = 0.65, p = 0.16; Figure S6 ). None of the genital tract IgGs were able to neutralize HIV US657 , the clinical R5 strain used in these experiments, at IgG concentrations as high as 50 mg/ ml (not shown). Consistent with HIVIG and the non-neutralizing mAbs, higher concentrations of genital tract IgGs generally resulted in greater infectivity of the transcytosed virus ( Figure 4D and 4E).

FcRn expression was previously reported in human uterine and vaginal epithelial cells [19] . Using immunohistochemistry to survey FcRn protein expression at various sites in the human genital tract, we detected abundant FcRn expression in columnar epithelial cells lining the human penile urethra (Figure 5A and 5D; Figure S7A and S7D) and endocervix ( Figure 5B and 5E; Figure S7B and S7E). In contrast, little to no FcRn protein was observed in vaginal/ectocervical squamous epithelia, and expression occurred only in the basal epithelial layer ( Figure 5C and 5F; Figure S7C) . A similar staining pattern was observed in foreskin tissue (data not shown).

Female genital tract secretions are often acidic, and the secretions of HIV-infected individuals have antibody capable of coating virus contained in those secretions. These facts led us to explore the role of antibody and low pH on transcytosis of HIV-1 across epithelial cells. Our primary finding is that at acidic pH, IgG enhances transcytosis of HIV-1 clinical isolates, including transmitted/founder Env-pseudotyped strains. Moreover, antibody from both cervicovaginal and seminal fluid mediates enhanced transcytosis at low pH. The enhanced transcytosis is abrogated by blocking or knocking down FcRn, which is known to bind IgG and immune complexes at low pH and release them at neutral pH [24, 42] . We also establish that virus translocated across epithelial cells after incubation with antibody at low pH remains infectious. Although neutralizing antibodies generally promote more transcytosis, the transcytosed virus is relatively less infectious than virus whose transcytosis is mediated by non-neutralizing antibodies. Finally, we demonstrate abundant FcRn protein expression in columnar epithelial cells of the human endocervix and penile urethra, suggesting that these sites could play a major role in FcRn-mediated immune complex transcytosis.

Our results indicate that FcRn may be responsible for shuttling IgG-bound HIV-1 across epithelial cells in the genital tract. This is consistent with other studies that have highlighted a role for FcRn in immune complex shuttling across tissues [34, 35, 43] . Mice expressing human FcRn in intestinal epithelial cells were able to deliver IgG to the luminal intestinal surface, which could then bind to its cognate antigen and return the immune complex back to the lamina propria for presentation by dendritic cells to CD4+ T cells [34] . In addition, cytomegalovirus (CMV) applied to human placental explants from women with high anti-CMV neutralizing antibody activity was rapidly transcytosed across syncytiotrophoblasts and captured by villus macrophages [35] . Under these conditions, the virus did not replicate. However, in explants from CMV-seropositive women with low or undetectable neutralizing antibodies, virus replication readily occurred in cytotrophoblasts underlying an intact, uninfected syncytiotrophoblast layer. Thus, it appeared that neutralizing antibody inhibited infection after allowing virus to cross the syncytiotrophoblast layer. On the other hand, non-neutralizing antibody allowed or even promoted infection. Syncytiotrophoblasts express high levels of FcRn, and when FcRn on explants was blocked, IgG-virion complexes were not transported across the surface [35] . Just as we found with HIV-1, FcRn-mediated transcytosis of CMV occurred with both neutralizing and poorly neutralizing antibody, but transcytosed virus remained infectious only when complexed with poorly neutralizing antibody. Finally, immunohistochemical staining of placentas from in utero infections were consistent with this model of FcRn-mediated transcytosis [35] .

To our knowledge, ours is the first study to investigate transcytosis using virus coated with HIV-specific antibody in an acidic environment that mimics that of the female genital tract. Our in vitro observations are applicable to male-to-female transmission via vaginal intercourse, where enhanced transcytosis could facilitate infection. In this regard, Li et al. reported FcRn expression and bidirectional IgG transport in a human vaginal tissue model [19] . Although we did not detect FcRn in the apical layers of vaginal epithelium, we did detect abundant FcRn expression in columnar endocervical epithelial cells. These cells may be exposed to acidic vaginal secretions where they occur at the cervical os. Furthermore, cervical ectopy, a common condition characterized by the extension of endocervical columnar epithelium into the ectocervix and upper vagina, has been implicated as a risk factor for HIV-1 infection [44, 45] . Prevalent in reproductive-age women, these cervical lesions are exposed to vaginal pH conditions and could provide portals for FcRn-mediated male-to-female HIV-1 transmission [46] . FcRn was also found, though not consistently, in basal epithelial cells of the vagina. These cells lie deep in the epithelium and are unlikely to come in contact with acidic secretions and HIV-1 immune complexes unless there were trauma or substantial thinning of the overlying squamous epithelium. It is important to note that seminal fluid can rapidly raise the pH of cervicovaginal secretions to levels which would not support immune complex-FcRn binding. However, the pH of cervicovaginal fluid following ejaculation is dependent on the quantity of the ejaculate and may stay within an acidic range [29] . Furthermore, HIV is present in preejaculate secretions and could be introduced into the female genital tract prior to ejaculation [47] .

With respect to female-to-male transmission, the penis comes in contact with vaginal secretions that would remain at acidic pH at least until ejaculation, allowing time for exposure of penile tissues, including the foreskin and urethra, to IgG-coated virus at low pH [28, 29] . Our demonstration of abundant FcRn on human penile urethral epithelium supports a model where exposure to antibodybound HIV-1 might lead to enhanced female-to-male transmission. It should be noted that the pH of vaginal secretions is typically about 4, which is below the pH required for Fc-FcRn binding [48] . However, there is substantial variability in normal vaginal pH [26, 48] , and we did begin to observe enhanced transcytosis at pH 4.5 ( Figure S3H ). Furthermore, it is possible that there is some buffering effect of foreskin and urethral secretions. The foreskin, whose presence increases HIV infection rate, could trap secretions containing HIV-1 immune complexes and thereby allow greater urethral exposure to infected material within the pH range of Fc-FcRn binding [49] . Additionally, bacterial vaginosis, a condition associated with an increased risk of female-to-male (as well as male-female) HIV transmission, results in vaginal secretions ideal for Fc-FcRn binding [26, 27, 50] . Exposure of penile tissues to the pH range of Fc-FcRn binding may also occur after ejaculation, since complete neutralization of vaginal acidity may not occur immediately or at all [29] . It is also possible, though less likely, that FcRn mediates HIV transmission via the penis during insertive anal intercourse, where the penis may come into contact with slightly acidic rectal secretions [30] .

The finding that IgG from cervicovaginal and seminal fluids obtained from HIV-infected individuals mediate enhanced transcytosis of infectious virus further suggests the biological relevance of our results. Cervicovaginal and seminal fluids are reported to contain an average of ,3 mg/ml and up to ,15 mg/ ml of Env-specific IgG [18] . Four of the six samples we evaluated bound to infectious HIV-1 at 5 mg/ml. Moreover, all of our samples mediated transcytosis at #12.5 mg/ml of total IgG, well below total IgG concentrations found in genital secretions of HIVinfected men and women [18] . Even during acute HIV infection, when the risk of transmission to an uninfected partner is highest, 23 of 23 subjects (100%) were reported to have anti-gp41 IgG antibodies and 40% had anti-gp120 IgG antibodies in cervicovaginal and seminal fluids [17] . Anti-gp41 IgG levels were on average 11-fold higher than gp41-specific IgA levels; anti-gp41 IgM was found less frequently and in lower quantity. Thus, HIV-1 immune complexes are likely to occur in mucosal secretions, are likely to contain predominantly IgG, and under acidic conditions, would be subject to FcRn-mediated transcytosis in an exposed host.

The relevance of our findings is also supported by our demonstration that transcytosis of transmitted/founder strains of HIV-1 Env pseudotyped virus is enhanced by antibody. We are currently evaluating whether transmitted/founder strains, in comparison with chronic strains, are preferentially transcytosed, which would be consistent with a report showing a higher sensitivity of clade B transmitted/founder strains to anti-Env antibody binding [51] .

Our findings represent a new model of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of HIV-1 infection. Previous studies have demonstrated ADE in vitro due to FccR-or complement-mediated mechanisms or to modulation of the interaction of gp120 with CCR5 [52, 53, 54] . Here we demonstrate that enhancement in vitro occurs at the level of transcytosis across epithelial cells and involves FcRn. In vivo, Ig isotype, as well as neutralizing activity, are likely to play a determining role in whether an antibody might protect from or enhance infection. As demonstrated recently, intrarectally applied dIgA1 HGN194 mAb, but less so the IgG1 version, prevented SHIV infection following intrarectal challenge [40] . In vitro, the dIgA1 inhibited transcytosis, whereas we now show that the IgG1 version enhances transcytosis at pH 6.0. Another study showed that, compared to irrelevant-and no-antibody controls, there was an increase in the number of transmitted/founder SHIV variants when vaginal challenge followed systemic or local infusion of a non-neutralizing IgG1 mAb [55] . Clearly, other studies have found that IgG with neutralizing activity can prevent lentivirus infection after vaginal challenge [56, 57] . Thus, whereas a strong vaccine-induced neutralizing IgG response may protect, nonneutralizing IgG or waning titers of neutralizing IgG present in an acidic lumen might enhance transcytosis across mucosal barriers while allowing infection of susceptible target cells. However, whether an antibody protects, enhances or has no effect is likely to depend on the potency and breadth of antiviral activity, the viral strain, the inflammatory state of the exposed individual, and genetic factors-such as FccR polymorphisms-that might influence antibody function [58] . Finally, if FcRn-mediated transcytosis applies in vivo, our results would strengthen the argument for a mucosal IgA response to vaccination-though not at the exclusion of a strong IgG neutralizing or other anti-viral response-since IgA can inhibit transcytosis, would not engage FcRn, and mediates only uni-directional translocation of immune complexes from the subepithelial space into external secretions [40, 59] .

Some studies have reported that anti-HIV-1 Env IgG antibodies can inhibit transcytosis [9, 60, 61] . One of these studies found that polyclonal anti-HIV Env IgG inhibited transcytosis of cell-free virus on HEC-1 cells, whereas none of 13 mAbs did; in fact, some of the mAbs might have increased transcytosis, although by no more than about 50% [61] . To our knowledge, none of these studies was carried out under the acidic conditions that characterize female genital tract secretions.

Our results suggest that FcRn might facilitate infection in hosts without pre-existing antibody or with a non-neutralizing IgG response to prior infection (which would result in secondary infection) or to vaccination. However, FcRn could also play a beneficial role in preventing infection after exposure. FcRn mediates the bidirectional transcytosis of IgG, and in immunized individuals, could provide a conduit for antibodies to neutralize virus as shown for herpes simplex virus type 2 [19] . In addition, IgG immune complexes can prime CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in an FcRn-dependent manner, and FcRn targeting may be a useful mucosal immunization strategy [62, 63, 64] .

In summary, we have demonstrated that FcRn mediates enhanced transcytosis of HIV-1 in the presence of low pH and HIV-1-specific antibody. We have also shown that FcRn is present on epithelial cells in areas of the genital tract that are potentially exposed to HIV-1 during sexual intercourse. Our findings point toward a novel mechanism by which the sexual transmission of HIV-1 may be facilitated.

This research was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the University of California, Irvine, Boston University, and the University of Alabama, Birmingham. Subjects from whom specimens were collected for study purposes provided written informed consent. Antibodies HIVIG (IgG derived from pooled plasma of HIV-infected individuals) and IgG1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 2F5, 4E10, 2G12, F240, b6, and VRC01 were obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagents Program. IVIG (Gamunex, Taleris Biotherapeutics) was commercially acquired. mAb b12 and control mAb Den3 were provided by Dennis Burton and Brian Moldt, and control mAb Fm-6 was a gift of Wayne Marasco (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute); b12 and the control mAbs are IgG1. Generation and purification of dimeric and monomeric IgA2 versions of b12 (dIgA2 b12 and mIgA2 b12) are described elsewhere [66] . Briefly, the IgG constant region in pDR.12 (IgG b12) was replaced with the constant region of IgA2. IgA2 b12 was expressed in CHO-K1 cells with human J chain and purified by Protein L affinity matrix (Pierce). mIgA b12 and dIgA b12 were isolated by size exclusion chromatography. IgG1 HGN194 (a human mAb against HIV-1 Env V3), dIgA1 HGN194, and dIgA2HGN194 were provided by Davide Corti and Antonio Lanzavecchia [67] . HGN194 variants were constructed as follows: human J chain precursor (accession number NP_653247), IgA1 (allele IGHA1*01, accession number J00220) and IgA2 (allele IGHA2*01, accession number J00221) constant region nucleotide sequences were codon optimized and synthesized by Genscript. Constant regions were cloned into a mammalian expression vector used for subcloning of the HGN194 VH region. The HGN194 VH and VL chain were codon optimized and synthesized by Genscript and cloned into an IgG1 and Ig-lambda expression vector. MAbs HGN194 dIgA1, dIgA2, and IgG1 were produced by transient transfection of 293 freestyle cells with polyethylenimine and expression plasmids encoding corresponding heavy and light chains (in the case of dIgA1 and dIgA2, the J chain expression plasmid was included). Supernatant fluid from transfected cells was collected after 7-10 days of culture. HGN194 dIgA1, dIgA2, and IgG1 were affinity purified by Peptide M (dIgA1 and dIgA2) or Protein A (IgG1) chromatography. Purified Abs were quantified by ELISA using dIgA1 and dIgA2 or IgG1-specific Abs (Southern Biotech). Purity and polymeric state of dIgA1 and dIgA2 were confirmed by native-PAGE analysis and gel filtration chromatography. The presence of dIgA1 and dIgA2 associated J-chain was confirmed by Western blot from native and SDS-PAGE gels. Sera from 20 Zambian clade C-infected subjects (obtained from Zdenek Hel, University of Alabama, Birmingham) were pooled for IgG isolation using the Pierce Melon Gel IgG Spin Purification Kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Env-specific IgG, determined as for CVL and seminal fluid (see below), was 0.98% of total IgG. Sera from five uninfected individuals were pooled and processed for IgG isolation in the same manner.

Fc mutants designed to enhance (M428L) or reduce (I253A) mAb b12 binding to FcRn were constructed as follows: briefly, the b12 variable regions were PCR-amplified from pDR12 and cloned into the pc1HC and pkLC vectors [68, 69] . Amino acid substitutions were introduced by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Constructs were verified by sequence analysis before transiently expressed in FreeStyle 293 cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and purified by protein A affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare, United Kingdom).

Antibodies were tested for neutralizing activity against indicated HIV-1 strains using TZM-bl cells.

Half-area 96-well plates (Corning) were coated with 5 mg/ml (250 ng/well) of goat anti-human Fc antibody and incubated over night at 4uC. Plates were then washed with PBS and blocked with 4% non-fat dry milk for 1 hour at room temperature (RT). After washing, capture antibodies were added at 5 mg/ml (250 ng/well), and plates were incubated an additional hour at RT. Next, virus was added to washed plates (20 ng p24/well) and incubated for 3 hours at 37uC. Unbound virus was removed by washing with PBS. Subsequently, 1610 4 TZM-bl cells/well were added in the presence of 10 mg/ml DEAE dextran and incubated for 48 hours at 37uC. Cells were then washed, lysed, and developed with luciferase assay reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Luminescence (relative light units) was measured using a Synergy 2 microplate luminometer (BioTek).

We measured binding of antibodies either to virus directly coated on ELISA-plate wells or to solubilized Env. For the direct virus binding assay, plates were coated with HIV-1 JR-FL (20 ng p24/well) for 2 hours at 37uC, washed with PBS and blocked with 4% non-fat dry milk in PBS. After 1 hour at 37uC, plates were washed, antibodies were added in serial dilutions and incubated for 1 hour at 37uC. Detector antibody (horse radish peroxidaselabeled goat anti-human Fc) was added to the washed plate and incubated for 45 min at 37uC. Finally, plates were washed, developed (TMB solution, Life Technologies), and read at 450 nm using a plate reader (BioTek).

The soluble Env binding assay was performed as previously described with some modifications [70] . Briefly, wells were coated with 250 ng of a gp120 Env specific anti-C5-antibody (D7324 [Aalto Bioscience]), washed and blocked with 4% non-fat dry milk. Serial dilutions of detergent-solubilized HIV-1 JR-FL (starting at 150 ng p24) was added and incubated for 2 hours at 37uC. Plates were then incubated with a constant concentration of antibodies (1 mg/mL) for 1 hour at 37uC followed by detection and development steps as described above.

Five R5 clade C transmitted/founder Env pseudotyped strains were constructed as described [71, 72] . Briefly, rev-vpu-env cassettes from the transmitted founder strains were cloned into pcDNA 3.1D/V5-HIS TOPOH expression vector. The pseudotyped viruses were then produced by co-transfecting 293T cells with pcDNA 3.1(rev-vpu-env), pNL4-3.lucR-E-, and fugene 6 (Roche).

Cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) and seminal fluid were collected from HIV-1-infected patients and healthy volunteers at the University of Alabama, Birmingham. All subjects gave written consent in accordance with an IRB-approved protocol. CVL was collected from one 34 year-old uninfected women and from three infected women (age 29 to 46 years) with CD4+ lymphocyte counts of 458/mm 3 , 181/mm 3 and 498/mm 3 and plasma viral loads of 14100 copies/ml, 824 copies/ml and 88 copies/ml, respectively. Viral loads were not measured in the CVL fluid specimens. Two of the women (with the lower plasma viral loads) were receiving anti-retroviral therapy. Briefly, CVL fluid was obtained by flushing the cervix and vagina with 5 ml sterile saline, and the wash was collected into tubes with protease inhibitors ( [73] ). Seminal fluid was obtained from two uninfected men (ages 25 and 40 years), and from three infected men (age 43 to 53 years) by masturbation (58) . CD4 counts in the infected men were 404/ mm 3 , 336/mm 3 and 407/mm 3 and plasma viral loads were ,100 copies/ml, 8092 copies/ml and 6750 copies/ml, respectively; only one of these subjects (with viral load of 11 copies/ml) was receiving anti-retroviral therapy. Seminal fluid was assayed for HIV-1 RNA by PCR, but none was detected. The cervicovaginal and seminal fluids were centrifuged and supernatant fluids aliquoted and frozen at 280uC until assayed. Total IgG was determined by ELISA [74] . IgG isolation was accomplished by incubating samples with Protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.) followed by elution of bound IgG according to manufacturer's instructions. The IgG preparations were concentrated and dialyzed against DPBS using Amicon Centrifugal Filter Units (Millipore Corp.). The IgG preparations from the two uninfected men were pooled to obtain sufficient quantity for experiments; all other IgG preparations were tested individually.

Env-specific IgG binding levels in seminal and CVL fluids were quantified by ELISA. Detergent-solubilized Env from HIV-1 US657 was captured by a polyclonal sheep anti-gp120 antibody (D7324, Aalto Bio Reagents Ltd). Sample IgG and an anti-gp120 mAb standard (b6) were serially diluted, added to wells, washed, and detected by anti-human IgG (gamma)-HRP (Sigma-Aldrich, A6029) antibody. Plates were subsequently developed, stopped, and read at OD 450 nm. The concentrations of Env-specific IgG in the seminal and CVL IgG samples were calculated using the mAb b6 standard and are reported as a percent of total IgG in each sample.

Anti-Env IgG ranged from 0.9 to 2.6% of total IgG in the seminal fluid specimens and from 0.1 to 0.6% of total IgG in the CVL fluids specimens ( Figure S6 ).

Transcytosis assays were conducted using reproductive tractderived (human endometrial carcinoma [HEC-1A]) or intestinal tract-derived (human colonic carcinoma [T84]) cells. HEC1-1A or T84 cell monolayers were created on 0.4 mm polyethylene terephthalate membrane hanging transwell inserts (Millipore). Cell viability was .95% at the time of plating. Electrical resistance across the membrane, which ranged from 400-450 mOhms/cm 2 at the start of the transcytosis assay, confirmed monolayer integrity. Resistance was re-measured after the transcytosis assay in more than 50% of wells and ranged from 450-480 mOhms/ cm 2 . HIV-1 alone or with antibody was added to monolayers in media buffered to pH 6.0 or 7.4. After 12 hours, fluid in the lower chamber (''subnatant fluid''), maintained at pH 7.4, was collected and used to measure viral RNA copy number and infectivity. In the absence of cell monolayers, about 69% of the virus inoculum was present in the lower chamber of the wells after 12 hours. FcRn knockdown of HEC-1A cells HEC-1A cells were transduced with FcRn shRNA Lentiviral Particles (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) following manufacturer's protocol. Cells were selected in medium containing 5 mg/ml Puromycin dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich Inc.), and FcRn expression was verified by flow cytometry using rabbit polyclonal anti-FcRn antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), normal rabbit IgG (negative control) and FITC-goat anti-rabbit IgG F(ab9)2 secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.) ( Figure S3A ). Cytofix/Cytoperm Plus Kits (BD Biosciences) were used to fix, permeabilize and stain cells. Knockdown of FcRn was also confirmed by western blot using rabbit anti-FcRn antibody (Novus Biologicals) ( Figure S3A ). Wild-type and knockdown cells had similar viability. Neither wildtype nor knockdown HEC-1A cells stained for FccRIIa or FccRIIIa (not shown).

HEC-1A cells were incubated with 50 mg/ml rabbit polyclonal anti-FcRn IgG (H-274; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) or normal rabbit polyclonal IgG for 1 hour at pH 7.4 before exposing the apical surface to HIV-1 US712 and HIVIG, b12, IVIG or Synagis. Similarly, HEC-1A cells were incubated with 0.1 mM bafilomycin A1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) for 1 hour prior to HIV-1 and antibody exposure. Transcytosis was then carried out as above.

Cervical tissue, which included portions of endocervix and upper vagina (ectocervix), was obtained from 10 women aged 31-50 undergoing hysterectomy for nonmalignant conditions. Vaginal tissue was also obtained from women undergoing vaginal repair (n = 6, aged 44-78 years). Penile tissue, including urethra (n = 16) and foreskin (n = 2), was harvested at autopsy from 16 men aged 34-73 with no history of hormonal or immunosuppressive medications. Tissues were processed within 60 minutes of surgical removal. Samples were either embedded in Tissue-Tek Optimal Cutting Temperature Compound (Sakura Finetek U.S.A., Inc.) and rapidly frozen and stored at 270uC (frozen sections) or were fixed in formaldehyde and processed for paraffin embedding.

The alkaline phosphatase immunohistology technique was described previously ( [75] ). Two anti-FcRn antibodies were used: 1) Anti-FcRn antibody purified from rabbit serum raised against a2 (88-177aa) and a3 (1782-247aa) domains of human FcRn (provided by Neil Simister, Brandeis University) for use on frozen sections ( Figure 5) , and 2) rabbit anti-FcRn antibody obtained from Novus Biologicals for use on paraffin sections following citrate buffer (pH 6.0) antigen retrieval ( Figure S7 ). Sections were blocked with serum-free protein solution, and optimally diluted primary FcRn antibodies or rabbit IgG (negative control) were added and incubated for 1-2 hours at RT. Binding of antibodies to FcRn in tissues was visualized using an alkaline phosphatase detection system that stains positive cells bright red. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and cover-slipped using aqueous mounting medium.

Differences in amounts of transcytosed or infectious virus between conditions were compared using Kruskal-Wallis or repeated-measures ANCOVA. For repeated-measures ANCOVA, the percentage of transcytosed or infectious virus was logittransformed and normality evaluated using the Shapiro-Wilk test.

Correlations between continuous variables were evaluated by Spearman's rho. Two-tailed p-values are reported. Figure S1 Transcytosis of HIV-1 at pH 6.0 over time. HIV-1 JRFL with HIVIG, IVIG or no antibody was applied to the apical surface of HEC-1A cells at pH 6.0. At the indicated times, subnatant fluid (pH 7.4) was collected, and transcytosis was quantified by RT-PCR. 

Biological Crystallography Structural basis of sialidase in complex with geranylated flavonoids as potent natural inhibitors

Sialidase catalyzes the removal of a terminal sialic acid from glycoconjugates and plays a pivotal role in nutrition, cellular interactions and pathogenesis mediating various infectious diseases including cholera, influenza and sepsis. An array of antiviral sialidase agents have been developed and are commercially available, such as zanamivir and oseltamivir for treating influenza. However, the development of bacterial sialidase inhibitors has been much less successful. Here, natural polyphenolic geranylated flavonoids which show significant inhibitory effects against Cp-NanI, a sialidase from Clostridium perfringens, are reported. This bacterium causes various gastrointestinal diseases. The crystal structure of the Cp-NanI catalytic domain in complex with the best inhibitor, diplacone, is also presented. This structure explains how diplacone generates a stable enzyme-inhibitor complex. These results provide a structural framework for understanding the interaction between sialidase and natural flavonoids, which are promising scaffolds on which to discover new anti-sialidase agents.

Viral and bacterial sialidases have been focused on as drug targets for the treatment of human infections (Soong et al., 2006; Memoli et al., 2008) . Viral sialidases are critically required for viral propagation because they are required for release from the host cell . Drug discovery of inhibitors targeting sialidase has focused on either synthetic compounds through random screening or substrate (N-acetylneuraminic acid) mimics. However, these studies have mainly been targeted against sialidase from the influenza virus. There are several inhibitors that mimic the substrate, including zanamivir (Relenza), oseltamivir (Tamiflu; a cyclohexene derivative), peramivir (a cyclopentane-based inhibitor) and A-315675 (a pyrrolidine-based inhibitor; Kim et al., 2013) . All of these compounds are based on 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-Nacetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac2en), a putative transitionstate analogue. At present, the existence of drug-resistant strains against zanamivir (Gubareva et al., 1998) , oseltamivir (Gubareva et al., 2001) and other antivirals (Tambić Andrasević, 2004) have spurred on the need to discover innovative antiviral agents.

On the other hand, pathogenic bacteria having resistance to pre-existing drugs occasionally cause fatal infectious diseases. The need to combat these superbugs mandates the development of new drugs overcoming antibacterial resistance. Various pathogens such as Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae express sialidases. These enzymes specifically catalyze the hydrolysis of terminal sialic acids from glycoconjugates (Shinya et al., 2006) and play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of a number of microbial diseases, including cholera, enterotoxaemia, gas gangrene and pneumonia (Corfield, 1992; Rood, 1998) . Therefore, bacterial sialidases have recently emerged as a prominent target for the treatment of bacterial infections (Nguyen et al., 2010; Woo et al., 2011) . The latest studies on sequelae of sepsis and septic shock have focused on understanding the roles of bacterial pathogenic factors (Rittirsch et al., 2008) . Moreover, studies using a sialidase deletion mutant from P. aeruginosa showed that bacterial sialidase acts in the initial stages of pulmonary infection by targeting glycoconjugates and biofilm production (Soong et al., 2006) .

Since sialidase inhibitors are substrate analogues and typically exhibit competitive kinetics, it is interesting to explore natural non-substrate mimics such as flavonoids, (oligo)stilbenes, coumarins and diarylheptanoids (Grienke et al., 2012) . Flavonoids, which are polyphenolic compounds, are widespread in the plant kingdom and are known to show antibacterial and antiviral effects (Liu et al., 2008; Jeong et al., 2009; Grienke et al., 2012) . Natural flavonoids have also been reported to have latent anti-influenza and antibacterial effects against SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus, MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) and Chagas disease mediated by a trypanosome (Arioka et al., 2010; Cho et al., 2013; Navrá tilová et al., 2013) .

Recently, we identified the natural geranylated flavonoids diplacone, mimulone, 3 0 -O-methyldiplacone and 4 0 -Omethyldiplacone from the fruit of Paulownia tomentosa (empress tree) and showed that they are potent inhibitors of both cholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase . Here, we report that geranylated flavonoids are novel inhibitors targeting bacterial sialidase. These compounds show striking competitive inhibitory effects against sialidase from C. perfringens (Cp-NanI). Importantly, C. perfringens is a human pathogen causing various gastrointestinal diseases such as enterotoxaemia, gas gangrene and peritonitis.

In spite of reports of a number of structures of sialidases from bacteria (Crennell et al., 1993 (Crennell et al., , 1994 Gaskell et al., 1995) , viruses (Varghese et al., 1983; Burmeister et al., 1993; Crennell et al., 2000) and humans (Chavas et al., 2005) , elucidation of the binding mode of bacterial sialidase inhibitors is limited owing to the absence of structural information (Taylor, 1996) . In order to understand how natural geranylated flavonoids interact with sialidase, we determined the crystal structure of the Cp-NanI catalytic domain (NanI CD ; residues 243-694) in complex with diplacone at 1.9 Å resolution. The structural information on Cp-NanI CD and comparison with the models of human sialidases provide an insight into how the natural geranylated flavonoids can behave as antibiotics and led to the elucidation of a strategy for the design of advanced inhibitors for the treatment of infectious diseases caused by C. perfringens.

The DNA template for C. perfringens sialidase (Cp-NanI) has NCBI reference sequence WP_011590331.1. For bacterial expression, the NanI catalytic domain without the lectin domain (NanI CD ; residues 243-694) was amplified from C. perfringens genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites of the pET-23d expression vector (Novagen), which contains a direct C-terminal hexahistidine (His 6 ) tag. Cp-NanI CD protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 CodonPlus (DE3) cells. The transformed cells were cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 100 mg ml À1 ampicillin at 310 K. The bacterial cells were induced at 293 K for 20 h with 0.5 mM isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (Pharmacia) at an OD 600 of 0.6 and then harvested by centrifugation at 4000g for 20 min. The harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 1 mM PMSF, 2 mM -mercaptoethanol) and lysed by sonication, after which the lysate was centrifuged at 14 000g for 1 h. The resultant supernatant was applied to an immobilized metal-affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Peptron) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole). The column was then washed with ten bed volumes of wash buffer. The His 6 -tag fused protein bound to the column was eluted with elution buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole). The samples were then purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare Life Science) preequilibrated with gel-filtration buffer (25 mM CHES-HCl pH 9.5, 200 mM NaCl), after which the fractions containing Cp-NanI CD protein were collected. The protein was concentrated to 21.8 mg ml À1 using an Amicon Ultra-15 30K (Millipore) and was stored at 193 K.

Crystallization trials were performed using the hangingdrop vapour-diffusion method. Crystals grew at 293 K in 2 ml drops comprised of equal volumes of protein solution and reservoir solution consisting of 20%(w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate. The crystals were soaked in soaking solution [0.1 M sodium cacodylate pH 6.5, 20%(w/v) PEG 3350, 10%(w/v) glycerol, 5 mM diplacone, 5%(v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide] for 2 h at 293 K. The crystals were cryoprotected by transfer into cryoprotectant [20%(w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 10%(v/v) glycerol, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate] and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen for data collection. A complete data set for Cp-NanI CD with diplacone at 1.9 Å resolution was collected at 100 K using an ADSC Q315r detector on beamline 5C at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) using an X-ray beam with a single wavelength (0.9795 Å ). The crystal belonged to space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 , with unit-cell parameters a = 69.1, b = 72.6, c = 97.1 Å . Diffraction data were processed and scaled using the HKL-2000 suite research papers (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997) . The structure of Cp-NanI CD with diplacone was determined using the molecular-replacement method with MOLREP (Vagin & Teplyakov, 2010) in the CCP4 suite using the apo crystal structure of Cp-NanI CD (PDB entry 2vk5; Newstead et al., 2008 ) as the phasing model. Automated model building and refinement of NanI CD complexed with diplacone were performed with REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 2011) in the CCP4 suite and phenix.refine (Adams et al., 2010) . phenix. ligandfit (Terwilliger et al., 2006) was used for automated ligand building of the diplacone in Cp-NanI CD , and manual model building was performed with Coot (Emsley & Cowtan, 2004) . Weak electron-density regions (residues 692-694) were excluded from the final structure. The Ramachandran statistics were calculated using MolProbity (Chen et al., 2010) . 96.2% of the residues were in the preferred regions and 3.8% of the residues were in allowed regions. A 2F o À F c composite OMIT map of diplacone contoured at 1.0 was generated with FFT (Read & Schierbeek, 1988) in the CCP4 suite. The atomic coordinates and structure factors of Cp-NanI CD with diplacone have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession code 4l2e. Data-collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1 .

The extraction and purification of the natural geranylated flavonoids diplacone, mimulone, 3 0 -O-methyldiplacone and 4 0 -O-methyldiplacone from P. tomentosa (empress tree) were performed as described previously .

The sialidase inhibitory assay was performed as reported previously Cho et al., 2013) . Briefly, 15 ml GH33 sialidase solution (0.1 U ml À1 ) was pre-mixed with 15 ml sample solution at different concentrations in 510 ml 50 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5.0 in a cuvette. 60 ml 0.125 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl--d-N-acetylneuraminic acid sodium salt hydrate (Sigma, catalogue No. M8639) in buffer at pH 5.0 was then added to the mixture as a substrate to start the reaction at 310 K. 4-Methylumbelliferone was immediately quantified by fluorometric determination with a SpectraMax M 2e Multimode Reader (Molecular Devices, USA). The excitation wavelength was 365 nm and the emission wavelength was 450 nm. Enzyme activity was recorded over a range of pre-incubation times (Fig. 1a) or concentrations (Fig. 1b) . The data were analyzed using a nonlinear regression program (SigmaPlot; SPCC Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). The experimental enzyme activity was determined using the logistic curve represented by (1), based on a time-driven protocol with initial velocity,

Model structures of human sialidases (Neu1, Neu3 and Neu4) were built using the MODELLER 9v7 software (Sali & Blundell, 1993) . Human Neu1-4 protein sequences were retrieved from NCBI database (Neu1, NM_000434.2; Neu2, NM_005383.2; Neu3, NM_006656.5; Neu4, NM_001167599.1). On the basis of the Neu2 sequence and structure (PDB entry 1vcu; Chavas et al., 2005) , multiple sequence alignment and structure-based alignment were performed using ClustalX2 (Larkin et al., 2007) and MODELLER 9v7 align2d (Sali & Blundell, 1993 ; Supplementary Fig. S1 1 ) . Regions from Neu1, Neu3 and Neu4 that are not conserved in the Neu2 catalytic domain (Neu1 residues 1-64, Neu3 residues 1-11, 287-300 and 315-326 and Neu4 residues 1-10, 284-336 and 355-373) were excluded. Modelling was carried out for the human Neu1, Neu3 and Neu4 catalytic domains against the chosen Neu2 template (PDB entry 1vcu) using MODELLER 9v7 modelsingle (Sali & Blundell, 1993; Supplementary Fig. S2 ). Each of ten outputs of the modelled structures was ranked using an internal scoring function in MODELLER 9v7. The reliability of the homology modelling was assessed by calculating the root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s. is the intensity of reflection hkl, P hkl is the sum over all reflections and P i is the sum over i measurements of reflection hkl. ‡ R work = P hkl jF obs j À jF calc j = P hkl jF obs j|; R free is the R value calculated for 5% of the data set that was not included in the refinement.

In order to demonstrate that flavonoid-based natural compounds extracted from P. tomentosa act as inhibitors of Cp-NanI, a comparative activity screen was performed. This method relies on substrate hydrolysis, leading to an increase in fluorescence that can be read out in real time. Interestingly, a geranyl (3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dienyl) group at the C6 position within the flavonoid was found to be crucial for both inhibi-tory potency and kinetic mechanism. For example, diplacone showed a 150-fold higher efficacy (IC 50 = 0.11 mM) than eriodictyol, a parent flavonoid lacking a geranyl group (IC 50 = 16.4 mM) ( Table 2) . As shown in Fig. 1 , diplacone showed competitive kinetics, with a K i value of 0.04 mM. Diplacone also acted as a time-dependent inhibitor.

Slow-binding inhibition mechanisms can be investigated by pre-incubation of the enzyme with the inhibitor followed by measurement of the initial velocities of substrate hydrolysis as a function of pre-incubation time. In this way, increasing the concentration of diplacone led to a decrease in both the initial velocity (v i ) and the steady-state rate (v s ) (Figs. 1a, 1b and Supplementary Fig. S3a ). The progress curves obtained using various concentrations of the inhibitors were fitted to equation (2) (Supplementary Fig. S3a) to determine v i , v s and k obs . The results for diplacone were fitted to the a slow-binding process (equation 3; Supplementary Fig. S3a) dependence of k obs on the concentration of bacterial sialidase (Fig. 1c) . Based on the above kinetic observations, we conclude that the reaction follows a time-dependent kinetic mechanism (Fig. 1d) . From the results of the fit, values of 0.201 AE 0.003 and 0.0017 AE 0.004 min À1 were obtained for k 5 and k 6 , respectively. Using these values derived from k obs gives a calculated K i app value of 0.065 AE 0.008 mM, which is in agreement with the K i (0.04 mM) value determined using double-reciprocal plots (Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon plots; Supplementary Fig. S4 ). The hyperbolic dependence observed with the inhibitors suggests that diplacone inhibits sialidase by the rapid formation of an enzyme complex (EÁI) which slowly isomerizes to form a modified enzyme complex (E Ã ÁI) ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S3b ).

Comparison of the structures of sialidases from bacteria (Crennell et al., 1993 (Crennell et al., , 1994 Gaskell et al., 1995) , viruses (Varghese et al., 1983; Burmeister et al., 1993; Crennell et al., 2000) and humans (Chavas et al., 2005) suggested that sialidases share a highly conserved active site located within the six-bladed -propeller fold (Supplementary Table  S3 and Supplementary Fig. S5 ). To investigate the mode of binding of diplacone to the enzyme, we determined the structure of Cp-NanI in complex with diplacone. The structure of Cp-NanI CD in complex with diplacone shows little deviation from previously published structures. The -propeller fold within the apo structure (PDB entry 2vk5; Newstead et al., 2008) and the structure of Cp-NanI in complex with the substrate Neu5Ac (N-acetylneuraminic acid; PDB entry 2bf6; Newstead et al., 2008) show root-meansquare deviations (r.m.s.d.s) relative to our structure of 0.12 and 0.11 Å , respectively (Figs. 2a and 3a) . Consistent with our kinetic analysis, diplacone was bound to the enzyme active site. The principal interactions between the inhibitor and enzyme were hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The 3 0 ,4 0 ,5,7 0 -hydroxyl-4-oxo group and the O atom at the 1-position of diplacone form direct or indirect hydrogen bonds with side chains of the tri-arginyl cluster (Arg266, Arg555 and Arg615) as well as residues Arg285, Asp328, Phe353, Tyr485, Gln493, Thr538, Tyr655 and the main chain of Ala292, in addition to three water molecules (W1, W2 and W3) ( Fig. 2b and Supplementary  Fig. S6 ). The flavanone backbone of diplacone also displays hydrophobic contacts with Ile327, Phe347, Phe460, Tyr485 and Tyr655, which orientate the inhibitor correctly and stabilize the bound conformation.

The crystal structure also provides an explanation for the weak inhibition shown by the parent eriodictyol and three other geranylated flavonoids (3 0 -O-methyldiplacone, 4 0 -Omethyldiplacone and mimulone) studied in this manuscript (Table 2; Fig. 2b ). The geranyl group made a suitable hydrophobic interaction with four aromatic residues: Phe353, Trp354, Phe460 and Tyr587. Therefore Table 2 Structures and inhibitory activities (IC 50 ) of flavonoid-based Cp-NanI inhibitors. of Ala292 and the side chains of Ile327 and Phe347. On the other hand, eliminating the C3 0 hydroxyl group (mimulone, IC 50 of 6.1 mM) does not lead to structural clashes with the protein but prevents hydrogen-bond formation. Therefore, maintaining the geranyl and C3 0 hydroxyl group is important for the further development of diplacone-based Cp-NanI inhibitors.

Although the overall structure of Cp-NanI CD in complex with diplacone is similar to those of the apo enzyme and the complex with Neu5Ac, there are interesting structural differences between the apo enzyme and the complexes with Neu5Ac and diplacone that provide useful information regarding the development of natural geranylated flavonoid-based synthetic inhibitors (Fig. 3b) . Asp291 in the diplacone and Neu5Ac complexes, which is a mechanistically important acid/base catalyst (Crennell et al., 1993) , rotates by approximately 120 compared with the apo structure to make a hydrogen bond to the 3 0 -hydroxyl of diplacone or the 4 0 -hydroxyl of Neu5Ac. Moreover, the rotation of Asp291 also induces a conformational change of Ile327 in the apo enzyme compared with both complexes. Relative to the diplaconebound complex, in the Neu5Ac-bound complex Ile327 moves to make a suitable hydrophobic interaction with the -carbon of Asp291 and the 5 0 -acetamide moiety of the Neu5Ac molecule. Apo Cp-NanI CD and the diplacone complex showed a hydrogen-bond interaction mediated by one water molecule (W1), the position of which nearly overlaps with the 4 0 -hydroxyl group of Neu5Ac. On the other hand, the hydrogen bond between Asp328 and the 4 0 -hydroxyl group of The Cp-NanI catalytic site with diplacone. (a) Overall structure of the Cp-NanI catalytic domain bound to diplacone.

Diplacone and Neu5Ac molecules are displayed as green and cyan sticks, respectively. Water molecules (W1, W2 and W3) are shown as red spheres.

Neu5Ac seems to be responsible for inducing the conformational change of Ile327. Cp-NanI CD in complex with diplacone has the same side-chain orientation of Asp291 as in the substrate (Neu5Ac) complex. In addition, an extra water molecule (W1) rather than the 4 0 -hydroxyl group of Neu5Ac stabilizes the diplacone complex. Therefore, together with the kinetic inhibition assay, the structure of the Cp-NanI CDdiplacone complex suggests that diplacone binds to the same substrate-binding site and acts as a competitive inhibitor.

We have extracted natural geranylated flavonoids from P. tomentosa and shown that they exhibit notable kinetic properties against sialidase from C. perfringens, a bacterium causing various gastrointestinal diseases. We also found that diplacone is the most effective inhibitor among these flavonoids. This inhibitor also shows a time-dependent competitive inhibition pattern. The crystal structure of the Cp-NanI catalytic domain in complex with diplacone rationalized how the geranyl and C3 0 hydroxyl groups of diplacone contribute to the stability of the enzyme-inhibitor complex (Table 2) . From the structural information described above, we suggest further modification strategies of diplacone to improve its inhibitory properties against C. perfringens NanI. In the Cp-NanI-diplacone complex, two water molecules (W1 and W2) mediate hydrogen bonds between Cp-NanI residues (Arg285 and Asp328 with W1 and Gln493, Thr538 and Tyr587 with W2) of the catalytic site and diplacone atoms (O1 with W1 and C4 with W2) ( Table 2 and Fig. 2b) . Introducing polar moieties such as carboxylic and amino groups at the O1 or C4 positions of diplacone may possibly improve binding affinity in the Cp-NanI catalytic site through the formation of additional hydrogen bonds. Addition of hydrophobic groups, including phenyl, benzyl and cyclohexyl groups, to C3 of diplacone may also increase the binding affinity via hydrophobic contact with the hydrophobic patch (Phe353, Trp354 and Phe460) of the enzyme. Furthermore, aryl groups (phenyl or benzyl) may form a potential dipole-dipole interaction with Phe353.

Because sialidases are expressed not only in C. perfringens but also in human lysosomes (Neu1 and Neu4), cytosol (Neu2) and membranes (Neu3), diplacone could cause undesirable effects in humans because it may inhibit human sialidases. To predict how diplacone would interact with human silalidase counterparts, we modelled human sialidases (Neu1, Neu3 and Neu4) using the previously determined Neu2 structure and compared the specificity of diplacone with C. perfringens and human sialidases ( Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. S2 ). The Cp-NanI catalytic domain with bound diplacone was superimposed with the crystal structure of human Neu2 with bound 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and models of human Neu1, Neu3 and Neu4 that were constructed using Neu2 as a template. The geranyl group of diplacone is essential for inhibition of the bacterial enzyme as it occupies a hydrophobic pocket containing Phe353, Thr487 and Tyr587. In human Neu proteins the corresponding residues are polar and would not interact favourably with the geranyl group (Fig. 4b) .

Consequently, the structural comparison between the human sialidases Neu1-Neu4 and the Cp-NanI-diplacone complex suggests that the interaction between human sialidases and diplacone is likely to be unfavourable owing to polar or ionic repulsion.

On the other hand, despite extensive efforts in drug development targeting influenza neuraminidase, a series of drug-resistant mutants from influenza viruses have been reported, such as the I223R/H275Y dual mutation of neuraminidase from influenza A H1N1, which shows enormous resistance towards oseltamivir (approximately 7500 times that of the wild type; van der Vries et al., 2012) . To overcome drug resistance, various natural flavonoid compounds containing a Structural comparison of Cp-NanI CD , the human Neu2-Neu5Ac2en complex structure and homology models of human Neu1, Neu3 and Neu4.

flavanone backbone with inhibitory effects on viral neuraminidases (Grienke et al., 2012) may be useful. Because diplacone has a flavanone backbone, structural information on the Cp-NanI-diplacone complex would help in the discovery of viral neuraminidase inhibitors. In this light, we compared the structure of the Cp-NanI CD -diplacone complex with two structures of drug-resistant mutants of viral neuraminidases (the I223R mutant of H1N1 and the H274Y mutant of H5N1) to examine the use of diplacone against influenza viral neuraminidases. Despite the low sequence identity and low homology of viral neuraminidases from influenza A (IA-NA) and B (IB-NA) with Cp-NanI CD (identity: IA-NA, 11.56%; IB-NA, 12.55%; homology: IA-NA, 29.15%; IB-NA, 29.53%), their overall structures are well conserved (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S7a). Moreover, diplacone seems to be accessible regardless of the I223R or the H275Y mutation. The hydroxyl group at the C4 position of diplacone is able to interact with Glu276 of the H275Y mutant as in the wild type, which suggests that diplacone may be a potential lead compound for the development of inhibitors of drug-resistant mutants of viral neuraminidases ( Supplementary Fig. S7b ).

In summary, we isolated the geranylated flavonoids diplacone, mimulone and 4 0 -O-methyldiplacone from P. tomentosa and showed their inhibitory activities against Cp-NanI using comparative activity screening. The first crystal structure of sialidase with a geranylated flavonoid provides structural insights into the binding mode of natural flavonoid-based inhibitors at atomic resolution. The higher inhibitory potency of diplacone relative to the other compounds studied here can be ascribed to two principal factors. Firstly, the 3 0 -hydroxyl group stabilizes the enzyme-inhibitor complex through hydrogen bonding to the main chain of Ala292. Secondly, additional hydrophobic interactions are observed between the geranyl group and the hydrophobic pocket formed by Phe353, Trp354 and Tyr587 in the active site. Importantly, in the four variants of human sialidase this pocket has a significantly different polarity and would not be expected to interact favorably with the geranyl group. Glu111, Tyr179 and Tyr181 of human Neu2 are not conserved in bacterial and viral sialidases and are considered as important sites for the design of selective drugs targeting bacteria and viruses (Burmeister et al., 1993) . However, our biochemical and structural data suggest that the hydrophobic binding pocket of Cp-NanI which binds the geranyl group within diplacone may also be exploited as a means to derive selectivity for bacterial versus human sialidases. Our results will provide valuable information for the design of new selective antibacterial or antiviral agents using flavonoids.

Rapid Evolution of PARP Genes Suggests a Broad Role for ADP-Ribosylation in Host-Virus Conflicts

Post-translational protein modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitinylation are common molecular targets of conflict between viruses and their hosts. However, the role of other post-translational modifications, such as ADPribosylation, in host-virus interactions is less well characterized. ADP-ribosylation is carried out by proteins encoded by the PARP (also called ARTD) gene family. The majority of the 17 human PARP genes are poorly characterized. However, one PARP protein, PARP13/ZAP, has broad antiviral activity and has evolved under positive (diversifying) selection in primates. Such evolution is typical of domains that are locked in antagonistic 'arms races' with viral factors. To identify additional PARP genes that may be involved in host-virus interactions, we performed evolutionary analyses on all primate PARP genes to search for signatures of rapid evolution. Contrary to expectations that most PARP genes are involved in 'housekeeping' functions, we found that nearly one-third of PARP genes are evolving under strong recurrent positive selection. We identified a .300 amino acid disordered region of PARP4, a component of cytoplasmic vault structures, to be rapidly evolving in several mammalian lineages, suggesting this region serves as an important host-pathogen specificity interface. We also found positive selection of PARP9, 14 and 15, the only three human genes that contain both PARP domains and macrodomains. Macrodomains uniquely recognize, and in some cases can reverse, protein mono-ADP-ribosylation, and we observed strong signatures of recurrent positive selection throughout the macro-PARP macrodomains. Furthermore, PARP14 and PARP15 have undergone repeated rounds of gene birth and loss during vertebrate evolution, consistent with recurrent gene innovation. Together with previous studies that implicated several PARPs in immunity, as well as those that demonstrated a role for virally encoded macrodomains in host immune evasion, our evolutionary analyses suggest that addition, recognition and removal of ADP-ribosylation is a critical, underappreciated currency in host-virus conflicts.

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins regulate a wide variety of cellular processes, including several aspects of innate immunity against pathogens. As a result, pathogens have evolved mechanisms to block, reverse or usurp this machinery in order to successfully replicate within their hosts [1] . For example, numerous viruses subvert the dynamics of phosphorylation, employing kinases, substrate mimics and phosphatases to disrupt host signaling [1] . Likewise, addition and removal of acetyl groups by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylases (HDACs) can have a dramatic effect on viruses such as HIV, herpesviruses, polyomaviruses and papillomaviruses. In response, several viral classes encode proteins to specifically disrupt host phosphorylation and acetylation [2] . Beyond small-molecule PTMs, conjugation and cleavage of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like molecules has emerged as an important point of cellular regulation that several viruses target or subvert in order to replicate [3] .

In contrast, ADP-ribosylation is still poorly characterized for its role in innate immunity, despite being one of the first identified PTMs. Transfer of ADP-ribose (ADPr) from NAD + (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) to proteins is catalyzed within eukaryotic cells by members of the PARP (poly-ADP-ribose polymerase), or ARTD (ADP-ribosyltransferase, diphtheria toxin-like) protein family ( Figure 1A ) [4, 5] . The best-studied PARPs, including the founding member PARP1, catalyze the formation of long, branched chains of ADP-ribose known as poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) [4, 6, 7, 8] . These PAR-forming enzymes perform critical housekeeping functions, such as nucleation of DNA-damage foci (PARP1 and 2) and proper chromosome segregation during mitosis (PARP5a) [7, 8] . In contrast to these well-described functions, most human PARP proteins are poorly understood, in part due to their lack of conservation in model organisms such as C. elegans and D. melanogaster [4, 9, 10] . In total, 17 genes in the human genome contain PARP domains, with each gene containing a variety of other functional domains that likely endow each PARP with their individual functions ( Figure 1A ) [4, 10] . Many of the poorly-characterized human PARP proteins are found in the cytoplasm [11] and are predicted to only catalyze addition of a single ADPr, rather than PAR, to proteins [4, 9, 10] . Several recent descriptions of PARP functions in cellular signaling, miRNA regulation and stress granule formation [12, 13, 14] suggest that many functions for cytoplasmic ADP-ribosylation, especially mono-ADP-ribosylation, likely remain uncharacterized. Moreover, the discovery that a subset of macrodomain containing proteins can, in addition to binding mono-ADP-ribosylated proteins, also remove mono-ADP-ribose from proteins [15, 16] , sheds further light on the regulation and function of this dynamic PTM.

One function of ADP-ribosylation may be to regulate viral infectivity and pathogenesis, consistent with the role of other PTMs in immunity. For example, both vaccinia virus [17] and herpes simplex virus [18] require ADP-ribosylation activity for viral replication. Moreover, diverse RNA viruses, such as alphaviruses, hepatitis E virus, rubella virus and SARS coronavirus encode one or more macrodomains, potentially conferring the ability to specifically recognize, and possibly reverse, ADPribosylation upon these viruses [19] . Mutations in the macrodomain of Sindbis virus led to reduced virulence in mice [20] . Similarly, mutations in the SARS coronavirus macrodomain sensitized the virus to the antiviral effects of the signaling cytokine, interferon (IFN) [21] . As IFN functions as one of the primary mediators of the innate immune system against viruses [22] , these results indicate that macrodomains, and therefore ADP-ribosylation, could be important viral regulators of host immunity. Moreover, host PARP genes can play a direct role in antiviral immunity. For example, overexpression of PARP13, also known as ZAP or ZC3HAV1 (Zinc-finger CCCH-type antiviral protein 1), is sufficient to restrict replication of several different families of viruses, including a retrovirus (murine leukemia virus [23] ), filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg [24] ), a togavirus (Sindbis [25] ) and a hepadnavirus (Hepatitis B virus [26] ). This antiviral activity is mediated through direct binding of viral RNA by PARP13, followed by recruitment of the exosome and specific degradation of viral RNA [27, 28] , although more recently, additional signaling roles for PARP13 have been proposed [14, 29] . Beyond the welldescribed PARP13-mediated antiviral functions, PARP1, 7, 10 and 12 have been shown to play roles in repressing viral replication [30, 31, 32, 33] , although the mechanisms of these antiviral actions are unknown. While these results indicate that there may be a role for individual PARPs in regulating viral infectivity or pathogenesis, there has been no cohesive model for how ADP-ribosylation may influence host-viral interactions.

We reasoned that if ADP-ribosylation is the focus of a host-virus conflict, we might see evolutionary signatures of positive (diversifying) selection acting on the specific host genes involved. Positive selection is a hallmark of host genes locked in genetic conflict with viruses that counter-evolve to evade the host antiviral defenses, and has been seen in both antiviral kinases and antiviral ubiquitin ligases [34] . Positive selection is characterized by the accumulation of amino acid-altering, nonsynonymous changes in the DNA at a rate that is greater than the accumulation of neutral, synonymous changes. When such protein changes are recurrently selected for (due to their adaptive advantage), the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates exceeds one (dN/dS . 1, where dN is the nonsynonymous substitution rate and dS is the synonymous substitution rate). Such analyses can not only identify a gene that has evolved under positive selection but can also pinpoint domains and even individual codons within that gene located at the direct interface between host and viral factors [35, 36] . We previously analyzed primate PARP13 orthologs to determine if the direct antiviral activity of PARP13 has led to a genetic conflict with viruses. Indeed, consistent with its antiviral function, we found a robust signature of positive selection in PARP13 in primates [37] . Interestingly, despite the fact that the zinc-finger domains of PARP13 directly bind viral RNA [27] , we found no signature of positive selection in these domains. Instead, we found sites of positive selection in the PARP catalytic domain, implying that this domain is a target for genetic conflict with viruses [37] . Although this domain in PARP13 appears to lack catalytic activity [4] , we nevertheless found that its removal from PARP13 decreased the level of viral restriction [37] , arguing that some function of the PARP domain remains intact. Thus, using an evolutionary signature of positive selection as a guide, we were able to identify a domain important for the antiviral activity of PARP13.

To address whether ADP-ribosylation plays a broad role in viral immunity, we wished to take a comprehensive evolutionary approach to look for evidence of rapid evolution in all of the human PARP genes. We reasoned that evolutionary signatures of recurrent adaptation, such as those previously observed in PARP13, might reveal other uncharacterized PARP proteins that are involved in host-virus interactions. We therefore screened all 17 human PARP genes and their primate orthologs for signatures of recurrent positive selection. Contrary to expectations that most PARP genes are involved in 'housekeeping' functions, we found that nearly one third of human PARP genes bore signatures of recurrent genetic conflicts. In addition to PARP13, our evolutionary screen revealed four other PARP genes that have evolved under very strong positive selection in primates: PARP4, 9, 14 and 15. Two of these genes (PARP14 and 15) have also undergone dramatic gene turnover (gain and loss) during vertebrate evolution, an additional hallmark of gene innovation also seen in innate immunity genes such as APOBEC3 and TRIM5 [38, 39] . Based on their rapid evolution, we hypothesize that these four additional PARP genes are involved in as-yetundescribed host-virus conflicts. Importantly, we anticipate that the identification of these rapidly evolving PARP genes and domains will enable future experiments to elucidate the role ADPribosylation plays in viral replication and host immunity.

At least five primate PARP genes have evolved under recurrent positive selection Motivated by our hypothesis that ADP-ribosylation may be an important PTM in host-virus conflicts, and our prior use of

The outcome of viral infections is determined by the repertoire and specificity of the antiviral genes in a particular animal species. The identification of candidate immunity genes and mechanisms is a key step in describing this repertoire. Despite advances in genome sequencing, identification of antiviral genes has largely remained dependent on demonstration of their activity against candidate viruses. However, antiviral proteins that directly interact with viral targets or antagonists also bear signatures of recurrent evolutionary adaptation, which can be used to identify candidate antivirals. Here, we find that five out of seventeen genes that contain a domain that can catalyze the post-translational addition ADP-ribose to proteins bear such signatures of recurrent genetic innovation. In particular, we find that all the genes that encode both ADP-ribose addition (via PARP domains) as well as recognition and/or removal (via macro domains) activities have evolved under extremely strong diversifying selection in mammals. Furthermore, such genes have undergone multiple episodes of gene duplications and losses throughout mammalian evolution. Combined with the knowledge that some viruses also encode macro domains to counteract host immunity, our evolutionary analyses therefore implicate ADP-ribosylation as an underappreciated key step in antiviral defense in mammalian genomes.

positive selection analyses to identify an important antiviral domain in PARP13, we investigated whether any of the other 16 human PARP genes also show signatures of recurrent positive selection. We searched publicly available primate genome sequences and identified orthologs of all 17 human PARP family members from a minimum of four hominoids, two Old World monkeys and one New World monkey. We performed a series of maximum likelihood analyses to detect recurrent positive selection for each PARP gene alignment. These analyses determine whether a model allowing positive selection at a subset of amino acid residues is a statistically better fit to the sequence data than a model that does not allow for positive selection. Using PAML software [40] , we found that five PARP genes showed highly statistically significant (p-values ,0.0001) signatures of positive selection ( Figure 1B ). In addition to confirming our earlier findings on PARP13, we found that PARP4 (also known as vPARP) and the three macrodomain-containing PARP genes (PARP9/BAL1, PARP14/BAL2 and PARP15/BAL3) all show signatures of positive selection. We followed up our PAML analyses with the more conservative PARRIS software implemented in the HyPhy package [41] , which takes into account recombination and variation in synonymous substitution rates across codons. Using PARRIS, we again found these five PARP genes to be clearly distinct from the remaining 12 as judged by likelihood ratio tests (LRT) allowing or disallowing positive selection ( Figure 1B) . While our limited screen of seven orthologs in PARRIS only gave a statistically significant p-value (,0.01) for PARP4 and PARP13, analysis of additional sequences of PARP9, PARP14 and PARP15 met statistical significance (see below). Finally, we performed branch-site analyses [42] to look for episodic signatures of positive selection on all 17 primate PARPs. We found that only PARP4, PARP9 and PARP13 demonstrated statistically significant signatures of episodic positive selection ( Figure S1 ). This initial screen might underestimate the total number of PARP genes evolving under positive selection, firstly because our search is restricted to the primate lineage (selection might have operated only in other mammalian lineages) and secondly because we use only seven orthologs. Although such small alignments may lack power to detect weak selection, previous simulation studies have shown that strong selection on a subset of residues can be detected using 1 PARPs are categorized as either poly-ADP-ribosyltransferases (Poly-), mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases (Mono-) or inactive based on presence of conserved motifs and, when available, data using enzymatic assays [4, 6] . 2 PARP9 and PARP13 lack one or more catalytic residues conserved in all other PARPs and are therefore predicted to lack catalytic activity, although it is unknown whether they still bind ADP-ribose or ADP-ribosylated proteins [4] . (B) Results of maximum likelihood tests for positive selection. The five PARP genes showing strong signatures of positive selection are shown in red. Shown at left are values derived from PAML indicating twice the log difference between an evolutionary model that allows positive selection (M8) versus a model that disallows position selection (M8a). P-values indicate whether the model that allows positive selection better fits the data. PARRIS-derived LRT (likelihood ratio test) values also report the difference between the log-likelihood values for a model allowing positive selection versus a model that does not. Using seven orthologs in PARRIS only gave a statistically significant p-value (,0.01) for PARP4 and PARP13, however analysis of additional sequences of PARP9, 14 and 15 found that these genes also met statistical significance (see Results). Additional analyses are reported in Figure S1 . doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004403.g001 PAML even with rather limited species surveys [43] . Given the signatures of positive selection we observed for PARP4, 9, 14 and 15 in this initial screen, we characterized these four genes in further detail, collecting additional orthologous sequences to examine which domains contain positively selected residues in order to create a model for how viral conflict may have driven their evolution.

Highly localized signature of positive selection in PARP4 PARP4, also known as vPARP (vault PARP) is a catalytically active poly-ADP-ribosyltransferase that is a component of widely conserved, large cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein structures known as ''vaults''. Vaults are barrel-shaped particles composed of three proteins, MVP (major vault protein), PARP4, and TEP1 (telomerase associated protein), as well as vRNA (vault RNA) [44] . The function of vaults is unknown, but they have been implicated in drug resistance, cancer and immunity. In support of a role in immunity, MVP, the core structural component of the . 10 mDa mass of vaults, is upregulated by IFN, and vaults are most highly expressed in immune cell types such as dendritic cells and macrophages [45] .

From the alignment of seven PARP4 orthologs, we noted a ,360 amino acid region that was much more divergent than the rest of the protein (Figure 2A , Alignment S1). This protein segment is completely encoded by the largest exon of PARP4 (exon 30 in humans). To illustrate the unusual selective pressures on exon 30, we performed a pairwise dN/dS comparison of human and rhesus PARP4s. We found that whereas the overall dN/dS ratio over PARP4 is 0.63, the dN/dS ratio for exon 30 alone is 1.75 (.95% confidence for dN/dS . 1) (Table S3 ). This striking discrepancy between the evolution of exon 30 and the rest of the protein raised the possibility that this exon alone was responsible for the signature of positive selection in PARP4. We therefore repeated our positive selection analyses with exon 30 alone and found a robust signature of positive selection. In contrast, the remainder of PARP4 showed no signature of positive selection upon removal of exon 30 ( Figure 2B ). Although we cannot formally rule out the possibility of weak selection acting outside exon 30 in PARP4, our analysis strongly suggests that exon 30 of PARP4 has uniquely evolved under strong recurrent positive selection in primates. Because this evolutionary signature is isolated to a single exon, we next asked whether exon 30 is ever excluded from the PARP4 transcript. We searched human and rhesus expressed sequence tag (EST) databases and found that all isoforms of PARP4 include exon 30, suggesting that exon 30 is important for PARP4 function. Next, we searched the region encoded by exon 30 for sequence or structural homology to other protein domains. Surprisingly, secondary structure prediction software (JPRED [46] ) indicated that the region encoded by exon 30 in human PARP4 is almost entirely disordered. Taken together, we conclude that PARP4 has evolved under recurrent positive selection in primates, but that positive selection is focused on the disordered region encoded by exon 30 alone.

We explored the signature of adaptive evolution in exon 30 of PARP4 in more detail by sequencing exon 30 from genomic DNA from additional primates (Table S1 ). Analysis of a total of 15 primate PARP4 exon 30 sequences confirmed our initial screening results that this region has evolved under positive selection (PAML p-value ,0.0001, PARRIS p-value ,0.01) ( Figure S2A and Alignment S1). These analyses also identified several codons within exon 30 that display dramatic signatures of recurrent positive selection (Table S4) . For instance, despite being in close proximity in the primary sequence to codons that are strictly conserved across primates, codon 1517 has undergone at least six amino acid changes during approximately 45 million years of simian primate evolution, with a calculated dN/dS ratio .3 ( Figure 2C ).

We also found that this pattern of rapid evolution in exon 30 extends to other vertebrate lineages. Despite high conservation in the rest of the PARP4 protein, the sequence and length of the largest exon (corresponding to human exon 30) in PARP4 is highly variable among vertebrates. Consistent with our results in primates, all closely related pairs of vertebrate PARP4 orthologs analyzed demonstrated a signature of purifying selection throughout much of PARP4 contrasting with evidence for positive selection in the region corresponding to exon 30 of human PARP4 ( Figure 2D and Table S3 ). To gain further insight into PARP4 evolution outside of primates, we asked whether other mammalian lineages show evidence for recurrent positive selection as we observed in primates. To do this, we took advantage of publicly available bat genome sequences, which, like primates, are divergent enough to provide sufficient evolutionary divergence, but not so divergent that the rate of synonymous mutation (dS) is saturated. Using sequences from 10 bat species (Alignment S2), we again found that PARP4 has evolved under recurrent positive selection in its largest exon (PAML p-value ,0.0001, PARRIS pvalue ,0.01) ( Figure S2B -C). PAML identified six positively sites with high confidence ( Figure S2B -C, Table S5 ). Although there is no overlap between positively selected sites identified in primates and bats, we found nine residues to be absolutely conserved across all 25 primate and bat species we analyzed ( Figure S2B -C), suggesting substantial constraint even within this rapidly evolving disordered protein domain. Combined, these broader phylogenetic analyses indicate that a single PARP4 region has been subject to positive selection throughout mammalian and bird evolution, suggestive of an ancient conflict with intracellular pathogens.

Our evolutionary screen also revealed strong signatures of positive selection in PARP9, PARP14 and PARP15. Strikingly, these three genes encode the only three human proteins that contain both a PARP catalytic domain and macrodomains, and are the only human genes to encode more than one macrodomain. The macrodomain is unique among protein domains in its ability to recognize mono-ADP-ribosylated proteins [47] . Furthermore, some macrodomains have recently been shown to catalyze the removal of mono-ADPr [15, 16] . Although the molecular functions of macro-PARPs are unclear, the presence of both PARP domains and macrodomains may conceivably allow them to both add and specifically recognize and/or reverse protein ADP-ribosylation. This, combined with the presence of macrodomains in viruses, prompted us to explore in more depth the evolution of other human macrodomain-containing proteins and ADP-ribosylhydrolases. Apart from the macro-PARPs, we found no evidence for positive selection in any other human gene encoding a macrodomain or ADP-ribosylhydrolase ( Figure S3 ), suggesting that the combination of the macro-and PARP domains is important for their rapid evolution and, consequently, for their putative antiviral roles.

In order to further pinpoint which domains and codons in the macro-PARP genes have evolved under positive selection, we sequenced additional macro-PARP orthologs from a diverse panel of primates. Combining these with publically available sequences, we aligned and analyzed 15 or more orthologs for each macro-PARP gene (Table S1, Figure S4 ). Based on these expanded alignments, we confirmed the results of our initial screen; all macro-PARP genes have evolved under positive selection in Figure 1A . The region of the protein corresponding to human exon 30 is bracketed in red. Also shown below the schematic is an amino acid identity plot calculated using seven publicly available primate PARP4 sequences. (B) Results of maximum likelihood tests for positive selection from seven publically available PARP4 sequences using the entire gene, exon 30 alone or the entire gene except exon 30. Columns are as in Figure 1B Table S3 . doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004403.g002 simian primates (PAML p-value ,0.0001, PARRIS p-value , 0.01). In contrast to the recurrent positive selection on only a single exon of PARP4, we found that positively selected sites were broadly distributed throughout the macro-PARP genes ( Figure 3A ). For all three macro-PARPs, we observed strong evidence of positive selection acting on the macrodomains. However, removal of the macrodomain-containing segments did not result in a loss of positive selection signatures, indicating that both macrodomains as well as other domains have evolved under positive selection ( Figure 3B ). For instance, we found significant evidence for positive selection in the PARP domain of PARP14 ( Figure 3B ), similar to PARP13 [37] . In contrast, our analyses did not reveal evidence of positive selection acting on the PARP domains of PARP9 and PARP15 ( Figure 3B) , although it is possible that sequencing of additional orthologs might reveal more subtle signatures of selection. Thus, we conclude that macro-PARPs are evolving very rapidly, including substantial positive selection in the macrodomains of all three macro-PARPs.

Our finding that macrodomains encoded by macro-PARP genes have evolved under positive selection motivated us to investigate whether equivalent residues were rapidly evolving in each macrodomain. Such a conserved pattern could suggest that related genetic conflicts (for example, similar viral pathogens) drove their evolution. Instead, we observed that a different set of residues is rapidly evolving in each macro domain at a primary sequence level ( Figure 3C , Tables S6-S8 and Alignment S3). While equivalent amino acids are not evolving in all macro-PARPs, it is possible that positive selection has acted on a single threedimensional protein surface. We therefore modeled the positively selected residues from PARP9 and PARP14 macrodomains onto a structure that has been determined for the first macrodomain of PARP14 [48] . We found that positively selected residues map to a single surface of each macrodomain, but that each macrodomain shows positive selection on a distinct surface ( Figure 3D ). As each positively-selected surface is distinct relative to the site of ADPribose binding, these results suggest that ADP-ribose binding is not being altered or optimized by positive selection of the macrodomains. Instead, our findings suggest that each macrodomain has engaged in its own evolutionary arms race with as-yet-unidentified pathogen factors (see Discussion).

Frequent gene turnover of macro-PARP genes PARP14 and PARP15

Because most antiviral genes do not serve essential housekeeping functions, they can be lost during periods when selective pressures are relieved, for example during periods when fewer relevant viral pathogens are prevalent in the population. In contrast, selection to increase the breadth of antiviral specificities could also lead to increase in gene copy number [34] . As a result of these repeated rounds of innovations, many organisms undergo dramatic changes in their antiviral gene repertoires over evolutionary timeframes, as has been observed with APOBEC and TRIM genes in mammals [38, 39] . In our initial evolutionary screen, we had observed that most of PARP15 is missing from the whitecheeked gibbon genome. Coupled with previous findings of PARP15 absence in the mouse genome [10] , we therefore investigated PARP genes in general, with an emphasis on the macro-PARP genes, for signatures of rapid gene turnover.

From our investigation of all seventeen PARP genes across a wide range of vertebrates, we found that PARP15 is unique in its pattern of recurrent loss ( Figure 4A ). In contrast, other PARP genes are present in all genomes we examined, with the exception of PARP10, which has been lost in the carnivore lineage. To explore the dynamics of PARP15 birth and loss, we conducted a more in-depth survey of PARP15 genes in vertebrate genomes ( Figure S5 ). We found that PARP15 was born early in mammalian evolution via a partial duplication of PARP14, consisting of the second and third macrodomains and the PARP domain. We found that PARP15 has been independently lost via deletion or inactivating mutations in five different mammalian lineages; PARP15 is therefore absent from gibbons, all glires (rodents and lagomorphs), the cow/sheep/dolphin clade, alpaca/camel, and armadillo ( Figure 4B ). Elephant and manatee have a conserved but shorter form of PARP15, missing the first of the two macrodomains. In contrast to these losses in PARP15, we identified several PARP14 duplications that occurred both within and outside the lineage that contains PARP15. For instance, although fish and birds lack PARP15 orthologs, many fish and bird genomes have one or more additional copies of PARP14 that could possibly serve PARP15-analogous functions. Guinea pig and bushbaby each appear to have at least one extra intact copy of PARP14, with the caveat that in each case a single exon is within a genome assembly gap. The microbat (Myotis lucifigus) genome contains at least eight PARP14/15 genes, of which at least two copies are intact (two additional genes are incomplete in the assembly but are uninterrupted in available sequence by stop codons or frameshifts, suggesting they are also intact) ( Figure 4B ). Moreover, pairwise comparisons of duplicated PARP14 genes in microbat and bushbaby suggest that these paralogs may have regions that have rapidly diverged under positive selection ( Figure S7 ), although additional sequences will be required to strengthen such a conclusion. Coupled with our findings that both PARP14 and PARP15 are evolving under positive selection in primates (Figure 3) , the gene turnover we describe for PARP14 and PARP15 supports the idea that these genes have been selected for functional innovation, perhaps in response to a recurrent genetic conflict with pathogens.

Post-translational protein modifications are a common regulatory mechanism for modulating protein activity, stability and localization. As such, numerous viruses manipulate host PTM machinery to regulate their own replication or evade host antiviral immunity. Research aimed at understanding these viral strategies has provided critical insight into the host processes mediated by PTMs, including tyrosine phosphorylation and regulation of histone acetylation [1, 2] . Inspired by the fact that signatures of positive selection can be used to highlight important genes and PTMs in host-virus conflicts, we performed an evolutionary screen on all of the primate PARP genes to ask if ADP-ribosylation is an important player in host-virus dynamics. Contrary to what would be expected of a PTM that is solely dedicated to housekeeping functions, we found strong evidence for rapid evolution in five of seventeen primate PARP genes, suggesting a broad involvement for PARPs, and ADP-ribosylation, in genetic conflicts. Moreover, we observed evolutionary signatures that suggested an ancient history of conflict for these PARP genes. For example, we see positive selection on PARP4 in diverse mammalian clades and recurrent gain and loss of PARP14 and PARP15 across vertebrates. Our findings suggest that PARP4, 9, 13, 14 and 15 are each locked in a genetic conflict, likely with one or more pathogenic agents.

Our data do not exclude the possibility that other genetic conflicts, perhaps in addition to viral conflicts, drove PARP positive selection. Indeed, the first discovery of manipulation of host processes by ADP-ribosylation emerged from the study of bacterial toxins (e.g., diphtheria, cholera toxins) [49] , leaving open the possibility that bacterial or eukaryotic pathogens drove the evolution of PARP genes. However, we hypothesize that viruses may be significant or even the primary pathogens in these evolutionary arms races for several reasons. First, numerous viruses replicate poorly when ADP-ribosylation is inhibited, including viruses that replicate in the nucleus (HSV) [18] and cytoplasm (vaccinia) [17] . Second, several families of mammalian RNA viruses, including corona-and togaviruses, have nonstructural proteins that contain macrodomains. In both coronaand togaviruses, disruption of viral macrodomains has been shown to reduce virulence [20, 21] , and in the case of coronaviruses, this reduced virulence is due to increased sensitivity to the antiviral activity of interferon (IFN) [21] . This suggests a simple model in which the macrodomains (at least in coronaviruses) are required to counteract some IFN-stimulated host gene product. Although the identity of that IFN-stimulated factor is unknown, we note that several of the rapidly evolving PARP genes we identify here, including PARP9, PARP13 and PARP14, are upregulated by IFN [50, 51] . Furthermore, overexpression of PARP9, independent of IFN, is sufficient to upregulate several known antiviral effectors [50] . Finally, overexpression of several PARP genes has been shown to inhibit replication of viruses, the most well-described example being PARP13. Taken together, we favor a model in Tables  S6-S8 ). (B) P-values derived from PAML tests of positive selection on all sequenced macro-PARP orthologs using either macrodomains alone, the entire gene minus the macrodomains or just the catalytic domain. Values in red indicate strong evidence of positive selection, while those in grey indicate a lack of statistically significant evidence for positive selection. (C) Phylogenetic tree of individual macrodomains from macro-PARPs, rooted using human MacroD2 as an outgroup. Macrodomains in italics lack a C-terminal extension found in most macrodomains and lack one or more of the putative catalytic motifs required for ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity [16] (Figure S5 ). This suggests these macrodomains may be able to recognize, but are unlikely to catalyze removal of, ADP-ribosylation. To the right is a schematic of each macrodomain with positively selected residues indicated in red (posterior probabilities greater than 0.95) (see also Alignment S3). (D) Location of positively selected sites in PARP macrodomains mapped on to the structure of the first macrodomain from PARP14 in complex with ADP-ribose (PDB code: 3Q6Z) [48] . ADP-ribose is shown as blue sticks. Residues shown as red surfaces are those that have evolved under positive selection in the indicated macrodomain. doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004403.g003 which PARP gene evolution has been driven primarily by genetic conflicts with viruses.

The patterns of evolution of the PARP genes allow us to make several inferences about the role of these proteins in genetic conflicts. First, the fact that we observe a robust evolutionary signature of positive selection in PARP4, 9, 13, 14 and 15 argues strongly that these genes are important for organismal fitness. Similar to strong evolutionary conservation, signatures of positive selection indicate that fixation of a particular allele, in this case, a novel allele, results in a strong enhancement of fitness. While rapid evolution may seem antithetical to functional constraint, in fact positive selection is a common hallmark of critical host immunity genes [34] . Thus, we infer that the functions of the rapidly evolving PARP genes we have identified are important for fitness in the face of rapidly-evolving pathogens. Second, we also find that PARP14 and PARP15 show recurrent gene duplication and loss. This form of genetic innovation is another common hallmark of immunity genes. Gene losses occur during periods of relaxed selection due to non-exposure or extinction of relevant pathogen(s), whereas gene duplications often provide additional genetic substrates for diversifying selection to increase anti-pathogen repertoires [34, 52] . While other PARP proteins, such as PARP1, PARP7, PARP10 and PARP12 [30, 31, 32, 33] , have been identified as having antiviral functions, our initial screen suggests they have not been subject to strong recurrent antagonistic evolution with viral factors in primates, perhaps because their encoded proteins do not directly interact with virus-encoded factors.

Instead, our analyses lead to our novel hypotheses that PARP4, PARP9, PARP14 and PARP15, as well as the molecular complexes they reside in, possess antiviral activity. For instance, PARP4 is a component of large cytoplasmic structures known as vaults, whose functions are poorly understood. Although vaults are extremely ancient, dating back to the origin of eukaryotes, they have been lost in multiple lineages [9] , suggesting that they are not universally necessary to perform an essential, housekeeping function. Instead, there are several tantalizing pieces of evidence that vaults may be involved in immunity. These include an increased number of vaults in immune cell types, IFN-upregulation of MVP, the major component of vaults, and upregulation of noncoding vault RNAs (vRNAs) on infection with pathogens such as Epstein-Barr virus [45] . PARP4 itself is present at ,10 molecules per vault, but its functional role there is unknown [44] . However, our observation that the positively selected residues we find in PARP4 are localized to a single disordered region in PARP4 suggests a model for its role in vault-mediated immunity. Such a localized pattern of positively selected sites is reminiscent of two well-characterized rapidly evolving antiviral factors, TRIM5a and MxA, shown to be on the 'offensive' (i.e. directly binding to viral proteins) side of the host-virus conflict [34] . TRIM5a and MxA both use their rapidly evolving regions, also in the context of multimeric complexes, to directly recognize and target viral proteins, lentiviral capsids in the case of TRIM5a and orthomyxovirus nucleoproteins in the case of MxA [35, 36] . Thus, we infer that the positively selected region of PARP4 (exon 30 in humans) has evolved to maintain recognition of a factor encoded by pathogens that can infect many diverse mammalian lineages, or is a common means to counteract independent unrelated pathogens. This interaction may be used to directly ADPribosylate viral components, which could affect their activity and impede infection. Alternatively, independent of ADP-ribosylation, PARP4 interaction may recruit viral proteins to the vault structures within virally infected cells, wherein the vault proteins might sequester viral proteins and thereby impede their infectivity.

Likewise, our data highlight macrodomains as likely focal points of host-virus conflicts. However, in contrast to PARP4, which we hypothesize is on the 'offense' i.e., specifically targeting viral proteins, the widely distributed pattern of positively selected sites within the macro-PARPs is reminiscent of other host immunity factors that are evolving on the 'defensive' side (i.e., directly targeted by viral antagonists) of evolutionary arms races [34] . In these cases, the host factor is performing a general antiviral function, such as shutting down host mRNA translation in the case of the antiviral protein PKR (Protein Kinase R), or transducing an antiviral transcriptional program as in the case of the antiviral protein MAVS (Mitochondrial Antiviral Signaling). As a result of their broad action, PKR and MAVS are antagonized by an array of proteins from diverse viral lineages that interact with different regions on the proteins [53, 54, 55, 56, 57] . The widely distributed pattern of positive selection in PKR [58] and MAVS [59] likely reflects this 'defense' against (or escape from) multiple antagonists. We postulate that the dispersed pattern of selection we observe in PARP9, 14 and 15 similarly reflects selection to escape recognition by a variety of distinct viral antagonists of a hypothesized PARPmediated antiviral response (see below), rather than selection to maintain or establish recognition of viral target proteins.

This 'defense' model to explain macro-PARP evolution, combined with the importance of virally encoded macrodomains for the fitness of several RNA viruses, allows us to generate a mechanistic hypothesis for the conflict that may have driven the rapid evolution of macro-PARP genes. In our model, ADP-ribosylation functions as a post-translational modification of either host or viral factors ( Figure 5A ). We posit that macro-PARP proteins are recruited to sites of ADP-ribosylation by their macrodomains, most of which are predicted to be able to recognize, but not remove ADP-ribose ( Figure S5 ), to exert either direct antiviral functions or recruit other antiviral factors. Recruitment of catalytically active macro-PARP genes could also facilitate further ADP-ribosylation of target proteins, allowing macro-PARP proteins to rapidly 'amplify' an initial signal of ADPr. Such a model of amplification by recruitment and additional ADP-ribosylation by PARP proteins has been seen at sites of DNA damage, where PARP1 activation by ADPr leads to increased ADP-ribosylation [7, 8] . We hypothesize that some viruses have overcome this macro-PARP-mediated antiviral response by direct antagonism of macro-PARP proteins ( Figure 5B ). Such antagonism could drive the rapid evolution we see in several regions of the macro-PARP genes, including but not limited to the macrodomains. However, other viruses, such as togaviruses and coronaviruses, have evolved their own macrodomains to either cleave ADP-ribose ( Figure 5C ) or compete with macro-PARP proteins ( Figure 5D ), in order to overcome the effects of the macro-PARP proteins. Although speculative, our model provides testable hypotheses about the genetic and physical interactions between PARP macrodomains, viral macrodomains, and ADP-ribose, and their consequences in terms of determining outcomes of viral infections in cells.

The exact antiviral consequences of macro-PARP action, and their cellular context, still remain unclear. However, recent studies on macro-PARPs implicate two candidate cellular processes. First, several PARP proteins (PARPs 5a, PARP13, PARP14 and PARP15) have been shown to be important for nucleation of stress granules in the cytoplasm, with ADP-ribosylation modulating miRNA activities [14, 29] . This suggests that ADP-ribose in stress granules, or the miRNA functions that are altered by ADPribosylation, are targets for arms races with viruses. Stress granules have been shown to have antiviral properties stemming from mRNA sequestration, degradation and translational repression [60] . In contrast, several viruses localize to stress granules and employ them for replication [60] . Our model suggests that stress granule-associated PARP genes may be evolving to either combat the hijacking of stress granules or miRNA by viruses, or as direct mediators of the antiviral functions of stress granules or miRNAs. Alternatively, macro-PARPs may act at the level of gene expression, where ADP-ribosylation and macro-PARPs may influence transcription regulatory complexes. Indeed, after the initial discovery that PARP9 was highly expressed in aggressive Bcell lymphomas [61] , PARP9 and 14 were shown to regulate expression of several immunity-related genes [50, 62] . Thus, one possible explanation for positive selection in the macro-PARP genes is that viral antagonists target them to prevent transcription of antiviral genes. Such viral antagonism could not only inform us of the role for macro-PARPs in the cells, but could also be used as a guide to devise useful interventions for treatment of the aggressive lymphomas that are associated with high PARP9 expression. Whether macro-PARPs are operating in stress granules or for antiviral transcription, or in both processes, our model suggest that host macrodomains, and ADP-ribosylation, play a critical role in formation of antiviral complexes, whereas viruses actively target these complexes for antagonism.

To summarize, our evolutionary findings of recurrent positive selection of five PARP genes and gene turnover in two of those genes, together with previous observations by others (inhibition of viral replication by some PARP genes, viral modulation by chemical inhibitors of PARP activity, pathogenicity dependent on virally-encoded macrodomains in diverse RNA viruses) argue that ADP-ribosylation is a fundamental determinant of host-virus conflicts. Our results raise compelling hypotheses for the function of rapidly evolving PARP genes in these conflicts, and highlight the insights that can be gained from evolutionary analyses of previously poorly characterized genes.

Publically available genome assemblies from human (Homo sapiens), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), orangutan (Pongo abelii), whitecheeked gibbon (Nomascus leucogenys), rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), baboon (Papio anubis) and marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) were queried for PARP genes. The PARP12 gene is in a poorly assembled region of the orangutan genome and was therefore incomplete. The PARP15 gene is almost entirely deleted from the white-cheeked gibbon genome; exon 4 is still present but contains a stop codon. We therefore used PARP12 and PARP15 sequences from the publically available gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) genome assembly to ensure that seven primate sequences were used in all analyses.

Sequencing of primate PARP genes PARP4 exon 30 sequences were amplified from DNA isolated from cell lines obtained from Coriell Cell Repositories (Camden, NJ), the FrozenZoo (San Diego, CA), ATCC (Manassas, VA) and the Tulane National Primate Research Center (Covington, LA) (Table S1 ). Sequences were amplified by PCR using Phusion (New England Biolabs) polymerase using primers that anneal to the introns around exon 30 (primer sequences in Table S2 ). PARP9, 14 and 15 sequences were amplified from RNA isolated from cell lines (Table S1 ). Sequences were amplified by one step reversetranscription PCR using SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) to produce complementary DNA (cDNA) using the primers listed in Table S2 . Repeated attempts to amplify PARP15 from Siamang gibbon failed, supporting the conclusion that gibbons have lost PARP15. cDNAs were directly sequenced using internal primers by Sanger sequencing. Sequences from gorilla and squirrel monkey (Saimiri boliviensis) were obtained from publically available genome assemblies.

PARP4 exon 30 sequences from primates have been deposited to Genbank under accession numbers KJ699095-KJ699100. PARP9, 14 and 15 mRNA sequences have been deposited to Genbank under accession numbers KJ697725-KJ697749.

Tests for positive selection PARP sequences were aligned in Geneious [63] and alignments were edited to remove gaps and ambiguities. Maximum likelihood (ML) tests were performed with codeml in the PAML software suite [40] . Aligned sequences were subjected to ML tests using NS sites models disallowing (M8a) or allowing (M8) positive selection. The p-value reported is the result of a chi-squared test on twice the difference of the likelihood values between the two models using one degree of freedom. All analyses were consistent when performed with varying models of codon frequency (F61 and F364) and varied starting omega values (0.4 and 1.5). Residues with recurrent signatures of positive selection with a posterior probability greater than 0.95 were identified using a Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis in PAML and the F364 codon frequency model. A second set of maximum likelihood tests was performed using PARRIS in the HyPhy software suite [41] , which also compares models disallowing or allowing positive selection. We report twice the difference in the log likelihood values (LRT), and a p-value based on that difference. Signatures of episodic positive selection were calculated in two ways. Overall dN/dS ratios for each branch of the phylogenetic tree were calculated using the free ratio model in PAML. A branch-site test (Branchsite REL [42] ) for statistically significant signatures of episodic positive selection was performed using the HyPhy software suite [41] .

K-estimator [64] was used for all pairwise sequence analyses of dN/dS ratios. For comparisons of the large exon of vertebrate PARP4 (e.g. human and rhesus exon 30), we used K-estimator to distinguish high pairwise dN/dS values due to positive selection from the possibility that these sequences are neutrally evolving, but that stochastic fluctuations in small mutation numbers cause apparently large dN/dS ratio differences. For a pair of sequences with a certain number of observed mutations, K-estimator uses Monte Carlo simulations to obtain "bootstrap" estimates of how likely it would be to see high dN/dS values if sequences were neutrally evolving. For example, comparing human and rhesus PARP4 exon 30 (dN/dS ratio of 1.75), there is greater than 95% confidence that a dN/dS ratio of 1.75 represents a significant signature of positive selection. Sliding window analyses were performed on pairs of aligned vertebrate PARP4 and PARP14 sequences with a window size of 150 codons and a step size of 50 codons.

To reconstruct the dynamics of PARP14 and 15 gain and loss, publically available vertebrate genome assemblies and gene prediction datasets were queried for PARP genes using a combination of blast searches [65] , pairwise comparisons of genomic sequences using dotter [66] and the sim4cc program [67] that aligns reference cDNA sequences to genomic sequences from other species. We eliminated from further analysis any PARP sequences that contained frameshifts or nonsense mutations, but retained some genes that were missing up to three exons within genome assembly gaps. Protein sequences were aligned using CLUSTALW [68] with manual adjustment and maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees (1000 bootstrap replicates) were constructed using PhyML [69] using the best-fitting evolutionary model (JTT+I+G+F) as determined by Prottest [70] . Trees were displayed using MEGA [71] .

Macrodomains from PARP9 and 14 were aligned and mapped to the known structure of the first macrodomain of PARP14 complexed with ADP-ribose (PDB code 3Q6Z) [48] . Figures were generated using PyMol [72] .

PARP14 and PARP15 genes from vertebrates were aligned as described in Materials and Methods being careful to include only open-reading frames that were uninterrupted by frameshifts or stop codons. Some otherwise intact genes are omitted from the tree because one or more exons are missing due to assembly gaps. The maximum likelihood tree generated from these sequences is shown with bootstrap values indicated. We note that the position of marsupial PARP14-like sequences in this tree implies that the partial PARP14 duplication that gave rise to PARP15 occurred before the divergence of marsupials and placental mammals; however, we have seen no evidence for the presence of PARP15 in marsupial genomes, and the use of alternate phylogeny inference parameters places the PARP14-15 duplication after marsupial-placental mammal divergence. We therefore conservatively suggest that the PARP14-15 duplication occurred after marsupial-placental mammal divergence, rather than the less parsimonious possibility that the duplication occurred earlier and that PARP15 was subsequently lost in the marsupial ancestor.

viruses Immune System Modulation and Viral Persistence in Bats: Understanding Viral Spillover

Bats harbor a myriad of viruses and some of these viruses may have spilled over to other species including humans. Spillover events are rare and several factors must align to create the "perfect storm" that would ultimately lead to a spillover. One of these factors is the increased shedding of virus by bats. Several studies have indicated that bats have unique defense mechanisms that allow them to be persistently or latently infected with viruses. Factors leading to an increase in the viral load of persistently infected bats would facilitate shedding of virus. This article reviews the unique nature of bat immune defenses that regulate virus replication and the various molecular mechanisms that play a role in altering the balanced bat-virus relationship.

Over the past few years, the interest in bat research has increased because of the range of viruses that they harbor and the potential of spillover to humans and other vertebrates [1] . In some instances, there is direct evidence that viruses have spilled over from bats to other vertebrates. For example, Nipah virus spilled over from bats to humans and pigs leading to outbreaks in Southeast Asia and Hendra virus continues to spillover into horses and humans in Australia [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . In other instances, the evidence of virus spillover from bats is circumstantial. For example, in case of ebolaviruses, serological evidence and the detection of viruses related to the ebolaviruses in bats [7, 8] suggests that they are reservoirs of the virus. Recent discoveries of filoviruses in bats of China and Sierra Leone have further bolstered this claim [9, 10] . However, viruses linked to specific Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemics have not yet been detected in bats. Although bats harbor many diverse viruses, their spillover to other animals is extremely rare [11] . One of the reasons is that for a spillover event to take place several factors such as pathogen shedding, environmental conditions, pathogen persistence in environment, and recipient host susceptibility, should all be conducive to transmission. This would result in the "perfect storm" required for spillover. A review by Plowright et al. [12] describes the factors that could lead to such a perfect storm. Here, we focus on one of the initial events affecting this spillover, i.e., an increase in pathogen shedding.

Pathogen shedding by bats is a complex phenomenon regulated by host antiviral defenses and viral factors. A host's defenses attempt to control virus infection but viruses have evolved mechanisms to counteract them [13] . When the host defenses are suppressed, or if the virus is able to circumvent the host immune system, virus replication is enhanced, leading to an increase in virus shedding. The route of shedding is highly dependent on the tissue in which the virus replication occurs. For example, increased replication in the kidney would lead the bat to shed the virus in urine, whereas intestinal replication would result in dissemination through feces. Therefore, it becomes important to study what factors might be responsible for decreasing the host defense or factors that allow the virus to circumvent host immune response. But before exploring factors affecting virus-host interactions, it is imperative to understand the viruses present in bats and the bat immune defenses. In 2013-2014, bat immunology was at a nascent stage and Schountz and Baker et al. [14, 15] had summarized the preliminary knowledge about it in their reviews. In 2017, Schountz et al. [16] again reviewed bat immunology but the article also laid out gaps in our understanding of host pathogen interactions in bats. Here, we include more recent advances in characterizing the bat immune system including a possible link between the evolution of flight in bats and viral persistence. Following that section, we discuss the factors identified so far that upset the balanced bat-virus relationship, potentially leading to the spillover of viruses.

One must be cautious when interpreting the literature on bat defenses. The order Chiroptera contains more than 1200 species [17] . Due to this diversity, the information obtained from one species may not apply to others. For instance, in the black flying fox (Pteropus alecto), the interferon gene locus is contracted, whereas in the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus), this locus is expanded [18, 19] . Other examples are discussed later in this review.

It has been observed that viruses which severely affect other mammals, including humans, are apparently nonpathogenic for bats [20] . This adaptability of bats to harbor many viruses without showing overt pathology suggests that bats have evolved immune mechanisms that allow for benign virus-host relationships.

The immune response has two primary components, innate and adaptive. The host initially responds to infection by activating innate mechanisms. Genes such as those for sensing and repairing DNA damage and the inflammatory process are under positive selection in black flying foxes and David's myotis (Myotis davidii) [21] . For instance, there are mutations in the coding sequence of p53 functional domains that are unique to these bats. Interferons are the primary innate effector molecules that control viral replication. Several types of interferon have been identified in bats, especially Type I and Type III. Type I interferon is induced after virus infection in Egyptian fruit bats whereas Type III interferon is induced similarly in pteropid bats [22, 23] . It is interesting to note that interferon genes in black flying foxes have contracted in terms of diversity. The number of variants of interferon present in these bats is lower compared to those in the gene loci of ten other vertebrate species. Despite this decrease in interferon gene diversity, black flying foxes express these variants at higher basal levels than other mammalian species. This suggests that the interferon and interferon stimulated genes are constitutively expressed in these bats [18] . In contrast, a recent study of the genome of Egyptian fruit bats shows expanded diversity of Type I interferon genes. This, as well as expansion of various other immune genes, suggests novel modes of antiviral defense in bats of various species [24] . Novel modes of antiviral defenses could exist in other species of bats and future studies would help in revealing them.

Cruz-Rivera et al. [25] showed that in cultured cells of black flying foxes, interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were expressed at higher levels than their human counterparts. They also demonstrated that an antiviral effector 2-5A-dependent endoribonuclease (RNase-L) is a unique downstream ISG gene, which is stimulated directly by interferon in bat cells [25] . The activated RNase-L can then cleave viral mRNA. In contrast, in human cells, RNase-L is not directly stimulated by interferon but via an intermediate molecule, 2 ,5 -oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase [26] . Similarly, direct activation of RNase-L was also observed in in vivo experiments with Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) [27] . Inactivation of the RNase-L gene renders bat cells more susceptible to virus infection and direct induction of RNase-L may provide bats with an additional layer of antiviral defense [25] .

These studies suggest that in bats of several species, higher level of interferon and ISGs are always present in their cells, which makes them better prepared to control viruses. Overall, bats seem to possess either an "always ON" interferon strategy plus or a better antiviral ISG defense strategy.

While bats are well prepared to control viral infections, they also have mechanisms to avoid over-induction of inflammatory genes. Such excessive inflammation is detrimental in vertebrates of other species, such as humans, and is linked to pathology [28] . So, it is beneficial for the bats to have evolved mechanisms that would allow them to control excessive inflammation. Cell culture experiments have shown that cells of several species of bats have an inhibitor molecule (cRel) binding site in the promoter region of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), a key inflammatory cytokine. In cells of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), stimulated with poly I:C, a surrogate for double-stranded viral RNA, cRel actively suppresses TNFα expression [29] . Genome analysis of black flying foxes and David's myotis have also demonstrated positive selection pressure on the cRel gene [21] . This suggests that many bats have a mechanism to suppress the expression of TNFα, thereby maintaining a balanced response to viral infection.

Several species of bats control inflammation by having a mutation at a highly conserved serine residue in one of the key adaptor molecules for sensing damaged DNA, i.e., stimulator of interferon genes (STING), which reduces its functionality. STING senses damaged DNA or dsDNA from viruses and induces an interferon response. The replacement of serine at position 358 by other amino acids makes bat STING less effective in activating interferons [30] . In addition to possessing a less effective STING, the pyrin and HIN domain (PHYIN) genes, which are involved in microbial DNA sensing and formation of inflammasome, are absent in bats [21, 31] . These findings demonstrate some of the reasons for reduced inflammation in bats during viral infection. Mechanisms to modulate inflammation may have evolved to mitigate the detrimental effects of flight. Excessive exposure to cytosolic DNA in bat cells during flight might have posed a strong natural selection pressure to reduce the activation of bat DNA sensors.

The unique features of bats, whereby they tolerate viral infections without excessive inflammation while suppressing viral replication, leads to the obvious question: What is so special about bats? The answer to this has been linked to the evolution of the ability to fly. The increased rate of metabolism accompanying flight would lead to higher levels of oxygen-free radicals [32, 33] . This makes bats more prone to generating damaged DNA [34] . As mounting an immune response is energetically expensive [35] and would be detrimental, bats probably evolved mechanisms to suppress activation of immune response due to damaged DNA generated via flight, thereby leading to reduced inflammation. This would also explain why bats of certain species live longer than expected given their high metabolism and small size [36] . In bats the evolutionary suppression of inflammation and consequent susceptibility to virus infection is counteracted by constitutive expression of innate immune genes or novel genes to target viruses as described earlier. This model has been depicted in in Figure 1 . Development of flight necessitated the evolution of bats with the ability to modulate the consequences of increased metabolic activity by suppressing inflammation (left). Inflammation was suppressed by dampening the activation of DNA sensors, such as STING, and reducing levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα (center). These traits were positively selected but a reduced inflammatory response made it advantageous for virus replication (lower right). Increased susceptibility of cells to virus replication was compensated by selection of more effective antiviral measures, such as higher constitutive expression of Interferons or unique ISG expressions (upper right).

Over the past few years, numerous viruses have been detected in bats and these viruses seldom cause any overt disease (with the exception of Tacaribe virus and rabies virus) [1, 16, 37] . Detection of virus and absence of disease have led researchers to suggest that bats are likely the reservoirs of these viruses. Asymptomatic infections have been observed in bats for human pathogens such as henipaviruses (Nipah and Hendra viruses), coronaviruses (Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)), and filoviruses (Marburg virus and ebolaviruses) [38] [39] [40] . For a species to be a viral reservoir, the virus needs to persist in the population. Two probable ways in which this can happen are (1) virus infection and clearing from infected individuals is an ongoing process and introduction of naïve individuals maintains the virus in the population and (2) individuals infected with the virus are able to maintain the virus in the form of a persistent infection. Although either or both of these possibilities may influence the bat-virus relationship, there is considerable evidence for the maintenance of some viruses in bat populations by continued, low-level persistence.

A study done by Sohayati et al. [41] , done on captive large flying foxes (also known as Malayan flying fox; Pteropus vampyrus), showed the possibility of recrudescence of Nipah virus (NiV). Regular sampling was done for over a period of one year to study the presence of virus and level of antibody against it. The authors discovered that one bat had a waning antibody titer with subsequent detection of virus in the urine. Following virus shedding, the antibody levels increased in this animal. As virus was undetectable in earlier samples of the same bat, the authors suggest that the virus may have persisted, probably in certain organs or cells, rendering it undetectable in blood, throat swab or urine. Within two weeks after NiV was isolated from the bat, two other male bats seroconverted and demonstrated an increase in antibody titers, suggesting that recrudescence led to horizontal transmission.

Other studies on Marburg virus transmission among Egyptian rosette bats (R. aegyptiacus) showed that bats naturally infected by other experimentally inoculated bats, seem to have a prolonged incubation period [42, 43] . Furthermore, the infected bats remained viremic and shed infectious virus for up to three weeks, after which there was no detectable virus in blood, oral swabs and urine samples. Despite the lack of detectable virus, even four months after initial infection, experimentally inoculated bats were able to transmit the virus to other contact bats [43] . One of the ways in which this can be explained is that Marburg virus persisted in the bats (probably in the spleen [42] ), and a decrease in antibody levels led to increase in viral load which could then be shed to infect other bats/animals. A bat coronavirus was also shown to persistently infect North American little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) [44] . Little brown bats in captivity were able to harbor the coronavirus in their intestines and lungs during hibernation for a period of four months. In addition, there was no significant pathology seen in the bat tissues.

To further bolster the claim of viral persistence in wild bats, a population level study was performed to understand the circulation of zoonotic viruses in bat populations and the involved immune mechanisms (maternal antibody and acquired immune response) using mathematical modelling [45] . The study used sero-surveillance of an African henipavirus in straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum). While repeated introduction of virus and birthing of pups might drive viral dynamics in a large panmictic population of bats, prolonged infectious periods or latent infection of bats are required to explain henipavirus persistence in small populations (natural or colony of captive). They found that if repeated introduction of virus into small populations was the only mechanism, then acute infections would have to be~40 days in duration. This estimate is considerably longer than the current estimates of the detectable infectious period for henipaviruses in fruit bats, which is approximately 7 days [46] . Therefore, prolonged or latent infection has to occur in some bats for describing persistence of henipavirus in small populations.

Spillover events are complex and usually require successful alignment of several contributing factors [47] . One such critical factor is increased shedding of virus by bats. This factor is influenced by the host response and virus replication. Plowright et al. [47] proposed a hypothesis which states that viruses infect naïve susceptible bats leading to acute infection. This subsequently progresses to a chronic or latent infection. The virus then reactivates from time to time in response to a variety of physiological and environmental triggers. This hypothesis is called the SILI hypothesis: Susceptible-Infectious-Latent-Infectious [47] . As described above, the bat immune system is unique and virus infection probably persists in many bats.

Several factors may alter long-term, low-level viral persistence in bats. Suppression of the immune response holding active virus replication in check would allow the virus to replicate to higher levels. This could happen in stressful conditions that affects the immune system. In other animals, a variety of stressors lead to reactivation of latent herpesviruses as reviewed by Grinde [48, 49] . In neurons latently infected by herpes simplex virus -1 (HSV-1), viral replication is inhibited by the recruitment of CD8 + T cells which secrete interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and suppress viral transcription factors via noncytolytic granzyme mediated degradation [50] . During stress, there is a reduction of HSV-specific CD8 + T cells capable of producing IFN-γ. This contributes to reactivation of the virus [51] . Studies on murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV-68) in mice have shown that latent gammaherpesviruses are sequestered in cells in the spleen and can be reactivated by stress [52, 53] . Stressors, such as unfolded protein responses and hypoxia, can induce the expression of viral immediate early genes that help in initiating the lytic cycle of virus thereby reactivating it [54] .

Arousal from hibernation is a stressful event for bats [55] . Many big brown bats are latently infected with a gammaherpesvirus [56] . Gerow et al. [57] demonstrated that the virus reactivates from latency when big brown bats arouse from hibernation, leading to detection of the virus in blood. This reactivation was also associated with a low level of antibodies against the virus. Following hibernation the antibody levels increase, which subsequently drives the virus into latency.

In pteropid bats, immunological stress was suggested as a contributing factor in henipavirus shedding [41] . As described earlier, Sohayati et al. [41] suspected that the recrudescence of NiV infection was triggered by waning antibody levels and an increased level of stress due to a combination of factors such as confinement in a cage, and physiological and behavioral changes during breeding season.

Secondary infections in humans are immunologically stressful [58] . Little brown bats are particularly susceptible to a frequently lethal fungal infection known as the white nose syndrome, caused by Pseudogymnoascus destructans [59] [60] [61] . A study looking at the effects of white-nose syndrome fungus on a persistently infecting coronavirus showed that bats having the fungal infection in wings had 60 times more coronavirus in their intestines as compared to fungal uninfected bats [62] . The intestines of the fungus-infected bats exhibited a gene expression profile suggesting suppression of the innate antiviral response, which may have contributed to unrestrained viral replication. This suggests that secondary infections in bats persistently infected with viruses could increase the potential of viral shedding.

These studies indicate that waning antibody levels and suppression of innate immune response due to stress might be some of the factors leading to an increase in viral levels in persistently infected bats ( Figure 2 ).

Viruses 2019, 11, x 6 of 10 HSV-specific CD8 + T cells capable of producing IFN-γ. This contributes to reactivation of the virus [51] . Studies on murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV-68) in mice have shown that latent gammaherpesviruses are sequestered in cells in the spleen and can be reactivated by stress [52, 53] . Stressors, such as unfolded protein responses and hypoxia, can induce the expression of viral immediate early genes that help in initiating the lytic cycle of virus thereby reactivating it [54] . Arousal from hibernation is a stressful event for bats [55] . Many big brown bats are latently infected with a gammaherpesvirus [56] . Gerow et al. [57] demonstrated that the virus reactivates from latency when big brown bats arouse from hibernation, leading to detection of the virus in blood. This reactivation was also associated with a low level of antibodies against the virus. Following hibernation the antibody levels increase, which subsequently drives the virus into latency.

In pteropid bats, immunological stress was suggested as a contributing factor in henipavirus shedding [41] . As described earlier, Sohayati et al. [41] suspected that the recrudescence of NiV infection was triggered by waning antibody levels and an increased level of stress due to a combination of factors such as confinement in a cage, and physiological and behavioral changes during breeding season.

Secondary infections in humans are immunologically stressful [58] . Little brown bats are particularly susceptible to a frequently lethal fungal infection known as the white nose syndrome, caused by Pseudogymnoascus destructans [59] [60] [61] . A study looking at the effects of white-nose syndrome fungus on a persistently infecting coronavirus showed that bats having the fungal infection in wings had 60 times more coronavirus in their intestines as compared to fungal uninfected bats [62] . The intestines of the fungus-infected bats exhibited a gene expression profile suggesting suppression of the innate antiviral response, which may have contributed to unrestrained viral replication. This suggests that secondary infections in bats persistently infected with viruses could increase the potential of viral shedding.

These studies indicate that waning antibody levels and suppression of innate immune response due to stress might be some of the factors leading to an increase in viral levels in persistently infected bats ( Figure 2 ). 

The unique features of bat immune responses that promote viral persistence may exert evolutionary pressures on the virus as well. Bats have superseded rodents in harboring greater number of viruses and also having greater proportion of zoonotic viruses [63] . It is therefore crucial to understand how evolutionary pressure may have a role in the emergence of new viral strains. A recent study found that henipavirus genomes are best adapted to pteropid bats [64] . Adaptation of genomes refers to better capability of the virus to use host cellular machinery for its replication and protein synthesis, which is usually governed by natural selection; diversity in codon usage bias may contribute to it. Codon usage is an interspecies bias where one codon is selected over other synonymous codons in a particular species [65] . Natural selection for viral variants works by selecting codons matching host tRNA abundance. It also selects for variants with the advantage of not activating innate response genes, such as those for toll-like receptor 9. Codon bias analysis suggested that henipaviruses have the highest level of adaptation to pteropid bats. It would be interesting to study whether other viruses also show such codon bias towards their reservoir hosts. We might be able to use such codon bias studies in the future to identify reservoir hosts of spilled over viruses. Due to coevolution with the reservoir host, the viruses would have a codon bias specific towards their reservoir host. Apart from codon bias, natural selection based on receptor utilization also has a role to play in the evolution of viruses. Variation in the efficiency of bat coronaviruses to recognize human receptors show that the viral spike protein evolved in a stepwise manner to infect human cells [66] . Despite several other receptor-binding studies [67, 68] , the mechanism of adaptation to new hosts is not definitively understood.

Although there is some evidence for the increase in virus replication and shedding in bats under stress, a direct link of this to spillover events has yet to be discovered. Future controlled experiments aimed at studying transmission dynamics in the presence and absence of stress in bats would lead to a more definitive answer. It is also important to look into various factors that might stress bats such as habitat destruction (deforestation), pregnancy, change in seasons, and climate change. Additionally, the molecular mechanisms leading to the waning of antibodies and other aspects of adaptive immune response in bats are not known. A holistic picture of bat immune systems and the factors leading to an increase in viral replication might help us further understand viral spillovers.

Prostaglandin E 2 stimulates normal bronchial epithelial cell growth through induction of c-Jun and PDK1, a kinase implicated in oncogenesis

Background: Cyclooxygenase-2-derived prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ), a bioactive eicosanoid, has been implicated in many biological processes including reproduction, inflammation and tumor growth. We previously showed that PGE 2 stimulated lung cancer cell growth and progression through PGE 2 receptor EP2/EP4-mediated kinase signaling pathways. However, the role of PGE 2 in controlling lung airway epithelial cell phenotype remains unknown. We evaluated the effects of c-Jun and 3-phosphoinositede dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) in mediating epithelial cell hyperplasia induced by PGE 2 .

Method: The bronchial epithelial cell lines BEAS-2B and HBEc14-KT were cultured and then treated with PGE 2 . PDK1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and a PDK1 inhibitor, an antagonist of the PGE 2 receptor subtype EP4 and EP4 siRNA, c-Jun siRNA, and overexpressions of c-Jun and PDK1 have been used to evaluate the effects on cell proliferation.

We demonstrated that PGE 2 increased normal bronchial epithelial cell proliferation through induction of PDK1, an ankyrin repeat-containing Ser/Thr kinase implicated in the induction of apoptosis and the suppression of tumor growth. PDK1 siRNA and a PDK1 inhibitor blocked the effects of PGE 2 on normal cell growth. The PGE 2induced PDK1 expression was blocked by an antagonist of the PGE 2 receptor subtype EP4 and by EP4 siRNA. In addition, we showed that induction of PDK1 by PGE 2 was associated with induction of the transcription factor, c-Jun protein. Silencing of c-Jun using siRNA and point mutations of c-Jun sites in the PDK1 gene promoter resulted in blockade of PDK1 expression and promoter activity induced by PGE 2 . In contrast, overexpression of c-Jun induced PDK1 gene promoter activity and expression followed increased cell proliferation.

Conclusion: PGE 2 increases normal bronchial epithelial cell proliferation through increased PDK1 gene expression that is dependent on EP4 and induction of c-Jun. Therewith, our data suggest a new role of c-Jun and PDK1 in mediating epithelial cell hyperplasia induced by PGE 2 .

Cancer claims over half a million lives in the United States annually, and lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer death in both men and women. An estimated 226,160 new cases of lung cancer was diagnosed in 2012 in the United States alone, and 160,340 lung cancer deaths are estimated to occur [1] . Chronic inflammation has been associated with an increased risk of cancer. Protein levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a mediator of inflammation, were reported elevated in several cancer types, including colorectal, prostate, and lung cancers, and suppression of either COX-2 expression or COX-2 activation, is being considered for cancer prevention and therapy [2] . Of the five prostaglandins (PG) produced by COX-2, PGE 2 appeared to play essential roles in tumor cell proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and immunosuppression [3] [4] [5] . Four receptor subtypes are known to bind PGE 2 , and they are named EP1-4. These receptors have also been implicated in tumor cell growth and progression [6, 7] . PGE 2 is increased in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease also showing a higher incidence of lung cancer [8] .

Three-phosphoinositede dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) is a master kinase, which is crucial for the activation of AKT / protein kinase B (PKB) and many other AGC kinases including protein kinase C (PKC), S6 protein kinase (S6K), and serum-and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase (SGK) [9] . As an upstream regulator of AKT, PDK1 signaling is thought to play a key role in cancer cell growth, survival and tumor angiogenesis [10, 11] . Studies have shown high levels of activated PDK1 in a large percentage of common tumor types, including melanoma, breast, lung, gastric, prostate, hematological, and ovarian cancers [12] . When activated in tumor cells, Akt also has multiple effects that promote disease progression, including suppression of apoptosis and stimulation of tumor cell proliferation, metabolism, and angiogenesis [13] [14] [15] . Thus, the PDK1/Akt signaling pathway represents an attractive target for the development of small molecule inhibitors that may be useful in the treatment of cancer. However, the effects of PGE 2 on human bronchial epithelial cells are not clear. Here, we explore the effects of PGE 2 on human bronchial epithelial cell proliferation and the intracellular signals involved in this process. Our studies show that PGE 2 stimulates human bronchial epithelial cell proliferation through the EP4 receptor and activation of c-Jun, which increases the expression of PDK1.

The human bronchial epithelial cell lines BEAS-2B and HBEc14-KT were obtained from John Minna (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA). They were maintained in KERATINOCYTE-SFM medium (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with human recombinant epidermal growth factor 1-53 (EGF 1-53) and bovine pituitary extract (BPE). Cells were plated into six-well culture plates at an initial seeding density of 5 × 10 4 cells per well. The plates were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 in air at 37°C. Lipofectamine 2000 reagent was purchased from Invitrogen. The CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit was purchased from Promega. Polyclonal antibodies against PDK1 and phosphorylated PDK1 (ser 241) were purchased from Cell Signaling. The polyclonal antibody against c-Jun was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Polyclonal antibody against EP4, a 16, 16-Dimethyl-PGE 2 (dmPGE2) solution in methyl acetate and AH23848, OSU-03012 were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co.

Real time PCR was performed to assess whether PDK1 expression was modulated by PGE 2 . Total RNA was isolated using the RNA Bee kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) as per manufacturer's instructions. One μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed as per protocol using TaqMan® RT reagents (Applied Biosystems) at 37°C for 120 min followed by 25°C for 10 min.

Forty ng of cDNA per reaction were used in the real time PCR using the ABI Prism® 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Foster City, CA). In the presence of Ampli-Taq Gold DNA polymerase (ABI Biosystems, Foster City, CA), the reaction was incubated for 2 min at 50°C followed by 10 min at 95°C. Then the reaction was run for 40 cycles at 15 s, 95°C and 1 min, 60°C per cycle (Table 1) . Assays-on-Demand™ primers and probes specific for the oxytocin receptor (Applied Biosystems; ID number Hs00168573-m1) were used in the PCR. GAPDH was measured and used to normalize all samples using the ΔΔCT method (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression of PDK1 is expressed relative to GAPDH and untreated samples in each stimulation study, respectively. At least three replicates were run for each condition.

The procedure was performed as previously described [16] . Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. 5 μg protein from whole-cell lysates were solubilized in 5× SDS sample buffer and separated on SDS 10 % polyacrylamide gels. Blots were incubated with antibodies against c-Jun, PDK1, EP4, GAPDH, and phosphorylated PDK1 (c-Jun, PDK1, pPDK1 and EP4 in the concentrations of 1:1,000 for 2 h; GAPDH in the concentration of 1:10000 for 1 h) at room temperature. After washing several times, the blots were followed by incubation with a secondary goat antibody raised against rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:2,000; Santa Cruz). The blots were washed, transferred to fresh chemiluminescence solution (Amersham) for about 1-2 min, and exposed to X-ray film. In controls, the primary antibodies were omitted or replaced with a control rabbit IgG. for Western blot and cell growth and gel mobility shift assays.

The human PDK1 promoter ligated to the luciferase reporter gene were a gift from Drs. Michalik and Desvergne (Center for Integrative Genomics, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland) and have been reported previously [17] . The PDK1 promoter construct contains ∼ 663 bp of the human PDK1 promoter connected to the pGL 2 vector. Briefly, normal bronchial epithelial cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 10 5 per well in 24-well dishes and grown to 50-60 % confluence. For each well, 0.4 μg of the above PDK1 plasmid DNA constructs, with or without 0.5 μg of the internal control phRL-TK Synthetic Renilla Luciferase Reporter Vector, were co-transfected into the cells using lipofectamine 2000 reagent . After 24 h of incubation, cells were treated with or without dmPGE 2 for 4 h. The preparation of cell extracts and measurement of luciferase activities were carried out using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter kit according to recommendations by the manufacturer (Promega). The assays for firefly luciferase activity and Renilla luciferase activity were performed sequentially in a Labsystems Luminoskan Ascent luminometer equipped with dual injectors. Changes in firefly luciferase activity were calculated and plotted after normalization with changes in Renilla luciferase activity within the same sample.

Normal bronchial epithelial cells were plated at the indicated densities (2 × 10 3 cells/well) in 96-well multiwell culture plates (Costar). Cells were treated with inhibitor or antagonist for 2 h before exposure of the cells to PGE 2 in the culture medium (containing 10 % FBS). In separate experiments, cells were transfected with control, PDK1, EP4 or c-Jun siRNAs or expression vector for 40 h before exposure to PGE 2 for up to 4 days. Cell proliferation was evaluated using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay, a homogenous method of determining number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present which signals the presence of metabolically active cells.

All experiments were repeated a minimum of three times. All data from western blot analysis, real-time PCR, and luciferase assays were expressed as mean ± SD. In cell viability assay, the bar graphs represented the mean ± s.d. of relative cell viability compared to the control group of at least three independent experiments. In western blot analysis, the optical densities (OD) of pPDK1, PDK1, EP4 and C-Jun were normalized to the OD of GAPDH in the same membrane. The data represented the mean ± s.d. of relative OD compared to the control group of at least three independent experiments with three samples in each. In transient transfection assay, the bar graphs represent the mean ± s.d. of relative luciferase activities compared to the control group of at least three independent experiments. One-way anova analyses followed by the Least Significant Difference (LSD) test were performed. Asterisks showed in the figures indicate significant differences of experimental groups in comparison with the corresponding control condition. P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results PGE 2 increases cell proliferation and phosphorylation and expression of PDK1 in HBEc14-KT and BEAS2B cells PGE 2 has been shown to stimulate lung cancer cell proliferation [18] . To examine the effects of PGE 2 on human bronchial epithelial cell proliferation, HBEc 14-KT and BEAS2B cells were treated with increased concentrations of dmPGE 2 for 72 h. As shown in Fig. 1a (Fig. 1e ).

Having established a role for PDK1 in PGE 2 -stimulated normal bronchial epithelial cell proliferation, we examined whether the effects of PGE 2 on PDK1 expression occur at the transcriptional level. We found that PGE 2 induces the expression of PDK1 mRNA (3.462 ± 0.103 vs 1.000 ± 0.020 in BEAS2B, P <0.01; 6.218 ± 0.138 vs 1.008 ± 0.069 in HBEc14-KT, P <0.01) (Fig. 1f ) and activity of PDK1 gene promoter (1.666 ± 0.177 vs 1.000 ± 0.039 in BEAS2B, P <0.05; 2.714 ± 0.187 vs 1.000 ± 0.043 in HBEc14-KT, P <0.01) (Fig. 1g) . We therefore conclude that PGE 2 increases cell proliferation in normal bronchial epithelial cells by activation of the PDK1.

EP4 mediates the cell proliferation and increased expression and activation of PDK1 induced by PGE 2 in HBEc14-KT and BEAS2B cells PGE 2 binds to and activates four distinct receptor subtypes named EP1-4. EP4 has been shown to a target molecule in cancer cell proliferation [19] . To investigate the mechanisms involved in PGE 2 -mediated bronchial epithelial cell proliferation, we transfected cells with EP4 siRNA or pre-treated cells with the EP4 antagonist AH23848 (10 μM). After pre-treatment with EP4 siRNA or antagonist, cell proliferations induced by PGE 2 decreased ( Fig. 2a and b) . EP4 antagonist AH23848 decreased cell proliferation induced by PGE 2 (1.456 ± 0.046 vs 2.078 ± 0.299 in BEAS2B, P <0.01; 1.131 ± 0.052 vs 1.838 ± 0.074 in HBEc14-KT, P <0.01). EP4 siRNA decreased cell proliferation induced by treatment with PGE 2 (1.243 ± 0.018 vs 1.480 ± 0.029 in BEAS2B, P <0.05; 1.086 ± 0.124 vs 1.866 ± 0.015 in HBEc14-KT, P <0.01). This effect was associated with inhibition of phosphorylation and expression of PDK1 ( Fig. 2c and d) (Fig. 2e) . So we conclude that EP4 mediates cell proliferation induced by PGE2 in normal bronchial epithelial cells.

The PDK1 gene promoter contains multiple transcription factor-binding sites, including two sites for c-Jun. Then we explored the role of c-Jun in mediating PGE 2induced PDK1 expression in normal bronchial epithelial cells. PGE 2 induces the expression of c-Jun protein in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3a) . C-Jun reached its peaks at 2 h in BEAS2B cells and 4 h in HBEc14-KT cells with the concentration of 1 μM of dmPGE 2 , compared to the control group (2.561 ± 0.189 vs 1.000 ± 0.063 in BEAS2B, P <0.01; 1.347 ± 0.132 in HBEc14-KT, P <0.01). c-Jun reached its peak with the concentration of 1 μM of dmPGE 2 after incubation for 4 h, compared to the control group (1.499 ± 0.108 vs 1.001 ± 0.063 in BEAS2B, P <0.01; 1.536 ± 0.174 vs 1.000 ± 0.024 in HBEc14-KT, P <0.01). Silencing of c-Jun with its siRNA decreases cell proliferation (1.115 ± 0.054 vs 1.386 ± 0.072 in BEAS2B, P <0.05; 1.030 ± 0.104 vs 1.495 ± 0.072 in HBEc14-KT, P <0.01) (Fig. 3b) and (See figure on previous page.) Fig. 1 The effect of dmPGE 2 on human bronchial epithelial cell proliferation and induction of expression and activation of PDK1. a Effects on cell proliferation. b dmPGE 2 increases the phosphorylation and expression of PDK1 in a time-and dose-dependent manner in BEAS2B and HBEc14-KT cells. c PDK1 inhibitor OSU-03012 decreases cell proliferation induced by dmPGE 2 in normal bronchial epithelial cells. d PDK1 siRNA decreases the cell proliferation induced by dmPGE 2 in normal bronchial epithelial cells. e PDK1 plasmid increases the cell proliferation induced by dmPGE 2 in normal bronchial epithelial cells. f Effect on mRNA expression. g Effect on PDK1 promoter activity the expression of PDK1 induced by PGE 2 (1.105 ± 0.011 vs 2.534 ± 0.029 in BEAS2B, P <0.01; 1.157 ± 0.021 vs 1.892 ± 0.027 in HBEc14-KT, P <0.01) induced by dmPGE 2 (Fig. 3d) . Transfection with c-Jun plasmid increases the cell proliferation (1.741 ± 0.051 vs 1.518 ± 0.059 in BEAS2B, P <0.05; 1.772 ± 0.258 vs 1.521 ± 0.027 in HBEc14-KT, P <0.05) (Fig. 3c ) and the expression of PDK1 induced by PGE 2 (2.278 ± 0.134 vs 1.196 ± 0.095 in BEAS2B, P <0.05; 2.453 ± 0.141 vs 2.056 ± 0.163 in HBEc14-KT, P <0.05) (Fig. 3e) .

Having shown the important role of PDK1 in PGE 2related NSCLC proliferation, we further investigated whether the PGE 2 -mediated up-regulation of PDK1 reflected transactivation of the gene. To this end, we performed transient transcription experiments using human PDK1 promoter-reporter constructs connected to a luciferase reporter gene and found that PGE 2 increased PDK1 promoter activity. The induction of PDK1 promoter activity by PGE 2 was inhibited by c-Jun siRNA (1.319 ± 0.028 vs 1.716 ± 0.069 in BEAS2B, P <0.01; 1.171 ± 0.071 vs 1.468 ± 0.101 in HBEc14-KT, P <0.05) (Fig. 3f ) . Exogenous overexpression of c-Jun enhanced the PDK1 promoter activity (1.753 ± 0.037 vs 1.401 ± 0.075 in BEAS2B, P <0.05; 1.762 ± 0.117 vs (Fig. 3g) . The induction of PDK1 gene promoter activity by PGE 2 was abrogated when the one of c-Jun sites at -4382 bp was mutated in the PDK1 gene promoter, suggesting a critical role for c-Jun in mediating the effect of PGE 2 on PDK1 gene promoter activity (Fig. 3h) . dmPGE 2 increased PDK1 promoter activity (2.432 ± 0.358 vs 1.000 ± 0.039 in BEAS2B, P <0.05); point mutation of c-Jun with ac to tt at −4028 site could not derease PDK1 promoter activity (1.9832 ± 0. vs 1.000 ± 0.024 in BEAS2B, P <0.05); point mutation of c-Jun site with ac to tt at -4382 bp dereased PDK1 promoter activity (1.010 ± 0.011 vs 1.000 ± 0.039 in BEAS2B, P <0.05);

The transformation is driven by both endogenous and exogenous factors including chemical agents that induce the activation of cancer-promoting genes. Accumulating epidemiologic and clinical data provide a strong link between inflammation and cancer initiation and progression [20, 21] , but the molecular inflammatory determinants remain to be established. COX-2 derived PGE 2 is a proinflammatory bioactive lipid and is the major prostaglandin produced in many human solid tumors, including cancer of the colon [22] , stomach [23] , breast [24] and lung [25] . PGE 2 and its receptors play an essential role in promoting cancer progression. For example, PGE 2 significantly enhanced carcinogen induced colon tumor incidence and multiplicity in rats. PGE 2 accelerates intestinal adenoma growth in Apc Min mice [26] . However, the effects of PGE 2 on human bronchial epithelial cells are not clear.. Therefore, we will focus on PGE2 and its receptors and its downstream targets in human bronchial epithelial cells, and explore the potential mechanism. This is the first study on the effects of PGE 2 in inducing the activation of cancerpromoting genes in normal bronchial epithelial cells. In concordance with studies performed in tumor cells before, we demonstrate PGE 2 increases normal bronchial epithelial cell proliferation, through increased PDK1 gene expression that is dependent on EP4 and induction of c-Jun. It unveils a novel role of c-Jun and PDK1 in mediating epithelial cell hyperplasia induced by PGE 2 . Three-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) is a major mediator of cellular signaling between phosphoinositide-3 kinase and various intracellular serine/ threonine kinases, including PKB, p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase, and protein kinase. PDK1 is able to phosphorylate Thr-308 on PKBα [27, 28] , which has been shown to play a crucial role in normal and pathophysical conditions. Activation of PDK1 has been shown to regulate cell survival and growth, cell cycle progression, gene expression and differention [9, 29] . Autophosphorylation and growth-factorinduced phosphorylation in its activation loop is required for PDK1 activity [30] . S241A mutation abolished PDK1 catalytic activity completely, which suggests phosphorylation at Ser-241 is important for PDK1 signaling [31] . There is increasing evidence that PDK1 is involved in cancer progression and invasion. Tissue microarray analysis of human invasive breast cancer has revealed that phosphorylation of PDK1 on Ser-241 was strongly enhanced in 90 % of the samples tested [11] . Immunohistochemical analysis using anti-phospho-Tyr-9 antibodies demonstrated that the level of Tyr-9 phosphorylation is increased markly in diseased lung, liver, colon, and breast tissue compared to normal tissue [12] . Studies have shown that angiotension-II-induced focal adhesion formation is inhibited by infection with Adeno-PDK1-Y9F via paxillin [10] . This regulation of focal adhesion suggests that PDK1 participates in integrating signals that control cell growth, apoptosis and migration. PDK1 gene has been assoiated with poor differentiation of late stage lung cancer [32] . PDK1 was shown capable of augmenting tumorigenesis in tissues harboring ERBB2 amplifications [33] , PTEN deletions [34] , and mutations in the catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PIK3CA) [35] . Inhibition of PDK1 is therefore expected to attenuate tumors associated with deregulated PIK3CA/PTEN signaling. Indeed, hypomorphic mutation of PDK1 in Pten +/− mice delays the onset of tumorigenesis, and small molecule inhibitors of PDK1 inhibit tumor xenografts and lung colonization [36] . Further, PDK1 inactivation effectively attenuated the development of Kras oncogene-driven pancreatic cancer, but not NSCLC, further supporting the importance of PDK1 in tumor development, albeit, in select cancer types [37] . Here, we found that PGE2 increased the expression of PDK1 in bronchial epithelial cells. Overexpression of PDK1 enhanced cell proliferation, while cells stimulated with PDK1 inhibitor or siRNA reduced cell growth. These findings provides the first genetic evidence that PDK1 may also play an essential role in abnormally enhanced cell proliferation induced by PGE2 in bronchial epithelial cells, which was convinced in tumor cells in previous studies. Consistent with former studies, PDK1 inactivations by small molecule inhibitor of PDK1 or siRNA effectively attenuated cell proliferation in bronchial epithelial cells, supporting the potential importance of PDK1 in NSCLC development. PDK1 also plays a crucial role in metastasis. This kinase mediates mammary epithelial cell growth and invasion in the transformed phenotype, in part, by membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) induction, which in turn activates MMP-2 and modulates the extracellular matrix proteins decorin and collagen [11] . Knockdown of PDK1 inhibits spontaneous migration and epidermal-growth-factor-induced chemotaxis in breast cancer cells. In severe combined immunodeficiency mice, PDK1-depleted human breast cancer cells form tumors more slowly and are defective in extravasation to the lungs after intravenous injection [38] . These results indicate that PDK1 plays an important role in regulating malignancy in breast cancer cells. Moreover, reducing PDK1 expression in PTEN +/− mice protects these animals from developing a wide range of tumors [36] , thereby providing genetic evidence that PDK1 is a key effector in mediating neoplasia that result from loss of PTEN. In addition, PDK1 is an upstream kinase of AKT, which regulates activities of AKT, in turn, mediates the regulation of tumor cell growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis [39] . All these results validate PDK1 is a promising anticancer target for the prevention of tumors.

PGE2 exerts its cellular effects by binding to its cognate receptors (EP1-4) that belong to the family of seven transmembrane G protein coupled rhodopsin-type receptors [40] . The central role of PGE2 in tumor-genesis has been further confirmed through homozygous deletion of its receptors. Mice with homozygous deletion in EP1 and EP4 receptors, but not EP3, were partially resistant to colon carcinogen mediated induction of aberrant crypt foci [41, 42] . EP2 disruption decreases the number and size of intestinal polyps in APC △716 knockout mice [43] . In addition to colorectal cancer, it has been shown that EP1, 2, and 4 receptors were elevated whereas EP3 receptor levels were decreased in mammary tumors in COX-2-MMTV mice [44] . It was showed that PGE 2 promotes lung cancer cell migration via EP4-betaArrestin1-c-Src pathway [45] . In this study, blockade of EP4 by antagonists or by EP4 siRNA resulted in reduced PDK1 protein expression and activity of PDK1 promoter, suggesting that EP4 mediates the effect of PGE2 on PDK1 expression in normal bronchial epithelial cells. The EP4 receptor can activate several pathways that involve cell proliferation, adhesion, invasion and migration. These main molecules include G protein, adenylyl cyclase, protein kinase A, exchange protein directly activated by cAMP, phosphodiesterase, phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Most recently, we found that the EP4 receptor could increase the expression of JNK [16] , which has been found to play a pivotal role in activating transcription factors (including c-Jun) that increase cellular growth and tumor formation in NSCLC cells. We also showed that activation of PI3-K, PKA, and JNK induced by EP4 was involved in the effect of PGE 2 on c-jun in NSCLC [46] .

Specific mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades control the activation of fos and jun family protooncogenes and their protein products (c-Jun and c-Fos) are known as the AP-1 family members. These "early response protooncogene" products dimerize to form the AP-1 transcription factor, a converging point that regulates the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, transformation, inflammation, pulmonary defense, and autoregulation of AP-1 gene transcription [46] . Early studies [47, 48] suggested that c-Jun had a role in early events in the pathogenesis of lung cancers because it was highly expressed in 31-50 % of patients with nonsmall cell cancers, and it was also upregulated in atypical bronchial epithelium. One study showed a transgenic mouse model directing conditional expression of the dominant-negative c-Jun mutant TAM67 in lung epithelial cells decreased tumor number and overall lung tumor burden in chemically induced mouse lung tumor models [49] . c-Jun is an important transcriptional activator of PDK1. Notably, expression of PDK1 is sufficient to restore tumor growth after c-Jun knockdown in melanoma cells, suggesting that PDK1 is an important mediator of c-Jun oncogenic activities [50] . Consistent with this, we found that PGE 2 increased the expression of c-Jun and exogenous overexpression of c-Jun enhanced bronchial epithelial cells proliferation and expression of PDK1, whereas inhibition by PDK1 inhibitor or siRNA caused inhibitions of cell growth and expression of PDK1. This suggests that c-Jun is an upstream regulator of PDK1 signaling. Induction of c-Jun by PGE 2 regulates the expression and activation of PDK1 and cell growth. It indicated c-Jun might play an important role in the potential mechanism of abnormal cell proliferation in brochial epithelial cells.

In summary, our findings demonstrate that PGE 2 stimulates human bronchial epithelial cell proliferation through activations of EP4-related signal and c-Jun, which, in turn, increases activation and expression of PDK1. This suggests that PDK1 and c-Jun might play an important role in human bronchial epithelial cells thereby influencing their growth.

A fast and robust iterative algorithm for prediction of RNA pseudoknotted secondary structures

Background: Improving accuracy and efficiency of computational methods that predict pseudoknotted RNA secondary structures is an ongoing challenge. Existing methods based on free energy minimization tend to be very slow and are limited in the types of pseudoknots that they can predict. Incorporating known structural information can improve prediction accuracy; however, there are not many methods for prediction of pseudoknotted structures that can incorporate structural information as input. There is even less understanding of the relative robustness of these methods with respect to partial information.

We present a new method, Iterative HFold, for pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure prediction. Iterative HFold takes as input a pseudoknot-free structure, and produces a possibly pseudoknotted structure whose energy is at least as low as that of any (density-2) pseudoknotted structure containing the input structure. Iterative HFold leverages strengths of earlier methods, namely the fast running time of HFold, a method that is based on the hierarchical folding hypothesis, and the energy parameters of HotKnots V2.0. Our experimental evaluation on a large data set shows that Iterative HFold is robust with respect to partial information, with average accuracy on pseudoknotted structures steadily increasing from roughly 54% to 79% as the user provides up to 40% of the input structure. Iterative HFold is much faster than HotKnots V2.0, while having comparable accuracy. Iterative HFold also has significantly better accuracy than IPknot on our HK-PK and IP-pk168 data sets.

Iterative HFold is a robust method for prediction of pseudoknotted RNA secondary structures, whose accuracy with more than 5% information about true pseudoknot-free structures is better than that of IPknot, and with about 35% information about true pseudoknot-free structures compares well with that of HotKnots V2.0 while being significantly faster. Iterative HFold and all data used in this work are freely available at computational methods for prediction of RNA structure are valuable.

Currently computational RNA structure prediction methods mainly focus on predicting RNA secondary structure-the set of base pairs that form when RNA molecules fold. When multiple homologous (evolutionarily related) RNA sequences are available, the secondary structure of the sequences can be predicted using multiple sequence alignment and comparative sequence analysis [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Alternative approaches, which can be used to predict secondary structure of a single sequence, are

RNA molecules are crucial in different levels of cellular function, ranging from translation and regulation of genes to coding for proteins [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Understanding the structure of an RNA molecule is important in inferring its function [7] [8] [9] [10] . Since experimental methods for determining RNA structure, such as X-ray, crystallography and NMR, are time consuming, expensive and in some cases infeasible, http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/147 based on thermodynamic parameters derived in part from experimental data [23] . While thermodynamics-based approaches can be less accurate than comparative-based algorithms, thermodynamics-based approaches are applicable in cases of novel RNAs such as the many RNAs of unknown function recently reported by the ENCODE consortium [24] . Thermodynamics-based approaches can also be easier to apply to prediction of the structure of interacting RNA molecules, for example, in gene knockdown studies.

Many computational thermodynamics-based methods find the structures with the minimum free energy (MFE) from the set of all possible structures, when each structure feature is assigned a free energy value and the energy of a structure is calculated as the sum of the features' energies. There has been significant success in prediction of pseudoknot-free secondary structures (structures with no crossing base pairs) [23, 25, 26] . While many small RNA secondary structures are pseudoknot-free, many biologically important RNA molecules, both in the cell [27, 28] , and in viral RNA [29] are found to be pseudoknotted.

Since finding the MFE pseudoknotted secondary structure is NP-hard [30] [31] [32] , polynomial time MFE-based methods for prediction of pseudoknotted secondary structures predict a restricted class of pseudoknotted structures [33] [34] [35] . These methods trade off run-time complexity and the generality of the class of structures they can predict. For example, the most general algorithm of Rivas and Eddy [33] , whose running time is (n 6 ) on inputs of length n, is not practical for RNA sequences of length more than 100 nucleotides. This has been the main reason for development of heuristic methods for prediction of pseudoknotted structures [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . Although heuristic methods may not find the MFE structure, they usually run faster than the MFE-based methods that handle the same class of structures. For example, HotKnots V2.0 [36, 41] is a heuristic approach that uses carefully trained energy parameters, is guided by energy minimization and can handle kissing hairpin structures. However, HotKnots is still slow on long sequences.

Other methods for prediction of pseudoknotted structures, such as the IPknot method of Sato et al. [42] , are motivated by the finding of Mathews [43] that base pairs with high base pairing probabilities in the thermodynamic ensemble are more likely to be in the known structure. In a comprehensive comparison performed by Puton et al. [44] on the performance of publicly available non-comparative RNA secondary structure prediction methods that can handle pseudoknotted structures, IPknot ranks first for general length RNA sequences.

Incorporating known structural information can improve the accuracy of structure prediction. For example, Mathews et al. [45] used SHAPE reactivity data to improve the prediction accuracy from 26.3% to 86.8% for 5S rRNA of E. coli. Roughly, the larger the SHAPE reactivity value for a given nucleotide, the more likely it is that the nucleotide is unpaired in the structure. However, limited SHAPE reactivity data is available, and the data does not unambiguously determine whether a base is paired or not or, if it is paired, to what other nucleotide. Deigan et al. [46] created pseudo energy terms from SHAPE reactivity data, as a means of integrating such data into prediction software. They reported prediction accuracy of 96% to 100% for three moderate-sized RNAs (< 200 nucleotides) and for 16S rRNA ( 1500 nucleotides). ShapeKnots [47] is a new method for incorporating SHAPE reactivity data for pseudoknotted structures that incorporates the pseudo energy terms into a heuristic method similar to that of Ren et al. [41] .

We previously presented HFold [48] , an approach for prediction of pseudoknotted structures, motivated by two goals, namely to avoid the high running time complexity of other methods for pseudoknotted secondary structure prediction and to leverage the hierarchical folding hypothesis. This hypothesis posits that an RNA molecule first folds into a pseudoknot-free structure; then additional base pairs are added that may form pseudoknots with the first structure so as to lower the structure's free energy [49] . Given a pseudoknot-free structure as input, HFold predicts a possibly pseudoknotted structure from a broad class that contains the given input structure and, relative to that constraint, has minimum free energy. HFold's running time is O(n 3 ), significantly faster than other methods for predicting pseudoknotted structures. Several experts have provided evidence for, and support, the hierarchical folding hypothesis [49] [50] [51] [52] . The class of structures that HFold can handle, density-2 structures, is quite general and includes many important pseudoknots including Htype pseudoknots, kissing hairpins and infinite chains of interleaved bands, with arbitrary nested (pseudoknotted) substructures. (Roughly, a structure is density-2 if no base is enclosed by more than two overlapping pseudoknotted stems.) Another advantage of HFold over heuristic methods such as HotKnots or ShapeKnots is that unlike these methods, HFold minimizes the free energy of the possibly pseudoknotted output structure relative to the given input structure. Therefore HFold's method of adding pseudoknotted stems is better motivated energetically than that of HotKnots or ShapeKnots.

While HFold is fast, our earlier implementation of HFold had its own shortcomings. First, due to a high pseudoknot initiation penalty in its underlying energy model, many of its predicted structures did not have pseudoknots. Also low band penalty (i.e., penalty for addition of pseudoknotted stems or bands) in its energy model encouraged addition of pseudoknotted stems when a pseudoknot was predicted. Second, if the first structure http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/147 input to HFold contains base pairs that are not in the true pseudoknot-free structure for the given RNA sequence or is not the complete pseudoknot-free structure (i.e., it does not include all the base pairs in the pseudoknot-free structure), HFold is often unable to predict the known pseudoknotted structure as output.

To summarize, existing methods for prediction of pseudoknotted structures suffer from one or both of the following shortcomings: 1) slow running time, or 2) poor prediction accuracy. Moreover there is limited opportunity for the user to provide structural information, or constraints, that can guide prediction. In cases of a prediction method that incorporates user-defined constraints, it is also useful to understand the degree to which the method's accuracy persists as the input information degrades. We use the term robustness with respect to partial information or robustness to refer to this property of a method. (We note that in our definition of robustness we do not mean robust with respect to noise.) To the best of our knowledge, the concept of robustness in secondary structure prediction methods has not been studied before.

In this work we present a new method that addresses these shortcomings. Our method, Iterative HFold, takes a pseudoknot-free input structure and produces a possibly pseudoknotted structure whose energy is at least as low as that of any (density-2) pseudoknotted structure containing the input structure. Iterative HFold incorporates four different methods and reports as its final structure the structure with the lowest energy, among all structures produced by these methods. While one of its underlying methods, HFold, strictly adheres to the hierarchical folding hypothesis, the other three use iterations to extend or remove the base pairs of input structure, with the goal of finding a structure that has lower energy than the structure found by HFold. Thus, unlike HFold, iterative HFold is able to modify the input structure (while the class of structures handled by both methods is the same). This is valuable since 1) computationally produced structures may not be completely accurate and 2) while the hierarchical folding hypothesis is a useful guiding principle, there is evidence that allowing for disruption of some base pairs in the initially formed pseudoknot-free secondary structure can improve prediction [53, 54] .

All of Iterative HFold's underlying methods use the energy model of HotKnots V2.0 DP09 [36] ; with this model, HFold obtained predictions with higher accuracy than those obtained with our earlier implementation of HFold. One of Iterative HFold's underlying methods is HFold-PKonly, which given the input structure only adds pseudoknotted base pairs. HFold-PKonly is especially useful for cases when the user has either complete information about the true pseudoknot-free structure or wants to check whether a single stem of the input structure can be part of a pseudoknot since, if the input structure only has the specific stem in question, the output structure of HFold-PKonly will determine if the given stem can be part of a pseudoknot.

Based on our experiments on our HK-PK and HK-PKfree data sets that include 88 pseudoknotted structures, and 337 pseudoknot-free structures respectively, ranging in length from 10 to 400 nucleotides, a single run of Iterative HFold does not take more than 9 seconds time and 62 MB of memory. In contrast, one of the best heuristic methods, HotKnots V2.0, takes 1.7 hours and 91 GB of memory for a sequence with 400 nucleotides. Therefore our method is practical for prediction of long RNA structures. Iterative HFold bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval for average accuracy of pseudoknotted structures of the HK-PK data set is significantly higher than that of IPknot, ((72.83%, 83.37%) vs. (54.56%, 66.25%)) and is comparable to that of HotKnots V2.0, (vs. (73.60%, 83.35%)) two of the best prediction methods available. Iterative HFold's accuracy is significantly higher than that of IPknot and HotKnots on our IP-pk168 data set. Iterative HFold also has higher accuracy than HFold even when just partial information about the true pseudoknot-free structure is provided, so it is more robust than HFold. Specifically, Iterative HFold's average accuracy on pseudoknotted structures steadily increases from roughly 54% to 79% as the user provides up to 40% of the input structure, and improves with a more modest but still positive improvement in accuracy when further structural information is provided.

We represent an RNA molecule by a sequence, S, of its four bases, Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G) and Uracil (U). We denote the length of the RNA molecule by n and refer to each base by its index i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

When an RNA molecule folds, bonds may form between canonical pairs of bases (A-U, C-G, and G-U) (see Figure 1 ). Throughout this work, we consider only cases where each base may pair at most with one other base, and represent base pairing between i and j by i.j. We define a secondary structure, R, as a set of pairs i.j, 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n; i.j and k.j can belong to the same set if and only if i = k.

If i.j and k.l are two base pairs of a secondary structure, R, and 1 ≤ i < k < j < l ≤ n, we say i.j crosses k.l. We refer to a secondary structure with crossing base pairs as a pseudoknotted secondary structure and a secondary structure with no crossing base pairs as a pseudoknot-free secondary structure (see Figure 1 ). Figure 1 shows different kinds of loops in a secondary structure. We refer the readers to Jabbari et al. [48] or Rastegari et al. [56] for precise definition and illustration of terms used in the figure. Figure 1 Pseudoknotted and pseudoknot-free secondary structures. Examples of loops and canonical base pairs in a pseudoknotted and a pseudoknot-free secondary structure. The blue base pairs belong to the G big structure and the green base pairs belong to the G small structure, as defined in Section 'Definition of G big and G small '. This figure was produced using the VARNA software [55] .

Many computational methods for predicting the secondary structure of an RNA (or DNA) molecule are based on models of the free energy of loops [23, 25, 26, [33] [34] [35] [36] 48] . Table 1 summarizes the energy constants and functions used in our energy model for pseudoknotted structures. The values of these energy parameters are those of the DP09 parameter set of Andronescu et al. [36] , used by the HotKnots V2.0 prediction software.

We use three data sets to analyze performance of our algorithms. Our first data set is the test data set of Andronescu et al. [36] , that contains 446 distinct RNA sequences and their reference structures, of which 348 are pseudoknotfree and 98 are pseudoknotted. This set has four structures that are not in the class of structures our methods can handle (i.e., have densities higher than 2 [48] ). Since the number of such structures is too small to be useful in an experimental analysis, we removed them from our set of pseudoknotted structures, resulting in a set of size 442.

There are eight cases in this data set for which the original sequence and structure were shortened to accommodate restrictions in length. We removed them from our data set, resulting in a set of size 425. From now on we use "HK-PK" to refer to the pseudoknotted structures in this set (with 88 structures) and "HK-PKfree" to refer to the pseudoknot-free structures in this set (with 337 structures). RNA sequences in HK-PK and HK-PK-free have length between 10 and 400 nucleotides.

Our second data set is the pk168 data set of Sato et al. [42] . This set contains 168 pseudoknotted structures from 16 categories of pseudoknots. The sequences in this set have at most 85% similarity and have length of at most 140 nucleotides. We refer to this data set as "IP-pk168".

Our third data set is the test data set of Sperschneider et al. [57] . This set contains 16 pseudoknotted structures with strong experimental support. RNA sequences in this set have length between 34 and 363 nucleotides. We refer to this data set as "DK-pk16".

To test the robustness of our methods on a given RNA sequence, we need to provide partial information about the true pseudoknot-free structure as input structure for that sequence. To obtain the true pseudoknot-free http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/147 This table provides the names, description and values of the energy parameters and functions that we used in our methods. The names and definitions are the same as in our original HFold [48] , and the values were updated based on the work of Andronescu et al. [36] . These parameters were derived for a temperature of 37°C and 1 M salt concentration.

structure, G big , we remove the minimum number of pseudoknotted base pairs from the reference structure to make the reference structure pseudoknot-free. If the reference structure is pseudoknot-free, then G big is the same as the reference structure itself. We call the removed base pairs from the reference structure G small . Blue base pairs in Figure 1 represent base pairs of the G big structure and green base pairs represent the G small structure.

Following common practice [36, 58] , we measure the accuracy of a predicted RNA secondary structure relative to a reference secondary structure by F-measure, which is the harmonic mean of sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV ). We define these values as follows:

Number of correctly predicted base pairs Number of base pairs in the reference structure PPV = Number of correctly predicted base pairs Number of predicted base pairs and F-measure = 2 × sensitivity × PPV sensitivity + PPV

We also define these values as 0 when their denominators are 0. When a prediction agrees with the reference structure, the value of F-measure is equal to 1 (so are the values of sensitivity and PPV). When the values of sensitivity or PPV is equal to 0, the predicted structure does not have any base pairs in common with the reference structure.

To formally assess the dependency of measured prediction accuracy of results of a method on a given set of RNA we use bootstrap confidence intervals, a well-known statistical resampling technique [59, 60] . Following the recent work of Aghaeepour and Hoos [61] and Hajiaghayi et al. [58] we calculate the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval of average F-measure as follows. For each vector f of F-measures (where, for example, f may be the F-measures of predictions obtained by Iterative HFold on pseudoknotted structures) we first take 10 4 resamples with replacement, where the resamples have the same length as the original sample vector f (|f |), and then calculate their average F-measures. These 10 4 calculated average F-measures represent the bootstrap distribution for the vector f . We then report the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of this distribution (i.e., the bootstrap distribution of the 10 4 average F-measures calculated above) as the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval respectively, and call it the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval. By reporting the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval for average F-measure of a method, A, on a data set, D, we say that we are 95% confident that the average F-measure of method A on data set D is in the reported interval. All calculations are performed using the "boot" package of the R statistics software environment [62] .

Following the recent work of Hajiaghayi et al. [58] , we use a two sided permutation test to assess the statistical significance of the observed performance differences between two methods. The test proceeds as follows, given a data set and two structure prediction procedures, A and B. First, we calculate the difference mean(f A ) − mean(f B ) in means http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/147 between sets of F-measure values obtained by A and B. Then we combine the two sets f A and f B and record the difference in sample means for 10 4 randomly chosen ways of choosing two sets with the same size as |f A | and |f B | from the combined set. The p-value is the proportion of the sampled permutations where the absolute difference was greater than or equal to that of absolute difference of the means of sets f A and f B . Then, if the p-value of this test is less than the 5% significance level, we reject the null hypothesis that methods A and B have equal accuracy and thus accept the alternative hypothesis that the difference in accuracy of method A and B is significant. Otherwise, we cannot reject the null hypothesis. All calculations are performed using the "perm" package of the R statistics software environment.

We provide a high level description of our Iterative HFold algorithm.

Pseudocode of our Iterative HFold algorithm is available in Additional file 1. The algorithm builds on two simpler methods, the first being our original HFold algorithm [48] :

HFold: Given an RNA sequence, S, and a pseudoknotfree input structure, G, find a pseudoknot-free structure, G such that G∪G is the lowest energy structure that contains G. We note that G ∪ G might not be pseudoknotted.

The second method on which Iterative HFold builds, called HFold-PKonly, is similar to HFold except that G may only contain base pairs that cross base pairs in G. The prediction provided by HFold-PKonly can be useful in cases where HFold does not produce a pseudoknotted structure.

HFold-PKonly: Given an RNA sequence, S, and a pseudoknot-free input structure, G, find a pseudoknotfree structure, G such that every base pair in G crosses some base pair of G and such that G ∪ G is the lowest energy structure that contains G among all such G s. Note that G may contain no base pairs. Iterative HFold also uses the SimFold RNA secondary structure prediction method [63] , which predicts the minimum free energy pseudoknot-free secondary structure for a given RNA sequence. SimFold uses a dynamic programming method similar to Zuker's MFold method [64] . In this work we used the HotKnots energy parameters when running SimFold. In addition to an RNA sequence, S, SimFold can also take a pseudoknot-free secondary structure, G, as input and predict the MFE pseudoknotfree secondary structure that contains all base pairs of G.

Iterative HFold is distinguished from the above three methods, namely HFold, HFold-PKonly and SimFold, in two important ways. First, the output of HFold, HFold-PKonly and SimFold methods must contain the given pseudoknot-free input structure, G, whereas Iterative HFold may modify the input structure. This can be useful when the given input structure is not a high-accuracy estimate of G big , the true pseudoknot-free substructure of the reference structure. Second, while HFold and HFold-PKonly can add base pairs that cross those in G, they cannot add base pairs that cross each other, and neither can SimFold. In contrast, Iterative HFold can add base pairs that cross each other. This is particularly useful when the input structure contains limited information about G big , and so it is necessary both to predict base pairs in G big and in G small in order to get a good prediction.

Iterative HFold is comprised of four different iterative methods. Following the description of each method, we motivate why we chose to include it as part of our overall algorithm. Iterative HFold takes as input both an RNA sequence, S and a pseudoknot-free secondary structure, G; later we show that structure G can be produced by computational methods, for example, HotKnots hotspots or SimFold suboptimal structures, when only the sequence S is initially available.

Iterative HFold: Given an RNA sequence, S, and a pseudoknot free input structure, G, run the following four methods and pick the structure with the lowest free energy among these four as the output structure.

Iterative HFold runs in O(n 3 ) time, as it runs four methods sequentially, when each one is O(n 3 ).

Method 1: Run HFold on S and G, and store the resulting G ∪ G . Motivation: This is the core HFold method, motivated by the hierarchical folding hypothesis. .) ))))) -14.67

example, method 2 of Iterative HFold outperforms method 1: although both HFold and HFold PKonly produce the same result on sequence S and input structure G, namely the structure G ∪ G , the additional iteration in method 2, in which HFold is run with S and G , finds a structure with lower energy than that of G ∪ G . Method 3: First run SimFold on S and G to obtain result G -a pseudoknot-free structure that contains G. Then let G updated be the secondary structure of S containing the relaxed stems of G that include the base pairs of G. By a relaxed stem, we mean a secondary structure containing stacked base pairs, bulges of size 1 and internal loops of maximum size of 3 (i.e., either the symmetric loop of 1 × 1 or the non-symmetric loop of 1 × 2 or 2 × 1 but no other loop types; this is motivated by common practice [65] ). Then run method 2 on S and G updated , and store the result. See Example 2.

Motivation: This method can work well when the given input structure has a small number of base pairs from G big , because G updated contains stems that includes these base pairs, but avoids "overcrowding" with further base pairs that might prevent HFold-PKonly from finding pseudoknotted stems.

In this example, method 3 of Iterative HFold outperforms the other methods. Because the input structure G consists of just one base pair, method 1 (HFold) outputs a pseudoknot-free structure containing G. The output of both methods 2 and 4 are pseudoknotted but do not contain the base pair of the input structure G. In contrast, method 3 first adds base pairs to G, resulting in the pseudoknot-free structure G updated , and then adds .(((........)) ).)))))))))).. .(((........)) ).))))))))))................ .(((........)) ).)))))))))).. (((((.(((.[[[.[[[)) ).))))))))))....... (((....) ))).))..))))...)). -5.10 (((....) ))).))..))))...).. (((..[[) ))).))..))))..))]] -6.05

In this example, method 4 of Iterative HFold outperforms the other methods. The input structure G has a high energy value and neither method 1 (HFold) nor method 2 (HFold-PKonly) can expand the pseudoknot-free structure to add the pseudoknotted stem. Also, by adding too many pseudoknot-free base pairs, method 3 fails to find the pseudoknotted base pairs. Thus, method 4 performs better than methods 1, 2 and 3.

In this section we explain details of our computational experiments.

One of our goals is to understand the degree to which our methods are robust with respect to partial information, that is, provide a reliable prediction even when limited information about the true pseudoknot-free structure, G big , is available. For this purpose we generate subset structures of the corresponding G big , for each RNA sequence in the HK-PK and HK-PK-free data sets. For each α, 0.05 ≤ α ≤ 0.95 with 0.05 steps, we choose each base pair of G big structure with probability α. We also generate 1% information and 99% information about the G big structure (i.e., α = 0.01 and α = 0.99). We repeat this step 100 times to generate 100 substructures of G big for each value of α for each RNA sequence in our data sets. We then run our methods on all 100 substructures for each RNA sequence in our data sets and α value and calculate the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval for average F-measure of these 100 cases as the accuracy interval for each method and each RNA sequence and α value in our data set. We also compare our methods when the true pseudoknot-free structure, G big is provided.

We compare the accuracy of HFold, HFold-PKonly and Iterative HFold with each other on different input structures, and with other methods, namely SimFold [63] , HotKnots V2.0 [36, 41] and IPknot [42] . We first describe the latter two methods and the settings we choose for our experiments. We then describe the ways in which we choose input structures for HFold and its variants.

HotKnots HotKnots is a heuristic program that given an RNA sequence, first finds about 20 lowest energy stems (from the set of all stems for the given RNA sequence), called hotspots. Then keeping all these stems, it adds other http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/147 non-overlapping low energy stems to the stems found in the first step, so as to minimize the energy of the overall structure, eventually producing up to 20 output structures. In our experiments, we choose the structure with the lowest energy value among the 20 output structures as the final structure predicted by HotKnots. When reporting prediction accuracy for HotKnots, we report the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval for the average F-measure of the lowest energy structure for all RNA sequences in our data set.

IPknot IPknot is a secondary structure prediction method based on Maximum Expected Accuracy (MEA) of the base pairs. In addition to the RNA sequence, IPknot gets several parameters as input. Following, we describe each of these parameters and settings briefly.

• level: If structure G can be decomposed into k disjoint pseudoknot-free structures, G 1 , G 2 , . . . , G k , such that every base pair in G i crosses the base pairs of G j , 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ k, Sato et al. say that structure G has k levels. For example, a pseudoknot-free structure has level 1, and an H-type pseudoknot has level 2. In another example, when representing the secondary structure in dot bracket format, the number of different brackets used to represent the structure is the level of the structure. IPknot can handle structures up to level 3. • scoring model: The energy model used to produce posterior probabilities for each base pair is called "scoring model". IPknot has 3 different scoring models, namely "CONTRAfold", "McCaskill" and "NUPACK". • refining parameters: The procedure of recalculating the base pair probabilities based on the original prediction results is referred to as "refining parameters". • base pair weights for each level: Positive numbers representing the rate of true base pairs in each level.

We run IPknot using the provided source code and the default parameters for scoring model and level (i.e., scoring model = McCaskill and level = 2). The default values provided for base pair weights are not the same on the IPknot website (i.e., γ 1 = 2 and γ 2 = 16), its source code (i.e., for some cases γ 1 = 2 and γ 2 = 4 and for others γ 1 = 1 and γ 2 = 1) and the provided perl script (i.e., γ 1 = 4 and γ 2 = 8). We run IPknot with all of these values with and without refinement and provide IPknot's bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for average F-measures for all of our data sets as a table in the Additional file 2. Based on its performance we present IPknot's results with default settings (i.e., no refinement, scoring model = McCaskill and level = 2) and γ 1 = 4 and γ 2 = 8, for comparison with other methods.

We compare the average accuracy of HFold, HFold-PKonly and Iterative HFold with different input structures.

To determine which input structures are good to use when G big is not known, we compare two different options. Since HFold (HFold-PKonly and Iterative HFold) cannot accept pseudoknotted input structures we use the following methods to produce pseudoknot-free input structures to HFold (HFold-PKonly and Iterative HFold). First, we use HotKnots hotspots [36] , i.e., the 20 lowest energy pseudoknot-free stems produced in the first phase of HotKnots. We choose the lowest free energy structure predicted by each of our methods as their final prediction given these hotspots. Second, we use SimFold's MFE structure [63] where the energy parameters of SimFold are changed to match that of HotKnots V2.0.

We ran all methods on the same platform (Macbook pro. OS X 10.5.8 with 2.53 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor and 4 GB 1067 MHz DDR3 RAM). We use the time command to measure the running time of our methods on each sequence, and record the wall clock time.

To find the memory usage of the programs, we use the Valgrind package [66] and record the total heap usage as memory usage of each program. IPknot and HotKnots are completely written in C and so we can easily find their memory usage by running Valgrind. However, Iterative HFold program is a perl script that runs a few C programs (HFold, HFold-pkonly and SimFold) sequentially. So we find the memory usage of each C component using Valgrind and assign the maximum as the memory usage of Iterative HFold.

As mentioned in Section 'Background', in the literature on hierarchical folding, there are reports of counter examples to the hierarchical folding hypothesis where bases that are initially part of the pseudoknot-free structure for a molecule later change as the pseudoknot forms. This motivates a comparison of HFold versus Iterative HFold, in order to see how a method that sticks strictly with the hypothesis (i.e., HFold) compares with a method that allows for some base changes (i.e., Iterative HFold). In Section 'Robustness comparison', we compare the robustness of HFold and Iterative HFold with respect to partial information; that is, the degree to which they provide accurate predictions as a function of how much http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/147 information about G big , the true pseudoknot-free secondary structure, is provided as input. Then in Section 'Accuracy comparison of different versions of HFold' we compare HFold, HFold-PKonly and Iterative HFold when a (possibly inaccurate) computational prediction of G big is provided as input. In Section 'Accuracy comparison with existing methods' we compare Iterative HFold-the method that performs best overall in Sections 'Robustness comparison' and 'Accuracy comparison of different versions of HFold'with existing methods for pseudoknotted secondary structure prediction. Sections 'Running time comparison' and 'Memory consumption comparison' report on the running time and memory usage of our methods.

One of our goals is to learn what is the accuracy of each of our methods when partial information about G big is available (see Section 'Robustness test' for experimental settings). Figure 2 shows the results of this robustness evaluation, for pseudoknotted structures (Figure 2A) , pseudoknot-free structures ( Figure 2B ) and the overall results ( Figure 2C ). Since HFold-PKonly cannot add pseudoknot-free base pairs to the given input structure, we do not compare its performance here with HFold and Iterative HFold. However we provide detailed performance of all versions of HFold including HFold-PKonly in Additional file 3.

As shown in Figure 2A , which pertains to pseudoknotted structures of the HK-PK data set, when provided with ≈ 1% of the G big structure as input, Iterative HFold's bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval of average F-measures has higher accuracy than those of HFold. Iterative HFold continues to be significantly superior to HFold until approximately 90% of G big is available, after which HFold is more accurate. Iterative HFold is most successful when little information about G big is known because it can add both pseudoknot-free and pseudoknotted base pairs. In particular, using methods 3 and 4 (see Section 'Iterative HFold') Iterative HFold first finds a low energy pseudoknot-free structure that includes the given input structure (by extending the stems of the given structure), and then adds pseudoknotted base pairs to further lower the energy of the overall structure. However, when the vast majority of base pairs of G big are provided as input, HFold dominates as it keeps the base pairs of the input structure, thereby often adding base pairs of G small . When 100% of G big is provided as input, HFold's bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval is (85.74%, 91.87%), compared with (79.36%, 87.41%) for Iterative HFold.

As shown in Figure 2A , Iterative HFold's average accuracy on pseudoknotted structures steadily increases from about 54% to 79% as the user provides 1% to 40% of the input structure. This improvement in accuracy slows down but still persists when further structural information is provided. If we compare the slope of the curve for Iterative HFold's average accuracy to that of HFold in Figure 2A , we can see that HFold's slope is steeper than that of Iterative HFold, making Iterative HFold more robust than HFold. For pseudoknot-free structures of the HK-PK-free data set, as shown in Figure 2B , HFold performs better than Iterative HFold. Even with 1% information about G big , HFold results in (79.76%, 84.32%) 95% bootstrap confidence interval in comparison with (79.14%, 83.84%) for Iterative HFold with the same inputs. Roughly, HFold's success for pseudoknot-free structures is because it often http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/147 adds base pairs that do not cross those provided as part of the input, and thus are likely to be in G big .

When 100% of G big is provided as input, the overall bootstrap 95% confidence interval for HFold is (96.11%, 97.24%) compared with (93.85%, 96.07%) for Iterative HFold.

Often, partial information about G big is not available; this is the case for many RNAs of unknown function reported by the ENCODE consortium [24] . Therefore, we next compare the quality of results obtained by HFold, HFold-PKonly and Iterative HFold when given a pseudoknot-free input, G that is predicted by existing computational methods. One way to produce an input structure is to use an MFE pseudoknot-free structure prediction method, such as MFold. We chose SimFold as it is an implementation of MFold and, because of its energy parameters, gives more accurate predictions than MFold. Of course, when comparative information is available, the user can input such information as structural constraint as a pseudoknot-free structure to Iterative HFold and expect a better prediction result. Here we compare two methods for predicting G, namely SimFold and the hotspots produced by HotKnots V2.0. Table 2 reports the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence intervals of average F-measures. The accuracy of HFold-PKonly is significantly worse than that of HFold and Iterative HFold, both with the output of SimFold, and with the HotKnots hotspots as input, so we do not discuss HFold-PKonly further.

For pseudoknotted structures, using HotKnots hotspots as input is far superior to using SimFold as input, for both HFold and Iterative HFold. This appears to be because MFE structures predicted by SimFold tend to have more base pairs than the true pseudoknot free structure, G big , so that HFold and Iterative HFold are unlikely to add pseudoknotted base pairs to the input structure. For pseudoknotfree structures, using SimFold as input is somewhat better than using HotKnots hotspots, but the permutation test indicates that the difference is not significant.

The confidence intervals for HFold and Iterative HFold with HotKnots hotspots are (73.35%, 83.53%) and (72.83%, 83.37%), respectively, and on pseudoknot-free structures they are (75.53%, 80.79%) and (74.93%, 80.26%) respectively. Again, based on the result of the permutation test, the difference in the results of HFold and Iterative HFold on pseudoknotted and pseudoknot-free structures are not significant. Similarly, the permutation test shows that the difference in prediction accuracy of HFold and Iterative HFold on SimFold input is not significant.

For comparisons with other methods already in the literature, we choose to use our Iterative HFold method with HotKnots hotspots as input structure, based on its overall good accuracies in Section 'Accuracy comparison of different versions of HFold'. We compare this method with two of the best-performing methods [44] for prediction of pseudoknotted structures, namely HotKnots V2.0 [36] , a MFE-based heuristic method, and IPknot [42] , a method that is based on maximum expected accuracy. (Prepared by Puton et al. [44] , CompaRNA, is the website for continuous comparison of RNA secondary structure methods on both PDB data set and RNA strand. We chose IPknot because it was the best-performing noncomparative pseudoknot prediction method that can handle long RNA sequences, based on the ranking on their website as of March 25, 2014 . We also noticed that Puton et al. used HotKnots V1 for their comparison, and not the more recently available and better performing Hot-Knots V2.0. Therefore we chose to include HotKnots in our comparisons as well. Since the focus of this paper is on prediction of pseudoknotted structures, we do not compare our results with that of Co-Fold [26] or other methods for prediction of pseudoknot free structures.) Table 3 presents the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval of average F-measure for Iterative HFold with hotspots as input, HotKnots V2.0, Sim-Fold and IPknot with default setting (see Section 'Accuracy comparison tests') on the HK-PK and HK-PKfree data sets. For pseudoknotted structures, our permutation tests show that the difference in accuracy of Iterative HFold and HotKnots is not significant. However, the superior accuracy of Iterative HFold compared with SimFold and IPknot is significant. For pseudoknotfree structures, the difference in accuracy between IPknot, Iterative HFold, HotKnots and SimFold is not significant. Table 4 presents the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval for average F-measure for Iterative HFold (with hotspots as input), HotKnots and IPknot (with default setting) on the IP-pk168 and DK-pk16 data sets.

Our permutation tests show that the difference in accuracy of Iterative HFold, HotKnots and IPknot on the DK-pk16 data set is not significant. However, the superior accuracy of Iterative HFold compared with HotKnots and IPknot on the IP-pk168 data set is significant.

Since prediction of pseudoknotted structures are of interest to us, we only report running time comparison on pseudoknotted structures of our HK-PK data set. Figure 3 presents result of time comparison between Iterative HFold and HotKnots in a log plot (when log is in base 10). The X axis shows log(time) for HotKnots data points and the Y axis shows log(time) for Iterative HFold on the HK-PK data set. RNA sequences in this data set are between 26 and 400 bases long. HFold runs significantly faster than HotKnots and finishes under 1.5 seconds for even the longest RNA sequence in our data set (400 bases). HotKnots is faster than Iterative HFold on sequences of up to 47 bases, where Iterative HFold starts being faster than HotKnots. Iterative HFold runs in less than 8.3 seconds for all RNA sequences in this data set whereas HotKnots runs for over 6000 seconds (about 1.7 hours) on the longest RNA sequence in our data set. information about performance of each method see Additional file 4.

Here we present memory consumption of HFold, Iterative HFold and HotKnots on our HK-PK pseudoknotted structures. Since HotKnots predicts and keeps about 20 structures in memory, its memory consumption can vary significantly from one sequence to another, and is not predictable. 

In Section 'Comparison with Hotknots and IPknot' we provide more insight on the differences and merits of Iterative HFold, HotKnots and IPknots. Then in Section 'Comparison with ShapeKnots' we compare accuracy of Iterative HFold with ShapeKnots, a method that incorporates SHAPE reactivity data to predict RNA pseudoknotted secondary structure. In Section 'Iterative HFold with SimFold's suboptimal structures' we compare performance accuracy of Iterative HFold with two inputs: HotKnots hotspots and suboptimal structures. Section 'Energy model' provides more insight into the energy model used in this work.

Comparing accuracy of Iterative HFold and HotKnots V2.0 on HK-PK, HK-PK-free, DK-pk16 and IP-pk168, we found that the difference in their accuracies is insignificant on HK-PK, HK-PK-free and DK-pk16 data sets when Iterative HFold is provided with HotKnots hotspots as input. Based on our results on the HK-PK data set, with only about 15% information about the true pseudoknot-free structures, Iterative HFold's 95% percentile confidence interval is (65.08%; 73.36%) (data shown in Additional file 3). If the user has about 35% information about the true pseudoknot-free structure, Iterative HFold's accuracy is comparable with that of HotKnots (i.e., (74.18%; 82.30%) vs. (73.60%; 83.35%)). However Iterative HFold's accuracy (with hotspots as input) is significantly better than that of HotKnots on the IP-pk168 data set. One of the advantages of Iterative HFold over HotKnots is that in Iterative HFold base pairs are added to lower the energy of the given structure while in HotKnots stems are added in a way that does not take into account the energy of stems in the previous steps.

When reporting on time and memory consumption of Iterative HFold and HotKnots on the HK-PK data set, we did not include the time and memory required to get the input structures to Iterative HFold. Since we only run Hot-Knots V2.0 partially to produce hotspots it does not take as long as running HotKnots and does not consume as much memory. For example, for the 400 nucleotides long RNA sequence in our data set (A.tum.RNaseP), it only takes 0.5 seconds time and 4 MB of memory to produce the hotspots. (The time required to get the hotspots for all RNA sequences in this data set is provided in Additional file 4.) We also note that since calculating hotspots and running Iterative HFold are done sequentially, the memory consumption is calculated as the maximum of the two, so the memory consumption of Iterative HFold for this sequence is still the same even including the memory needed for calculating hotspots. As we can see based on this example, even including time and memory requirements of calculating hotspots, Iterative HFold is still faster than HotKnots and uses less memory.

We also compared Iterative HFold with IPknot [42] . While IPknot is faster than Iterative HFold and uses less memory, we found that for the HK-PK and IP-pk168 data sets, Iterative HFold provides significantly more accurate predictions of pseudoknotted structures, compared with IPknot. Based on our results on the HK-PK data set, Iterative HFold's performance with more than 5% information about the true pseudoknot-free structure, is better than that of IPknot with default settings (data shown in Additional file 3). We note that Sato et al. [42] find the performance of IPknot with predictions using "NUPACK" superior to all versions of IPknot, but since this model can be used for RNA sequences of length < 80 nucleotides, we did not compare our results with this version of IPknot. Among all different versions of IPknot we tested, we found all but γ 1 = 1 and γ 2 = 1 setting producing similar confidence intervals for all but the HK-PK-free data sets, for which γ 1 = 4 and γ 2 = 8 produces the best result (data shown in Additional file 2). While running parameter refinement with one iteration improved the confidence intervals in the HK-PK data set, it did not result in any improvement in accuracy in the rest of our data sets as in many cases IPknot failed to produce results. We note that our results on the IP-pk168 data set with different weight parameters perfectly match the results of Sato et al. [42] .

A disadvantage of IPknot over Iterative HFold is that being an MEA-based method, IPknot does not produce free energy of the predicted structure. Also to get the best prediction, the user needs to provide some guidance as to what type of structure to predict for the given sequence, e.g., whether pseudoknot-free or pseudoknotted.

Similar to HotKnots, the ShapeKnots method of Hajdin et al. [47] is a heuristic algorithm for prediction of pseudoknotted structures. This method incorporates SHAPE reactivity data as a pseudo energy term into the prediction method. SHAPE reactivity data is only available for a limited number of RNA sequences, so we cannot compare Iterative HFold with ShapeKnots on our data set. Therefore, we use data set of Hajdin et al. to compare these two methods. In their data set Hajdin et al. have 18 RNA sequences in their training set and 6 RNA sequences in their test set. We run Iterative HFold with hotspots for each RNA sequence and choose the lowest http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/147 energy structure as the final output of our program. For Shapeknots, we use the sensitivity and positive predictive values reported in the work of Hajdin et al. [47] to compare with Iterative HFold. Table 5 shows the results of this comparison. In all but one sequence of the test set, Iterative HFold obtains higher accuracy than ShapeKnots. The exception is the HIV-1 5' pseudoknot domain; Hajdin et al. note that the accepted structure of HIV-1 5' pseudoknot domain is based on a SHAPE directed prediction and thus an accuracy comparison between ShapeKnots and Iterative HFold may be biased towards ShapeKnots. In the training set, however, Iterative HFold does not perform as well as ShapeKnots. This might be because parameters of ShapeKnots were tuned on the training set to achieve the highest possible accuracy. Since both the training and test data sets are small, we cannot make more general statements about the significance of the differences in accuracy between the two methods.

To further investigate which input structures are good to use when G big is not known, we use the first 50 suboptimal structures produced by SimFold (including the MFE structure). Then for each RNA sequence we run our methods on all 50 suboptimal structures and choose the one with the lowest free energy as the final result for that RNA sequence. With this approach, the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval of average F-measure of HFold and Iterative HFold is (61.80%, 80.63%) and (67.70%, 79.57%) respectively for pseudoknotted structures and (77.17%, 82.35%) and (76.27%, 81.46%) respectively for pseudoknot-free structures. The permutation test indicates that the difference between these results and the corresponding results when input structures are hotspots is not significant. We also test the significance of results of HFold with first 50 suboptimal structures versus Iterative HFold with the same input structures and Iterative HFold with hotspots for both pseudoknotted and pseudoknot-free structures. Although the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence intervals for average F-measures seem different, the permutation test indicates that the difference is not significant. Similarly, results of Iterative HFold with the first 50 suboptimal structures are not significantly better or worse than the result of HFold with hotspots as input structures for both pseudoknotted and pseudoknot-free structures.

In this paper we use the HotKnots V2.0 DP09 [36] energy parameters in our implementation of Iterative HFold. To investigate the degree to which the energy model may be causing mis-predictions by HotKnots V2.0 or Iterative HFold, we considered the degree to which the maximum accuracy structures produced by these methods, i.e., the structure with highest F-measure, is better than the minimum free energy structures. Similarly, if we compare the maximum accuracy structure output by Iterative HFold with the minimum free energy structure, whether given HotKnots hotspots or the first 50 suboptimal structures to Iterative HFold as input, the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence intervals of average F-measure also show improvement -see Table 6 . The difference in improvements is significant in all but one case, namely Iterative HFold on hotspots structures as input for pseudoknotted structures of the HK-PK data set. We conclude that improvements on the energy parameter values for pseudoknotted structures may further improve accuracy of both HotKnots and Iterative HFold.

In this work we present Iterative HFold, a fast and robust iterative algorithm that matches the accuracy of the best existing pseudoknot prediction methods. Iterative HFold is significantly more accurate than IPknot while matching the accuracy of HotKnots on the HK-PK data set. Iterative HFold is superior to both IPknot and HotKnots on the IP-pk168 data set. Moreover both Iterative HFold and IPknot use less memory and run much faster than HotKnots on long sequences.

Iterative HFold also has lower rate of accuracy deterioration than HFold with loss of information about the true pseudoknot-free structure, so it is more robust than HFold. This is particularly helpful when the given input structure may be unreliable and/or limited information about the true pseudoknot-free structure is available. Iterative HFold is also more accurate than ShapeKnots [47] on the test set of Hajdin et al. [47] .

In this work, we compared two different ways to generate pseudoknot-free input structures for input to Iterative HFold, namely the first 50 suboptimal structures produced by SimFold, and HotKnots hotspots. On the HK-PK and HK-PK-free data sets, accuracy of Iterative HFold is not significantly different on each of these. An alternative approach that may be worth exploring in future work would be to use the most highly probable base pairs, as calculated using the partition function [43] . Even better may be to calculate base pair probabilities for base pairs of pseudoknotted RNA structures; however this requires (n 5 ) time. Since HFold finds minimum free energy structure in O(n 3 ) time, conditional on the given input structure, we are currently investigating ways to develop an O(n 3 )-time partition function version of HFold that can produce pseudoknotted base pair probabilities that are conditional on the given input structure.

Middle East respiratory syndrome: pathogenesis and therapeutic developments

The first case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was identified in the year 2012, which spread rapidly and increased to more than 2200 in 2018. This highly pathogenic virus with high mortality rate is among one of the major public health concerns. Saudi Arabia remains to be the most affected region with the majority of MERS-CoV cases, and currently, no effective drugs and vaccines are available for prevention and treatment. A large amount of information is now available regarding the virus, its structure, route of transmission and its pathophysiology. Therefore, this review summarizes the current understanding of MERS-CoV's pathogenesis, treatment options and recent scientific advancements in vaccine and other therapeutic developments, and the major steps taken for MERS prevention control. Coronaviruses are positive stranded RNA viruses, and while most of these infect animals, particularly bats, a minor number can also cause human diseases [16] . Human coronaviruses can be broadly divided into types, α and β coronavirus [17] . MERS-CoV is from the β-coronavirus family [18] . It has four major surface proteins that help the virus to enter the cells viz. envelope protein (E), spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein and membrane (M) protein. The spike (S) protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein made up of S1 and S2 subunits. The S protein is crucial for virus entry through binding and fusion to host cells. The S1 subunit has a receptor binding domain (RBD) that binds with the DPP4 receptor of the host [18, 19] . The S2 subunit contains heptad repeats H1 and H2 which forms the main membrane fusion unit [20] . The E protein is required for assembly, intracellular transport and budding of virus [21] . The M protein has its role in viral morphogenesis and assembly [22] . N proteins and S, E and M proteins interact to form complete virus particles [23] . In addition to these structural proteins, MERS-CoV has two large polyproteins called pp1a and pp1ab. These proteins are broken down by proteases to form various nonstructural essential proteins, such as enzymes [24, 25] . Recent studies have revealed that these viral structural and nonstructural proteins can be exploited as novel targets for therapeutic purposes [26] [27] [28] .

The infection caused by MERS-CoV has an average incubation time of 5 days (2-14 days range). The host, in this time period, shows no symptoms of infection. The clinical symptoms of the disease range from mild symptoms of upper respiratory infection like cough, fever and myalgia to severe forms such as pneumonitis, as well as respiratory failure. Patients may also suffer from abdominal pain, appetite loss, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and other gastrointestinal symptoms. The less commonly occurring symptoms include hemoptysis and diarrhea without any hint of fever [29] . Studies advocate that chronic illnesses, such as chronic heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes and hypertension, increase the risk of MERS-CoV infection and its severity [30] , though further proof is required.

MERS-CoV can alter antigen presentation, host immune response and modulate the apoptotic pathways and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways [7] .

Before the discovery of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV was considered the most pathogenic coronavirus. However, the higher pathogenicity of MERS-CoV was apparent by the higher number of deaths caused by this virus. Similar to the virus of SARS, MERS-CoV infects and replicates in the human airway epithelial cells and suppresses the production of interferons [31, 32] . However, unlike SARS-CoV, the MERS virus exhibits wider tissue tropism [33, 34] . MERS-CoV can also induce pro-inflammatory cytokines but lacks in production of innate antiviral cytokines compared with SARS-CoV. Suggesting MERS-CoV induces delayed pro-inflammatory response and attenuates innate immunity, which suggests that MERS-CoV is more lethal compared with SARS-CoV [35] [36] [37] . Primarily the MERS virus interacts with the host DPP4 receptor through its spike (S) protein after entering the respiratory tract. DPP4 receptors are present on the epithelial surface of various human organs such as, the lungs, kidneys, liver, bone marrow, thymus and intestines [38] . The systemic distribution of DPP4 facilitates the dissemination of virus in the human body. Expression of DPP4 on the respiratory tract is mainly on type I and type II pneumocytes, endothelial cells, nonciliated bronchial epithelial cells and a few forms of hematopoietic cells [39, 40] . The abundance of the receptor DPP4 is greater on the epithelial cells lining the lower airways and alveoli and lesser on the epithelial surface of upper conducting airways and nasal cavity [41] . Recent findings have suggested that a prior existing pulmonary ailment might increase the chances of such individuals contracting MERS, as chronic pulmonary diseases results in enhanced DPP4 expression [40] .

CoV nsp1 is a serious virulence factor, which facilitates the biological actions of MERS-CoV. Studying the nsp1 can advance our understanding of pathogenicity of MERS-CoV and facilitate development of better therapeutics. Host gene expression in infected cells is suppressed by MERS-CoV nsp1, which also promotes virus assembly or budding in in vitro, leading to efficient virus replication, suggesting nsp1 is also critical for MERS-CoV replication and promotes production of virus particles in the host [42] . The severity of MERS-CoV infection is relatively more in patients with co-morbid conditions, such as chronic lung disease, renal failure, diabetes and others with compromised immune systems [9] .

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was identified as a zoonotic virus, whose mode of transmission is from animals to humans. The origin of the virus is believed to be bats, from which it was then transferred to camels. Camels are currently regarded as a major host for MERS-CoV. It has also been identified as the most significant source for human infections [1] . The isolates of MERS-CoV from camels and humans have also been found to more than 99% identical [2] . While camels have been identified as the primary source of MERS-CoV infection through both indirect as well as direct contact, the specific route and role of camels in disease transmission is yet to be identified.

The pathogenic agent of Middle East respiratory syndrome is a new coronavirus which was initially identified from the respiratory content of a patient who was infected, and died, as a result of infection from a mysterious viral disease showing pneumonia like symptoms in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [3] . Initially, a group of healthcare personnel working in a hospital in Jordan contracted a respiratory infection in April 2012, the source of which was not known [4] . Later in June 2012, an elderly businessman with severe pneumonia associated with kidney failure was admitted to a Saudi hospital. The coronavirus detected from his sputum was not known before and for a while [15] .

it was referred to as human Coronavirus Erasmus Medical Center (hCoV-EMC) [5] . Following that case, another patient from the Middle East with severe respiratory infection, who was transferred to the UK, was found to be infected with the same virus. On analyzing and comparing the samples from the Jordan outbreak with the latter ones, the same virus hCoV-EMC was recognized as causing this new and severe form of respiratory infection. It was later titled as MERS-CoV [6] . Since its first detection to this date, this virus has spread in countries across Middle East and Europe [7] . The highest number of cases has been identified in Saudi Arabia. Infections in European countries have been brought in by travel from the Middle East [7, 8] . From 2012 through the end of December 2018, the number of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV globally reported to the WHO was 2279 with 806 associated deaths, which corresponds to a fatality rate of approximately 35.36%. Saudi Arabia was on the top of the list of countries with 1901 reports of confirmed cases, including 732 related deaths with a fatality rate of approximately 39% [9] . Due to its high mortality rate (∼36%) [9, 10] and pathogenicity, nonavailability of vaccine or any other definite treatment, MERS-CoV is considered a major challenge to global health and presents a pressing need for the research and development of definite therapeutic options and adequate management to prevent its infection [11, 12] .

The interest in coronaviruses was reignited after the 2002 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 2012 outbreak of MERS-CoV. Researchers have tried to understand pandemic potential of MERS-CoV by studying its emergence and ecology. Studies are being carrying out to assess how this virus causes disease so that novel therapeutics and vaccines can be developed. The mode of transmission of MERS-CoV is yet to be established, but it is assumed to have come from bats [13] . Camels found in the Arabian Peninsula may serve as intermediate hosts for human infection [14] . This review will focus on studies trying to elucidate mechanisms by which MERS-CoV escapes host-immune system and causes disease. We will also examine the recent advances in the development of novel therapeutics and vaccines. Figure 1 vitro studies. Studies were conducted on animal models and human lung cell lines, and the account from a single autopsy [43] . In vitro studies revealed that MERS-CoV can easily replicate in several cultured human cells, as well as, in the differentiated and nondifferentiated human epithelial cells [34, 44] . The antigens of MERS-CoV were found on the macrophages in the alveoli of the infected human lung explants, ciliated and nonciliated bronchial epithelial cells, endothelial cells and pneumocytes [33, 45] . These findings were in sync with the findings made in the single autopsy where MERS-CoV antigen was detected on pneumocytes, endothelial cells and epithelial cells of the airways and few on macrophages [43, 45] . Macrophages are the important phagocytic cells of innate immune system which help remove the pathogenic substances from the body and present their antigens to the T cells. The cytokines as well as chemokines produced by the macrophages help in destroying the pathogens, adjusting the immune system and maintaining tissue homoeostasis [46] . However, in MERS, the virus-infected macrophages contribute considerably to the development of disease symptoms [47] . The infection with MERS-CoV of human epithelial cells induces the release of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines from the monocyte-derived macrophages. It is believed that these chemokines/cytokines cause inflammatory changes and tissue injury through infiltration of immune cells in the lower respiratory tract [47] . The patients suffering from MERS clinically manifest pneumonia, which is progressive in nature and has a large number of macrophages and neutrophils found in the fluids present in the lungs [3, 48] . Studies conducted on rhesus macaques have shown the lung tissue infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils on MERS-CoV infection, though their respiratory symptoms were milder as compared with humans [49] . Many scientists believe that this sequestration of immune cells contribute to the development of lymphopenia seen in patients with MERS. The progress in the severity of pneumonia and respiratory dysfunction in the MERS patients is also attributed to cytokine/chemokine induction [30, 50] . Zhou et al. found that MERS-CoV can efficiently replicate inside macrophages and, hence, can overcome the host immune system. [47] . Thus, these phagocytes act like reservoirs and means of transportation for these viruses, helping to replicate and disseminate, such as the HIV virus [51] .

Infection of epithelial cells with the MERS virus induce slow, but significant, IFN type I and II responses [36] . Macrophages release pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8 upon MERS-CoV infection [37] . Similarly, MERS-CoV infection in blood monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells leads to the release of chemokines and cytokines, for example, IL-2, IL-3, CCL-2, CCL-3 and RANTES [37, 48] . Infection of activated T cells induces apoptosis via different pathways which may also explain the occurrence of lymphopenia [52] . With the present available knowledge, it is difficult to describe the exact pathogenesis of MERS-CoV, but it seems that viral replication in the macrophages results in extreme cytotoxicity and triggers the induction of pro-inflammatory chemicals which may lead to MERS-associated complications.

A small number of epithelial, pneumocytes, lymphoid aggregates and inflammatory cells of submucosal glands were positive for MERS spike protein in nonhuman primates (NHPs). Whereas, MERS spike antigen were positive in epithelial layers of submucosal bronchial glands, lungs of NHPs and in some cells in BALTs [53] . Dual Immunohistochemistry method was applied using monoclonal antibody against MERS spike protein and CD26, the staining showed that MERS was found in CD26 positive cells but were negative in NHPs [53] .

Two NHPs, the common marmoset and rhesus macaque model were established for MERS-CoV infection by three different research groups [49, [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] . The clinical symptoms included respiratory disease which was mild in nature and could be diagnosed with radio imaging and computed tomography [54, 56, 59] and respiratory disease of severe nature showing fatal clinical symptoms requiring euthanasia [54, 59] . Exposure to the MERS-0 infectious clone (icMERS-0) strain in Rhesus monkeys is reported to cause respiratory disease, wherein virus antigen has been detected. Respiratory disease in such cases was found to be transient and mild in nature, which resolved by 30 days from infection. Pulmonary disease was also found to be mild upon MERS-CoV infection in NHPs. Earlier studies found ocular, intratracheal or intranasal exposure of MERS-EMC isolate to cause lethal disease. However, it has been argued that lethality was due to manipulations of marmoset, which have higher sensitivity than macaque species [54, 57] . Cases of mild to moderate symptoms even after higher viral titer have also been reported in other studies [56] . Small animals, such as hamsters and mice, have been found to be resistant to MERS-CoV infection and development of models of severe respiratory disease has been a challenge [60] .

The identification of highly pathogenic MERS-CoV suggests that coronaviruses present an incessant and long-term hazard to humans. Development of effective therapeutic and prophylactic agents to contain their infections is an urgent need, and yet currently no antiviral treatments against MERS-CoV are available. MERS-CoV is known to interact with host cell surface receptor DPP4 or CD26 with its spike S protein, which subsequently leads to its entry in the host cell [61] . Our knowledge regarding the exact mechanisms that follow thereafter is still limited and requires more research. Due to lack of definite treatment, supportive therapy remains the only solution. Present development consists of the previous experiences of other coronavirus diseases like SARS-CoV, which have been studied in in vitro and in vivo models. Tremendous efforts are being made in this direction and various antiviral and related therapies have been identified. Use of humanized monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma and therapeutic peptides has been shown efficacious. Repurposing of the currently available drugs is also being tried to extend their efficacy against MERS-CoV. Some potential options are discussed in detail below.

The concept of using clinically available drugs to treat new diseases is known as repurposing. In this method, a new target profile is created for the existing drugs through screening of large molecular databases. Owing to advances in computational approaches and development of effective antiviral agents, repurposing has become faster. Using high-throughput screening, researchers have been able to screen large libraries of drugs against novel targets and evaluate their antiviral activity in vitro [62, 63] . Some of repurposed drugs have shown potent antiviral activity against MERS-CoV, for example, ribavirin, nitazoxanide and hexachloropene [64] . Some other studies have repurposed the drugs by using a combination of two or more existing drugs. Wilde et al. combined alisporivir with ribavirin for enhanced antiviral activity against MERS and SARs-CoV [65] . In another study on MERS-CoV infected marmosets, hybrid of ritonavir/lopinavir and IFN-β1b had positive effect [66] .

Convalescent plasma therapy utilizes plasma or whole blood from people who have been infected with viral diseases and recovered. This therapy has been used during outbreaks when no particular medicines or vaccines are available for treatment [67] . The use of convalescent plasma has been indicated to be an efficient therapeutic strategy for diseases like MERS-CoV [68] . Studies have been carried out to confirm its feasibility and safety in treating MERS; however, the data are insufficient. There are a few drawbacks of this therapy, as often large-scale screening is required to obtain sufficient amount of antibodies from potential donors [69] .

Monoclonal antibodies have been commonly used in the diagnosis of various diseases. Therapeutics based on monoclonal antibodies have been used successfully in the therapy of various diseases [70, 71] . The potential of this approach was acknowledged against coronaviruses during the SARS outbreak [72, 73] . And when the other deadly coronavirus attacked humans, this previous knowledge helped greatly in the improving the response against the risk of MERS-CoV.

Initial studies suggested that MERS-CoV RBD domain in S1 glycoprotein represents a suitable target for the development of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies [62, [74] [75] [76] . Hence, the idea to develop neutralizing mouse mAbs as a strategy to prevent the entry of MERS-CoV into host cells was led by Du et al. [75] . mAbs were made by vaccinating mice with IgG1 Fc to which recombinant MERS-CoV S1 was fused [75] . Consequently, Mersmab1, the most effective murine mAb was developed that targeted MERS-CoV RBD, and successfully neutralized MERS-CoV infection in Vero E6, Huh-7 and Calu-3 cells [76] . These studies indicated the potential of humanized mAbs as efficient curative agents against infection caused by MERS-CoV. Around April 2014, three independent studies first reported to have developed complete humanized MERS-CoV neutralizing mAbs [77, 78] . All these humanized mAbs specifically targeted the MERS-CoV RBD glycoprotein. The efficacy of human mAbs against MERS-CoV infection was first exhibited by Qiu et al. [79] . They were able to completely treat MERS-CoV infection of lethal nature with a single dose of humanized mAbs in the hDPP4 transgenic mouse [79] .

Development of humanized monoclonal antibodies against emerging viral diseases requires a significant production cost and poses as a major drawback. To overcome this obstacle and to reduce the cost, extremely powerful neutralizing mAbs which can be given in smaller doses without compromising the efficacy is needed. One strategy to achieve this could be to design humanized mAbs with exceptional binding attraction and targeting them against the potential targets, such as RBD.

Recently, interest has been generated in the development of peptide therapeutics as potential drug targets for different pathogens. Currently, more than 140 peptide therapeutics are lined up for clinical evaluation presenting peptide research as a component of pharmaceutical research [80] . As compared with chemical drugs, peptide drugs show high specificity toward the target as well as little side effect and drug tolerance [19] . Many peptide therapeutics have shown positive results against viral infections, for instance RVFV-6 peptide against rift valley fever virus and Kn2-7 peptide derived from scorpion venom against HIV-1 [81] [82] [83] . Antimicrobial peptides are cited as potential novel antiviral therapeutics against coronaviruses [84] . Antimicrobial peptides are produced by host immune system upon initial exposure to pathogens. These are gene encoded and positively charged peptides that are selectively toxic against their targets [85, 86] . This selectivity is due to their positive charge which attacks the negatively charged membrane bilayer of microbes [87] . The antimicrobial peptides block the receptors present on the host cell's surface, which in turn inhibit different steps of viral fusion and replication causing virolysis and activation of host's adaptive immune response [88] .

Since the emergence of MERS-CoV, research has greatly enhanced our knowledge of the pathogenesis caused by it and other contemporary coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV. The efforts toward development of vaccines against this deadly virus have also been continuously increasing leading to the emergence of promising interventions. The two viruses, in other words, SARS and MERS have some common challenges in the development of an efficacious vaccine. As evident from reports, the aged population is more vulnerable to MERS-CoV. The lesson learnt from preclinical studies of SARS-CoV suggests that vaccines fail to protect aged animals, while being effective in young ones. Similarly, in clinical settings, the risk of mortality is even higher in individuals with chronic conditions or an immunocompromised state. An effective vaccine, thus, should offer universal protection, including the vulnerable populations. To do so, there is a need to evaluate the promising vaccines in the comorbid chronic conditions and the immunocompromised rodent models. Since the virus can comfortably replicate in macrophages, the risk of vaccine-derived immunopathology cannot be negated and must be considered using heterologous challenge models. Further, balance must be struck between protection and excessive immune activation while evaluating a successful vaccine candidate. The vaccine development against MERS-CoV is mostly influenced by the SARS-CoV. However, to aid the development of better vaccines, there is need to further enhance the knowledge of pathology of MERS-CoV and outline critical differences between SARS and MERS-CoV. mAbs offers a window of opportunity, as a few candidates have shown potency in in vitro testing. However, care needs to be taken in humanizing mAbs so as to minimize the antimouse antibody response. Epitopes identified from mouse neutralizing mAbs can be neutralized for humanizing MERS-CoV. mAbs targeting RBD are reported to have higher potency than therapies directed against other S protein regions of MERS-CoV, as these could recognize critical residues for DPP4 binding. However, changes in such critical residues may render these mAbs ineffective and lead to development of escape mutant strains of the virus. As discussed, a few promising peptides have also been developed against MERS-CoV. The antiviral activity, stability and solubility of these peptides can be further improved similar to the peptides developed against HIV. This will lead to the development of optimized next generation peptides having better inhibitory action directed against MERS-CoV. Alternatively, as a novel approach, the peptide inhibitors can be combined with mAbs (e.g., RBD specific). The combination can be evaluated for the synergistic effect against divergent and resistant strains. Studies are also needed to explore novel delivery technologies and optimizing vaccine immunity with a suitable combination of adjuvants. In summary, there have been encouraging results in the area of the development of MERS-CoV vaccines in preclinical settings. However, there are challenges related to efficacy, safety and drug delivery that need further consideration before proceeding to clinical trials. Focused research in this direction can help reduce the disease burden caused by MERS-CoV and prevent outbreaks, especially among the aged and immunocompromised population.

Human Enterovirus 68 Interferes with the Host Cell Cycle to Facilitate Viral Production

Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is an emerging pathogen that recently caused a large outbreak of severe respiratory disease in the United States and other countries. Little is known about the relationship between EV-D68 virus and host cells. In this study, we assessed the effect of the host cell cycle on EV-D68 viral production, as well as the ability of EV-D68 to manipulate host cell cycle progression. The results suggest that synchronization in G0/G1 phase, but not S phase, promotes viral production, while synchronization in G2/M inhibits viral production. Both an early EV-D68 isolate and currently circulating strains of EV-D68 can manipulate the host cell cycle to arrest cells in the G0/G1 phase, thus providing favorable conditions for virus production. Cell cycle regulation by EV-D68 was associated with corresponding effects on the expression of cyclins and CDKs, which were observed at the level of the protein and/or mRNA. Furthermore, the viral non-structural protein 3D of EV-D68 prevents progression from G0/G1 to S. Interestingly, another member of the Picornaviridae family, EV-A71, differs from EV-D68 in that G0/G1 synchronization inhibits, rather than promotes, EV-A71 viral replication. However, these viruses are similar in that G2/M synchronization inhibits the production and activity of both viruses, which is suggestive of a common therapeutic target for both types of enterovirus. These results further clarify the pathogenic mechanisms of enteroviruses and provide a potential strategy for the treatment and prevention of EV-D68-related disease.

Human enterovirus 68 (EV-D68) is an emerging pathogen that can cause severe respiratory disease and is associated with cases of paralysis, especially among children. It was first isolated from samples obtained in California in 1962 from four children with pneumonia and bronchiolitis (Schieble et al., 1967) . Over the past 10 years, EV-D68 infection outbreaks have been reported in Italy, the United States, Germany, China, and several other countries (Esposito et al., 2015; Farrell et al., 2015; Reiche et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015) , with a record number of confirmed cases in 2014 (http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/ev-d68.html). Unfortunately, no vaccines for prevention or medicines for treatment are currently available for future outbreaks, mainly due to the fact that information on host factors required for EV-D68 replication is scarce. EV-D68 belong to enterovirus (family Picornaviridae, genus Enterovirus), which are non-enveloped, positive-sense singlestrand RNA viruses of approximately 7500 nt and contain a large open reading frame that encodes a polyprotein that is cleaved to yield corresponding viral proteins. Based on the molecular and biological characteristics, four human enterovirus (HEV) species are currently designated as HEV-A, -B, -C, and -D (Oberste et al., 1999a,b) . The representative of HEV-A serotype is human enterovirus 71 (EV-A71), which is a primary causative agent for Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) that is associated with the recent outbreaks in Asia (Liu et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012) . EV-D68 is assigned to HEV-D serotype, but EV-D68 is unlike other enteroviruses in that it is acid labile and biologically more similar to human rhinoviruses that are associated with respiratory diseases (Smura et al., 2010) .

As a feature of their pathogenic mechanism, many viruses facilitate their own replication by interacting with host factors that regulate cell cycle progression. Examples can be discovered in DNA viruses, retroviruses and RNA viruses. DNA viruses, which replicate in the nucleus, have been extensively investigated in regard to control the cell cycle of host cells. For example, some small DNA viruses including simian virus 40 (DeCaprio et al., 1988) , adenovirus (Howe et al., 1990; Eckner et al., 1994) , and human papillomavirus (Werness et al., 1990) , which lack their own polymerases, use the host polymerase to promote the entry of cells into S phase from G0/G1 phase. For other large DNA viruses, for example, herpesviruses can induce G0/G1 arrest in order to avoid competing for cellular DNA replication resources (Flemington, 2001) . Cell cycle regulation also has been observed for retroviruses, which, like DNA viruses, replicate in the nucleus. The Vpr protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is responsible for eliciting cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase (He et al., 1995; Goh et al., 1998) . Furthermore, RNA viruses, whose primary site of replication is normally the cytoplasm, have also been demonstrated to interfere with the host cell cycle. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) induces an S and G2/M-phase arrest to favor viral replication (Dove et al., 2006; Li et al., 2007) , and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Chen and Makino, 2004) and some severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) proteins induce cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase (Yuan et al., 2005 (Yuan et al., , 2006 . In a previous study, we found that human EV-A71 and Coxsackievirus A16, manipulate the host cell cycle at S phase in order to promote their own viral replication (Yu et al., 2015) ; however, the potential manipulation of the host cell cycle by EV-D68, which is associated with higher lethality in recent large-scale outbreaks, has not been previously characterized.

In the current study, we examined the effects of the cell cycle status on EV-D68 viral replication, as well as the impact of EV-D68 virus on the host cell cycle. Our data show that EV-D68 replication is integrally associated with the host cell cycle, though the pattern of regulation differs distinctly from that of EV-A71. These results further increase the understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of enteroviruses and provide a potential target for the treatment and prevention of enterovirus-related diseases.

The Fermon (ATCC, VR-1826), US/KY/14-18953 (ATCC, VR-1825D), and US/MO/14-18947 (ATCC, VR-1823D) strains of EV-D68; and the Changchun077 strain of EV-A71 have been reported previously (Wang et al., 2012) . Viruses were propagated in human rhabdomyosarcoma , and the supernatants were harvested and stored at −80 • C. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293T cells) (No CRL-11268) and RD cells were purchased from the ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and used according to a previous study . Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (GIBCO BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA).

The viral titers were determined by measuring the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) in a microtitration assay using RD cells, as described (Gay et al., 2006) . RD cells were seeded and incubated at 37 • C for 24 h in 96-well plates. Viruscontaining supernatant was serially diluted 10-fold, and 100 µl of diluent virus was added per well in octuplicate. Until the experimental endpoint was reached the cytopathic effect was observed once per day. According to the Reed-Muench method (Reed, 1983 ) the viral titers of the TCID50 were determined, based on the assumption that material with 1 × 10 5 TCID50/ml will produce 0.7 × 10 5 plaque forming units/ml (www.protocol-online.org/biology-forums/posts/1664.html).

Cells were mock-infected or infected with EV-D68 or EV-A71 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.8. After 2 h of virus adsorption, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) one time, then added fresh culture medium.

Subconfluent cultures of RD cells were synchronized in G0/G1 phase by serum deprivation (He et al., 2010) . Approximately 5 × 10 5 cells were plated in a 6-well plate and maintained in serumfree medium for 24 h. After EV-D68 virus infection, fresh 10% DMEM was added to release the cells from G0/G1.

In order to observe the effects of the cell cycle on virus growth, subconfluent cultures of RD cells were synchronized in G0/G1 phase by serum deprivation for 24 h (He et al., 2010) . For S-phase synchronization, a final concentration of 0.85 mM thymidine (Sigma) were added (Helt and Harris, 2005; Yu et al., 2015) for 24 h. For G2/M synchronization, 25 ng/ml of nocodazole (Sigma) was added (He et al., 1995; Yu et al., 2015) for 24 h. For sustained S and G2/M cell-cycle arrest after virus infection, cells were treated with fresh 0.85 mM thymidine and 25 ng/ml nocodazole for the indicated times.

Propidium iodide (PI) staining was used to measure the nuclear DNA content according to previous study (Yu et al., 2015) . Firstly, the cells were collected and fixed with 1 ml of cold 70% ethanol at 4 • C overnight and then re-suspended in PI staining buffer (50 µg/ml PI (Sigma), 20 µg/ml RNase in PBS) for 2 h at 4 • C. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACScan; BD) were used to analyze the PI-stained cells, and at least 10,000 cells were counted for each sample. ModFit LT, version 2.0 (Verity Software House) was performed for data analysis.

Virus-infected or mock-infected cells were collected at various times after EV-D68 infection and washed once with PBS as previously described (Yu et al.) . The following antibodies were used in Western blot analyses: anti-CDK2 (Cell Signal), anti-cyclinE1 (Proteintech), anti-CDK4 (Cell Signal), anti-CDK6 (Cell Signal), anti-cyclinD (Cell Signal), anti-CDK1 (Boster), anti-cyclinB1 (Santa Cruz), and anti-histone (GenScript). Secondary antibodies from mouse or rabbit were obtained from Jackson Immuno Research.

All work was carried out in a designated PCR-clean area as previously described (Yu et al.) . RNA was extracted from infected and uninfected cells using Trizol reagent (Gibco-BRL, Rockville, Md.) and isolated as specified by the manufacturer. The RNA was DNAse-treated (DNase I-RNase-Free, Ambion) to remove any contaminating DNA; 200 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with oligo dT primers using the High Capacity cDNA RT Kit (Applied Biosystems) in a 20 µl cDNA reaction, as specified by the manufacturer. For quantitative PCR, the template cDNA was added to a 20 µl reaction with SYBR GREEN PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 0.2 µM of primer ( Table 1) . The amplification was carried out using an ABI Prism 7000 for 40 cycles under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95 • C for 10 min; 40 cycles of 95 • C for 15 s and 60 • C for 1 min. The fold changes were calculated relative to GAPDH using the Ct method.

The cell lysates were examined for CDK4, CDK6, cyclinD1, CDK2, cyclinE1, CDK1, cyclinB1 and histone with ELISA kits (Meiyan, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The microplate was quantified using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Target protein expression was normalized to the histone expression.

Statistical differences were analyzed using the Student's t-test for all analysis, except of 3C and 3D dose-dependent test in Figures 4B,D with Pearson correlation coefficient. Data are presented as means and standard deviations (SD). * P-values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org

Viral replication often is integrally associated with the cell cycle status of host cells (Feuer et al., 2002) . To explore the possible benefits of different cell cycle phases for EV-D68 viral replication, we synchronized cells in different phases and then assessed viral replication and virulence. First, we assessed the effects of G0/G1 synchronization by serum deprivation (Darzynkiewicz et al., 1980) . RD cells were cultured in either serum medium (control) or serum-free medium (G0/G1 synchronization) for 24 h. Then the cells were infected with the same titer of 0.8 MOI of EV-D68 (Fermon strain) or were mock-infected for 2 h, and either serum medium or serum-free medium was added for another 24 h ( Figure 1A ). As previously reported (He et al., 2010) , serum deprivation induced obvious G0/G1 arrest as assessed by flow cytometry (P < 0.001; Figure 1B ). At 2 h post-infection (viral entry stage), the EV-D68 genomic RNA levels were not significantly different in the control and serumstarved cells ( Figure 1M) ; however, at 18 h post infection (viral replication stage) 13.55 times more viral RNA was detected in the serum-starved cells than in the control cells (P < 0.01; Figure 1C ). Furthermore, at 24 h (viral production stage) the TCID50/mL of infectious EV-D68 particles was 348.84 times higher for supernatant from G0/G1 phase-synchronized cells (202.17 ± 42.60 × 10 5 ) than for supernatant from control cells (0.59 ± 0.08 × 10 5 ) (P < 0.01; Figure 1D ). These results suggest that G0/G1-phase arrest does not affect viral entry, but promotes EV-D68 viral replication and production.

To determine whether viral replication and production also is elevated at other phases of the cell cycle, the effect of S phase synchronization was assessed. The cells were cultured in medium or were synchronized in S phase by culture with 0.85 mM thymidine for 24 h. Then, the cells were mock infected or were infected with 0.8 MOI of EV-D68 for 2 h, and fresh culture medium or 0.85 mM thymidine was added for another 24 h ( Figure 1E ). Thymidine induced obvious S phase arrest (P < 0.001; Figure 1F) . The genomic RNA level remained similar in S phase-synchronized cells and control non-synchronized cells at 2 h post-infection ( Figure 1M ) and at 24 h post-infection (P > 0.05; Figure 1G ). Furthermore, the TCID50/mL values at 24 h post-infection were equivalent for the S phase-synchronized cell supernatant (2.59 ± 1.37 × 10 5 ) and the control cell supernatant (3.28 ± 1.80 × 10 5 ) (P > 0.05; Figure 1H ). These results suggest that S-phase arrest does not affect EV-D68 viral entry, replication or production.

To assess the effects of G2/M phase synchronization, cells were cultured in medium or were treated with 25 ng/ml nocodazole for 24 h; then, the cells were mock infected or were infected with EV-D68 at 0.8 MOI for 2 h, and cultured in fresh medium or 25 ng/ml nocodazole for another 24 h ( Figure 1I ). Nododazole induced obvious G2/M arrest (P < 0.001; Figure 1J ). At 2 h post-infection, there was no significant difference in the genomic RNA level in the control and G2/M phase-synchronized cells ( Figure 1M) ; however, at 24 h post-infection the genomic level was lower in the synchronized cells than in the control cells (P < 0.05; Figure 1K ). Furthermore, at 24 h post-infection the TCID50/mL for supernatant from the G2/M phase-synchronized cells (0.46 ± 0.29 × 10 5 ) was obviously lower than that from the control cells (1.40 ± 0.16 × 10 5 ) (P < 0.01; Figure 1L ). Therefore, these results suggest that G2/M synchronization does not affect viral entry, but inhibits EV-D68 viral replication and production.

Given that EV-D68 replication and production is dependent on the cell cycle, we next asked whether EV-D68 might have the ability to manipulate the host cell cycle to facilitate its own production. RD cells were infected with EV-D68 Fermon stain at an MOI of 0.8, and the cells were collected for cell cycle distribution analysis after 24 h. An obvious increase in the percentage of cells in G0/G1 was observed in EV-D68-infected cells (45.20 ± 0.14%) as compared to mock-infected cells (36.50 ± 0.76%) (23.84% increase; P < 0.01; Figure 2A ). Therefore, EV-D68 itself can manipulate the host cell to accumulate preferentially at G0/G1 phase rather than at G2/M, which favors viral production.

Though the latter experiments were performed using the Fermon strain of EV-D68, which was isolated from 4 children with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in the United States in 1962 (Schieble et al., 1967; Zhang et al., 2015) , several more recent strains of the virus have been isolated. The currently circulating EV-D68 US/MO/14-18947 and US/KY/14-18953 strains are similar to the Fermon strain in clinical characteristics and genome structure, but it is not known whether they are similar in virulence and ability to manipulate the cell cycle. Therefore, we compared the US/MO/14-18947 and US/KY/14-18953 strains to the Fermon strain. Under normal culture conditions, RD cells were infected with three strains virus at an MOI of 0.8 for 24 h, respectively, the TCID50/mL of the US/MO/14-18947 strain (43.07 ± 10.22 × 10 5 ) was 29.76 times higher and the TCID50/mL of the US/KY/14-18953 (195.00 ± 54.03 × 10 5 ) was 138.29 higher than the TCID50/mL of the Fermon strain (1.40 ± 0.16 × 10 5 ) ( Figure 2B) . These results suggest that the EV-D68 virulence has increased over time, which could explain the recent rise in the incidence of Enterovirus-related disease (Esposito et al., 2015; Farrell et al., 2015; Reiche et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015) .

Next, we assessed the cell cycle distribution after RD cells were infected with the currently circulating strains of EV-D68 at an MOI of 0.8 for 24 h. An obvious increase in the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase was observed for both US/MO/14-18947 (25.83% increase; P < 0.01) ( Figure 2C ) and US/KY/14-18953 (10.85% increase; P < 0.01) ( Figure 2D ). These strains also caused a corresponding increase in the ratio of cells in G0/G1-G2/M (53.54% increase for US/MO/14-18947; 85.91% increase US/KY/14-18953; P < 0.001; Figures 2C,D) . Therefore, the currently circulating strains possess increased virulence and a similar ability as the Fermon strain to skew the cell cycle toward the G0/G1 phase, which facilitates viral production. 

To further understand the mechanism of EV-D68 manipulation of the host cell cycle, we assessed whether EV-D68 could regulate cell cycle exit from G0/G1 into S phase. RD cells were synchronized in G0/G1 by serum starvation for 24 h, and then mock-infected or infected with EV-D68 Fermon strain for 2 h. The cells were then stimulated with 10% FBS in order to trigger cell cycle re-entry into S phase from G0/G1. At 24 h of mitogenic stimulation with serum, the mock-infected cells progressed synchronously from G0/G1 into S phase. In contrast, the majority of the EV-D68-infected RD cells remained in G0/G1 phase over the 24 h time period without S entry (P < 0.001; Figure 3A) . Therefore, these results support a model in which EV-D68 infection regulates the cell cycle by preventing entry into the S phase.

Cyclin/CDK complexes are known to regulate cell cycle progression (Sherr, 1994) . To identify the key molecules and signaling pathways that may mediate the inhibition of cell entry into S phase by EV-D68, we examined the protein expression profiles of host G0/G1-phase and S-phase proteins by Western blotting of RD cells at 0, 16, 20, 24, and 28 h post-infection. Among the molecules CDK4, CDK6, and cyclinD (which mediate cell cycle progression in G0/G1; Massagué, 2004) and CDK2 and cyclinE1 (which mediate cell cycle transition from G0/G1 to S phase; Hinds et al., 1992) , the expression of CDK6 was not changed, and the expression of cyclinE1 was increased at 24 h post-infecion (Figure 3B) , while all of them were significantly decreased in virus-infected cells as compared to mock-infected cells at 28 h post-infection (Figures 3B,G) . Furthermore, the CDK2 mRNA level was decreased by EV-D68 infection; however, there were no significant differences between the virus and mockinfected groups in CDK4, CDK6, cyclinD or cyclinE1 mRNA levels ( Figure 3C) . Therefore, EV-D68 infection inhibits host expression of several cell cycle proteins, which is consistent with its ability to inhibit G0/G1 to S phase entry, and the modulation is likely to occur transcriptionally for CDK2 and post-transcriptionally for CDK4, CDK6, cyclinD, and cyclinE1.

To further examine the potential effect of virus infection on cell cycle transition from G2/M phase into G0/G1, RD cells were treated with 25 ng/ml nocodazole or medium for 24 h for G2/M phase synchronization and then the cells were mock infected or infected with EV-D68 at 0.8 MOI for 2 h. Next, the cells were treated for an additional 24 h with 25 ng/ml nocodazole or fresh medium. Nocodazole induced obvious G2/M cell cycle arrest (35.91 ± 1.44 vs. 18.77 ± 0.20%; P < 0.01); however, after EV-D68 infection for 24 h, the percentage of cells in G2/M was decreased (21.82 ± 1.07 vs. 35.91 ± 1.44; P < 0.001), and the percentage of cells in G0/G1 was increased (48.59 ± 1.22 vs. 32.51 ± 0.21; P < 0.01) ( Figure 3D) . Therefore, EV-D68 infection also regulates the cell cycle by promoting exit from G2/M phase. Consistent with these findings, the expression of cyclinB1 and CDK1 (which mediate G2/M progression; Coverley et al., 2002; Yam et al., 2002) was down regulated by EV-D68 infection (Figures 3E,G) . CDK1 was decreased at the mRNA level upon EV-D68 infection (transition fromP < 0.01), but cyclinB1 mRNA expression was not significantly regulated ( Figure 3F) . Therefore, EV-D68 virus promotes cell cycle exit from G2/M and entry into G0/G1 by modifying the pathway of G0/G1 entry at the transcriptional level for CDK1 and at the post-translational level for cyclinB1.

A previous study concluded that exogenous expression of EV-A71 viral non-structural 3D protein, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, mediates cell cycle arrest at S phase (Yu et al.) . Given this finding, we examined whether non-structural 3D protein of EV-D68 had the same ability to mediate cell cycle alteration. Transfection of 3D expression vector (2 µg) induced G0/G1 arrest, with an increase in the percentage of G0/G1 cells from 39.37 ± 0.52% to 44.76 ± 1.29% (13.69% increase; P < 0.01) and a corresponding increase in the G0/G1-G2/M ratio from 2.02 ± 0.04 to 2.62 ± 0.18 (29.70% increase; P < 0.01) ( Figure 4A) . Furthermore, the extent of the increase in the percentage of G0/G1 cells was dependent on the dose of 3D vector (0, 0.5, 1, 2 µg; R = 0.932; P < 0.001), and the G0/G1 to G2/M ratio also depended on the dose of 3D vector (R = 0.827; P < 0.001; Figure 4B ). These results suggest that the non-structural protein 3D of EV-D68 contributes to G0/G1 arrest.

Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org We also examined the potential role of non-structural protein 3C in cell cycle regulation by EV-D68. Transfection of high dose 3C expression vector (2µg) decreased the percentage of cells in G2/M phase from 19.53 ± 0.26% to 13.19 ± 0.48% (32.46% decrease) and increased in the ratio of cells in G0/G1 to G2/M from 2.01 ± 0.04 to 2.75 ± 0.17 (36.82% increase; P < 0.01) (Figure 4C) . High dose 3C transfection also increased the percentage of cells in S phase (from 41.10 ± 0.48% to 50.53 ± 0.73%). Although the change in the cell cycle profile was not dose-dependent, the G0/G1 to G2/M ratio was dose-dependent (R = 0.951; P < 0.001; Figure 4D ). These results suggest that the non-structural protein 3C may contribute to the enhanced cell cycle exit from G2/M phase after EV-D68 infection.

To verify these findings and to evaluate the mechanism of cell cycle regulation after 3D and 3C transfection, we performed Western blotting assays to examine their effect on the expression of cycle-related proteins. Consistent with the cell cycle analyses, 3D down-regulated the expression of cyclinD, CDK4, CDK2, and cyclinE1 (Figure 4E) , while 3C down-regulated the expression of CDK1 and cyclinB1 ( Figure 4F) . Therefore the non-structural protein 3C facilitates exit from G2/M and the non-structural protein 3D mediates arrest in G0/G1 ( Figure 4G ).

EV-D68 (serotype HEV-D) and EV-A71 (serotype HEV-A) are both enteroviruses. We have demonstrated that G0/G1 synchronization promotes EV-D68 viral replication ( Figures 1A-D) . However, in our previous study, we determined that G0/G1 synchronization inhibits EV-A71 viral replication. To exclude experimental variation as an explanation for the disparate responses of these viruses to G0/G1 synchronization, we performed a side-by-side comparison of the two enteroviruses. Our results confirm that no serum treatment induces G0/G1 synchronization (Figures 5A,B) and G0/G1 synchronization has opposite effects for the two viruses ( Figure 5) . After 18 h infection with EV-D68, the viral genomic mRNA level was 13.55 times higher in serum-starved cells than in control cells (P < 0.01; Figure 5C ); however, after 18 h infection with EV-A71, the viral genomic mRNA level was 3.12 times lower in serum-starved cells (P < 0.05; Figure 5D ). Furthermore, after 24 h infection, the TCID50/mL for EVD68 was 341.66 times higher for G0/G1 phase-synchronized cells The results were standardized using GAPDH mRNA as a control and normalized to 1.0 in mock-infected cells. (E,F) At 24 h post-infection, The TCID50/mL was shown through titrating the progeny viruses of EV-D68 or EV-A71 in the supernatants with RD cells. The results represent the mean ± S.D of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001. than for control cells (202.17 ± 42.60 × 10 5 vs. 0.59 ± 0.08 × 10 5 ; P < 0.01; Figure 5E ), while the TCID50/mL for EV-A71 was 489.37 times lower for G0/G1 phase-synchronized cells than for control cells (0.46 ± 0.15 × 10 5 vs. 225.11 ± 129.36 × 10 5 ; P < 0.05; Figure 5F ). These results confirm that G0/G1-phase arrest has different effects for the two enteroviruses.

G2/M synchronization with nocodazole has been shown to inhibit both the EV-D68 Fermon strain in this study (Figures 1I-L) and EV-A71 in our previous study (Yu et al., 2015) . To determine whether similar effects of G2/M-phase synchronization are observed for the currently circulating strains of EV-D68, cells were treated with 25 ng/ml nocodazole or medium for 24 h, and were then infected at 0.8 MOI for 2 h and treated with 25 ng/ml nocodazole or fresh medium for another 24 h. Our results demonstrate that nocodazole treatment decreased the genomic RNA levels ( Figure 6A ) and the TCID50/ml value ( Figure 6B) of Fermon, US/KY/14-18953 and US/MO/14-18947, which suggests that the virus inhibition upon G2/M synchronization may be similar for all enteroviruses.

To confirm that G2/M synchronization inhibits EV-D68 and EV-A71, we assessed the effects of an alternate agent that can exert G2/M arrest in vitro, pseudolaric acid B (PAB), which The progeny viruses of EV-D68 or EV-A71 in the supernatant were titrated using RD cells, and the TCID50/mL was shown. The results indicate the mean ± S.D of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001.

is a diterpene acid isolated from the root and trunk bark of Pseudolarix kaempferi Grord (Pinaceae) (Yu et al., 2007 (Yu et al., , 2013 . PAB was confirmed to promote G2/M arrest after 24 h ( Figure 6C) . To assess the effects of PAB on viral RNA and virulence, RD cells were infected with EV-D68 US/KY/14-18953 strain or EV-A71 at an MOI of 0.8 for 2 h and then treated with 2 µM PAB for 24 h. PAB decreased the genomic RNA levels of both EV-D68 (28.32% of control; P < 0.001; Figure 6D ) and EV-A71 (59.87% of control; P < 0.001; Figure 6E ). Furthermore, PAB decreased the TCID50/ml value of both EV-D68 (80.31% decrease; P < 0.01; Figure 6F ) and EV-A71 (91.27% decrease; P < 0.01; Figure 6G ). These results confirm that G2/M arrest inhibits both the EV-D68 and EV-A71 strains, which suggest a common approach for therapeutic intervention that might potentially target a broader range of enteroviruses.

Enterovirus 68 (EV-D68) usually causes mild to severe respiratory illness, including runny nose, sneezing, cough, body and muscle ache, wheezing, difficulty breathing, and in the cases of some infants, children and teens, death. Although EV-D68 was first identified in California in 1962, the number of people in one breakout in 2014 with confirmed EV-D68 infection was much greater than the number reported in previous years (http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/ev-d68.html). It is hard to predict whether EV-D68 will emerge again in future outbreaks, but the value of resolving the pathogenic mechanism of EV-D68 is obvious. In this study, we investigated the pathogenic mechanism of EV-D68 to reveal the relationship between virus infection and the host cell cycle.

To assess the possibility that the cell cycle status affects EV-D68 viral replication, we first synchronized cells in G0/G1. Our results demonstrate that G0/G1 arrest promotes EV-D68 replication and increases viral virulence without affecting virus entry. We also assessed the effects of S phase and G2/M phase synchronization on viral production. Our results suggest that S phase synchronization does not affect viral entry, replication or production compared to the control treatment, while G2/M synchronization inhibits viral replication and decreases viral virulence, but does not affect virus entry. These results indicate that G0/G1 phase is most favorable for EV-D68 replication, that S phase can support some viral production, and that G2/M phase is inhibitory for host viral production.

Given that G0/G1 phase supports EV-D68 production, it would be advantageous for the virus to manipulate the host cell cycle to increase viral production. Indeed, the EV-D68 Fermon strain displayed significant ability to increase the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase. The EV-D68 Fermon strain was isolated in the United States in 1962 (Schieble et al., 1967) , but currently circulating strains, including EV-D68 US/MO/14-18947 and US/KY/14-18953, may be more relevant to current human health. Therefore, we examined whether these two currently circulating strains had similar ability to manipulate the cell cycle. Our results confirmed that the circulating EV-D68 strains manipulate the cell cycle in a similar manner as does the Fermon strain, though the current strains have higher virulence than Fermon. Therefore, after more than 50 years' evolution, EV-D68 still possesses the ability to arrest cells at G0/G1 phase but EV-D68 virulence has increased.

To pinpoint the cause for G0/G1 accumulation upon EV-D68 infection, we analyzed the transitions from G0/G1 into S and from G2/M into G0/G1. After cell cycle release from G0/G1, mock-infected cells entered S phase, while EV-D68-infected cells still accumulated at G0/G1 phase, thus demonstrating that EV-D68 infection prevents S phase entry from G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, after G2/M synchronization, EV-D68 infection promoted cell cycle transition from G2/M into G0/G1 phase. Therefore, EV-D68 infection regulates G0/G1 cell cycle arrest both by promoting G0/G1 phase entry and by inhibiting G0/G1 phase departure. To further analyze the mechanism of host cell cycle manipulation by EV-D68, we assessed the expression of cyclins and CDKs that are known to form complexes to regulate cell cycle progression (Oosthuysen et al., 2015) . For example: cyclinD/CDK4 and cyclinD/CDK6 regulate G0/G1 progression (Massagué, 2004) ; cyclinE/CDK2 regulates S-phase entry from G1 (Hinds et al., 1992) ; cyclinA/CDK2 regulates Sphase progression by replacing cyclinE (Coverley et al., 2002; Yam et al., 2002) ; and cyclinB1/CDK1 prevents cell cycle transition from G2/M into G0/G1 (Yu et al., 2013; Adeyemi and Pintel, 2014) . We demonstrated that cyclinD, CDK4, CDK6, cyclinE1 and CDK2 are down-regulated after EV-D68 infection, which could explain the ability of EV-D68 to inhibit the transition from G0/G1 to S phase. Furthermore, the expression of cyclinB1 and CDK1 was down-regulated after EV-D68 infection, which is consistent with the ability of EV-D68 to promoting the transition from G2/M to G0/G1. Therefore, expression of cell cycle-related proteins further supports our results suggesting that EV-D68 induces G0/G1 arrest by regulating G0/G1 phase entry and exit. We also analyzed whether the regulation of protein expression occurred at the mRNA level and found that CDK2 and CDK1 were down-regulated by EV-D68, but that the other cell cycle proteins were not. This indicates that the regulation of cellular factors related to the cell cycle by EV-D68 occurs partly at the transcriptional level, but mostly occurs at the post-translational level.

Viral non-structural proteins are often essential for viral replication, so we also evaluated whether EV-D68 might exert its host cell cycle regulatory function via its viral non-structural proteins. Our results confirmed that the non-structural protein 3D increases the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase by decreasing the expression of the G0/G1 and S phase related-cell cycle proteins cyclinD, CDK4 and cyclinE1, while 3C decreases the percentage of cells in G2/M phase by decreasing the expression of G2/M-related proteins CDK1 and cyclinB1. These findings raise the possibility that the non-structural proteins 3D and 3C may function coordinately in the context of an EV-D68 infection to enhance the percentage of cells in G0/G1 and increase the G0/G1 to G2/M ratio. It is noted that non-structural 3D protein of EV-A71 mediates cell cycle arrest at S phase, while 3D of EV-D68 mediated cell cycle at G0/G1, although until now the detailed reason of the difference is not clear, it is speculated that 290 of same amino acid sequence might bind with a same target which is responsible for the function of cell cycle arrest, while 172 of different amino acid sequence might bind other different factors which is responsible for different ability of cell cycle regulation, and this part will be investigated in the future.

In the current study, we demonstrated that G0/G1 phase arrest was required by EV-D68 production; however, in a previous study, EV-A71 was shown to have the opposite effect (Yu et al., 2015) . This difference is surprising given that both EV-A71 and EV-D68 belong to the Picornaviridae family. To further confirm the different activities between the two viruses, we analyzed them side by side, and our results confirm that G0/G1 synchronization promotes EV-D68 viral production but inhibits EV-A71 viral production. Therefore, EV-D68 an EV-A71 can both manipulate the host cell cycle, but the process and outcomes of cell cycle manipulation are entirely different, which could explain why EV-D68 and EV-A71 have varying characteristics, such as the epidemic region (Europe and Asia), the clinical symptoms, and the epidemic size. Meanwhile, these results serve as a reminder that different enteroviruses may require different therapeutic treatments targeting a different set of host factors. Unfortunately, the reason of the difference between them is not clear, but it is speculated that some a host factor(s) generated or kept high level in G0/G1 phase was required by EV-D68 production, while EV-A71 required some a host factor(s) generated or kept high level in S phase so that their non-structural 3D were obligated by two viruses to regulate host cell cycle for their own replication.

The main goal of analyzing the mechanism of EV-D68 pathogenesis was to identify new strategies for preventing and treating the disease, so we did additional experiments to further explore G2/M synchronization as an approach to inhibit the replication of different EV-D68 strains. Our results demonstrate that in addition to its effects on the EV-D68 Fermon strain, G2/M synchronization by nocodazole inhibited the replication and virulence of US/KY/14-18953 and US/MO/14-18947. Additionally, PAB, which is another agent that can induce G2/M arrest, also significantly inhibited the production of EV-D68 and EV-A71. Because nocodazole also has been shown to be effective in inhibiting the production of EV-A71 (Yu et al., 2015) , medicines that induce G2/M arrest might be considered as a common approach for inhibiting different types of antienterovirus infection, which provides a new direction for antienterovirus drug development.

Risk Factors of Streptococcus suis Infection in Vietnam. A Case-Control Study

Background: Streptococcus suis infection, an emerging zoonosis, is an increasing public health problem across South East Asia and the most common cause of acute bacterial meningitis in adults in Vietnam. Little is known of the risk factors underlying the disease.

A case-control study with appropriate hospital and matched community controls for each patient was conducted between May 2006 and June 2009. Potential risk factors were assessed using a standardized questionnaire and investigation of throat and rectal S. suis carriage in cases, controls and their pigs, using real-time PCR and culture of swab samples. We recruited 101 cases of S. suis meningitis, 303 hospital controls and 300 community controls. By multivariate analysis, risk factors identified for S. suis infection as compared to either control group included eating ''high risk'' dishes, including such dishes as undercooked pig blood and pig intestine (OR 1 = 2.22; 95%CI = [1.15-4.28] and OR 2 = 4.44; 95%CI = [2.15-9.15]), occupations related to pigs (OR 1 = 3.84; 95%CI = [1.32-11.11] and OR 2 = 5.52; 95%CI = [1.49-20.39]), and exposures to pigs or pork in the presence of skin injuries (OR 1 = 7.48; 95%CI = [1.97-28.44] and OR 2 = 15.96; 95%CI = [2.97-85.72]). S. suis specific DNA was detected in rectal and throat swabs of 6 patients and was cultured from 2 rectal samples, but was not detected in such samples of 1522 healthy individuals or patients without S. suis infection.

Conclusions: This case control study, the largest prospective epidemiological assessment of this disease, has identified the most important risk factors associated with S. suis bacterial meningitis to be eating 'high risk' dishes popular in parts of Asia, occupational exposure to pigs and pig products, and preparation of pork in the presence of skin lesions. These risk factors can be addressed in public health campaigns aimed at preventing S. suis infection. Citation: Ho DTN, Le TPT, Wolbers M, Cao QT, Nguyen VMH, et al.

The importance of zoonotic emerging infections is increasingly recognized, as illustrated by outbreaks of SARS coronavirus and the ongoing threat of human infections with avian influenza H5N1 virus. It is essential to understand transmission dynamics and risk factors for infection, in order to design effective strategies to contain and prevent the spread of zoonotic diseases [1] . Streptococcus suis infection is an emerging zoonotic infectious disease, which is increasingly reported in Asia. It has become an important threat for human health, illustrated by the explosive outbreak in Sichuan Province China associated with at least 215 cases and 39 deaths in 2005 [2] . In Vietnam, S. suis infection was first reported in 1996 and the number of human cases has increased annually. In Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, it causes approximately 40% of all adult acute bacterial meningitis cases. This is more than Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis combined [3, 4, 5] .

S. suis is a Gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic coccus, which can be a commensal or pathogen for a wide range of mammalian species, particularly pigs. The natural habitat of S. suis in pigs is the upper respiratory-, the genital-and alimentary tracts. Based on differences in antigenic properties of the polysaccharide capsule, 33 serotypes have been distinguished to date, among which serotype 2 is most commonly associated with invasive disease in both pigs and humans. To date little is known of the risk factors underlying the disease or the portals of entry in humans. From small case series, the reported risk factor included occupational exposure, such as in slaughter house workers, butchers, and pig breeders, meat processing, and pig transport. It is hypothesized that patients may be infected through minor cuts or abrasions on their skin [2, 6] . However, whilst occupational exposure to pigs or pork was documented in 88% of the European patients described, it was reported in less than 50% of Asian cases [4, 7] , suggesting the contribution of other behavioural or exposure related risk factors in Asian populations, such as culinary habits or close proximity of pigs within households. In addition, whilst it is known that pigs can carry S. suis asymptomatically, it is not known if there is asymptomatic carriage of S. suis in humans, which could potentially contribute to an increased risk of infection, and to the possibilitiy of person-to-person transmission. We conducted a prospective case-control study to identify the risk factors of S. suis infection in Viet Nam.

The study was approved by the Scientific and Ethics Committee of the Hospital for Tropical diseases and the University of Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OXTREC 012-06).

This study was designed as a case-control study, including patients with invasive S. suis infection, an unmatched hospital control group and a community control group matched by residency and age, at a ratio of 1:3. The study was conducted at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases (HTD), a tertiary referral hospital of infectious diseases in the south of Viet Nam, between May 2006 and June 2009. The recruitment of cases and hospital control groups took place at the dedicated Central Nervous System (CNS) infectious disease ward at HTD. Community controls were recruited according to the residency of the cases in the south of Viet Nam, mainly in Ho Chi Minh City and the provinces of the Mekong River Delta.

Consecutive patients admitted with signs and symptoms consistent with central nervous system (CNS) infection were eligible for the study (Table 1) . When S. suis infection was confirmed, patients were included as cases. After inclusion of a patient as a case, the next three consecutive patients admitted to the ward who met the inclusion criteria were included as hospital controls. Three community controls, matched for age (within a 10 year age range), were randomly identified from a list of eligible households available at the health center in the community of residence of the case, by using random number tables ( Figure 1 ). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and controls or their care takers.

Risk factors were assessed using a standardized questionnaire. This questionnaire was developed in Vietnamese and validated at HTD and consisted of four parts; socio-demographic and cultural factors, medical history, potential exposure to pigs or pork and culinary habits and hygiene measures. We hypothesized that consumption of ''high risk'' food dishes (Table 2) , potentially contaminated with S. suis, could function as a source of infection. The majority of the questions were ''closed questions'' but ''open questions'' which allowed participants to explain in their own words were also included. Patients and hospital controls were interviewed when they were fully conscious. The questionnaire was filled in by structured interview, which was carried out by one of two research nurses on the ward for cases and hospital controls, or at the residency of community controls. The interviewers were blinded towards the diagnosis of the patient in the case and hospital control groups.

From all patients and controls, throat and rectal swab samples were taken on admission or at the community visit and a second set of swab samples was taken ten to fourteen days later. As detection of potential carriage in cases and hospital controls could be affected by their antimicrobial treatment, household members were also studied for carriage of S. suis serotype 2 since if carriage and associated transmission were to occur, household members of carriers are the most likely to become positive. Adult household members, defined as any adult (at least 15 years old) who resided for at least 50% of the week in the same house as the case or control, were identified either at the HTD, when taking care of a case or hospital control, or during the household visits. From each household, we choose a maximum of three adult household members from whom we took throat and rectal swabs in the same way as for the cases and controls, following written informed consent. For all cases and controls who reported exposure to pigs at home, sampling of the pigs was performed in collaboration with the Sub-department of Animal Health of Ho Chi Minh City. Swab samples were taken from all pigs present (except pregnant sows to avoid stress-induced miscarriage) within 4 weeks of admission of the patient, or at the second visit to the community controls.

Culture of blood and cerebrospinal fluid was performed in the microbiology laboratory of the HTD using standard culture methods. Blood samples were taken on admission for all patients and blood cultures were performed using the BD BACTECH 9050 blood culture system. S. suis was identified on the basis of colony morphology, negative catalase reaction, optochin resistance, and by APIStrep (Biomerieux, France) and subsequently serotyped (Statens Serum Institute, Denmark).

Swab samples were inoculated in transport medium (TRANS-WABSH, UK) at the site, and transferred to the laboratory at HTD or stored at 4uC until transfer within 48 hours. Samples were inoculated into selective Todd-Hewitt broth (OXOID, UK), containing Streptococcal Selective Reagent (Oxoid) and crystal violet [8] and incubated overnight at 37uC, followed by real-time PCR for detection of S. suis serotype 2. Positive samples were cultured to retrieve S. suis isolates.

We used an internally controlled real-time PCR for detection of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae type b, N. meningitidis and S. suis serotype 2 in CSF samples [4, 8, 9, 10] . The real-time PCR for detection of S. suis serotype 2 was also used on swab cultures. Previous validation of this PCR demonstrated a detection limit of 1-5 colony forming units per reaction [10] .

After bacterial lysis, DNA was extracted using the EasyMag extraction system (BioMerieux, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam), according to manufacturer's instructions and subjected to consecutive monoplex PCR reactions (CSF samples).

Demographic data obtained during a randomized study on the efficacy of adjunct dexamethasone for the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis showed that 59/226 (26%) of the non-S. suis patients had potential occupational exposure to pigs compared to 46/78 (59%) of S. suis meningitis patients [3] , corresponding to an odds ratio of 4. We decided on a target sample size of 100 cases (and 300 matched controls), corresponding to a recruitment period of approximately 4 years and a target odds ratio for 80% power of 2.1 assuming a probability of exposure in controls of 0.25 and a correlation coefficient for exposure between matched cases and controls of at most 0.2. With 100 cases, we also expected to fit reliable multivariate models with up to 10 covariates without over fitting the data [11] .

All variables of interest were summarized by group (case, hospital, or community control). Categorical variables were summarized as number and percent (%). Continuous variables were summarized as median and interquartile range (IQR). To assess univariate associations of S. suis with potential risk factors in hospital controls, we used both logistic regression without any adjustment for covariates and with adjustment for sex, age, and living in a rural or urban area. We used conditional logistic regression for the matched community controls and these analyses were performed with and without additional adjustment for sex (in addition to the matched variables age and place of living). In a multivariate analysis of potential risk factors of main interest, all potential risk factors plus the potential confounders (e.g. age, sex, place of living) were jointly included in a logistic (hospital controls) or conditional logistic (community controls) regression model. No model selection such as backwards elimination was performed. We included separate effects of exposure to pigs or pork depending on whether the individual had skin injuries or not. S. suis infection occurred predominantly in males but controls were not matched by gender. As a sensitivity analysis, we therefore repeated the multivariate analysis including only male cases and controls. All analyses were performed with Stata version 10.1 (StataCorp) software.

Between May 2006 and June 2009, 722 patients with suspected CNS infections or severe malaria were admitted to HTD. S. suis meningitis was diagnosed in 108 patients. Seven cases were excluded as they did not meet the inclusion criteria. We also excluded 311 other patients as they did not meet the inclusion criteria for hospital controls (Figure 2) . It was not possible to recruit community controls at the residency of one S. suis case because of the distance from the study site (Central Viet Nam, 800 kms from Ho Chi Minh City). During the period of recruitment we therefore included 101 cases of confirmed S. suis meningitis, 303 hospital controls and 300 community controls for analysis ( Figure 2 ). Patients were checked by nurses and doctors for skin injuries on forearms, hands and feet. Injuries were defined as lesions with signs of disruption of skin integrity.

Household exposure to pigs: breeding any number of pigs at home. Characteristics of the participants S. suis infection occurred sporadically throughout the year without any clear seasonality (Figure 3 ). Clustering of cases was not observed. Ninety-seven patients (96%) were infected with S. suis serotype 2 while only four patients (4%) were infected with other serotypes, including serotype 14 (3 cases) and untypeable serotype (1 case). S. suis cases were predominantly male (82%) and from a rural residence (81%) with a median (IQR) age of 50 (41-59) years. Twenty-one percent of cases had an occupation related to pigs, other exposure to pigs (46%), or reported eating ''high risk'' dishes in the two weeks prior to admission (48%). Hospital and community controls were more frequently female and (unmatched) hospital controls were significantly younger, with a higher proportion of urban residence (Table 3 ). We further analyzed the age distribution of cases, hospital controls and non-S. suis bacterial meningitis patients amongst the hospital controls. Nearly 70% of S. suis meningitis patients were older than 45 years, while only 25% of non-S. suis meningitis patients and 20% of all hospital controls belonged to this age group ( Table 4 ). The 49 hospital controls with bacterial meningitis (not S. suis) were significantly younger than S. suis cases with median (IQR) age of 27 (23-45) compared to 50 (41-59) years (p,0.001). 

Occupations related to pigs, breeding pigs at home, exposures to pigs or pork with skin injuries, eating ''high risk'' dishes in the last 2 weeks and having ill pigs at home in the last 4 weeks were associated with S. suis meningitis, after adjustment for residency, age and sex (Table 5 ). S. suis infection was independently associated with occupations related to pigs, exposures to pigs or pork in the presence of skin injuries in the 2 weeks prior to infection, and eating ''high risk'' dishes in the 2 weeks prior to infection after multivariate analysis. These associations were found in comparisons of cases with the hospital control group as well as with the community control group. Breeding pigs at home, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism or exposure to pigs or pork without skin injuries were not associated with S. suis infection in multivariate analysis (Table 6 ). In a sensitivity analysis, which included only male cases and controls, exactly the same risk factors were significant with similar odds ratios as in the main analysis. Risk factors identified by multivariate analysis of male cases and controls from either control group included eating ''high risk'' dishes (OR 1 ''High risk'' dishes predominantly consisted of undercooked food (Table 3 ). Exposure to pigs or pork in the presence of skin injuries, eating ''high risk'' dishes, or both, were reported in 72/ 101 S. suis cases (71.3%), 91/303 hospital controls (30%) and 84/ 300 community controls (28%). For 26 S. suis cases (25.7%), compared to 52 hospital controls (17.2%) and 29 community controls (9.7%), eating these ''high risk'' dishes was the only risk factor reported.

To investigate potential carriage of S. suis serotype 2, 197 throat swab samples and 197 rectal swab samples were taken from 101 S. suis patients (Table 7) . Six patients had PCR positive results, including one throat sample and six rectal samples. S. suis serotype 2 was cultured from this throat sample and from one of these rectal samples. Three of these six patients had pigs at home. No illness was reported in the last 4 weeks in these pigs, and the PCR results of pig tonsil swab samples were negative. None of these patients had skin injuries. Three patients had eaten pig intestines prior to admission. Of these, the throat swab sample was positive in one patient and rectal swab samples were positive in the two others. One patient, who had eaten pig intestines two days before admission, had two PCR positive rectal swab samples on separate occasions. S. suis serotype 2 was cultured from the first sample.

We collected 1162 throat and rectal swab samples from the 303 hospital controls and 4492 throat and rectal swab samples from healthy persons, including 300 community controls and 920 household members of cases, hospital controls and community controls. In none of these samples was S. suis serotype 2 detected. (Table 7) .

We collected 571 pig swab samples from pigs present around the house of 22 of 23 cases, 28 of 41 community controls and 13 of 33 hospital controls respectively, who kept pigs around the house ( Table 3 ). The median herd size was 7 pigs (range, 1 to 50). S. suis serotype 2 was detected in 9 (41%) case group herds, 3 (23%) hospital control group herds, and 5 (18%) matched community control group herds. Differences between case group and control groups were not statistically significant (Table 5) . 

We conducted the largest prospective epidemiological assessment of risk factors of S. suis infection globally. In addition to the previously suggested risk factors, occupational exposure and contact with pigs or pork without skin protection, we identified the ingestion of food with a high risk of contamination with S. suis serotype 2 to be an important risk factor for S. suis meningitis. To investigate eating habits as a risk factor of S. suis infection, we focused on potential ''high risk'' dishes common in Vietnam. These include fresh or under-cooked blood, tonsils, tongue, stomach, intestines and uterus. Such food items typically are undercooked when eaten as a main dish (as opposed to as components of well cooked main dishes such as rice or noodle soups), as was generally the case in our patients. By multivariate analysis, we demonstrated that eating these ''high risk'' dishes in the 2 weeks prior to admission was a significant risk factor for this infection. Eating habits were also confirmed as a risk factor during a relatively small S. suis outbreak in Thailand, associated with consumption of fresh pig blood. [12] . Eating pork was not associated with S. suis cases in a matched case-control study conducted during the outbreak in Sichuan province in 2005 [13] .

S. suis was isolated from raw pork samples obtained from markets in Hong Kong [14] . There may be a high bacterial load in food items that are kept at high ambient temperatures. Therefore, patients may be infected with S. suis through gastrointestinal tract if the ''high risk'' dishes are served as raw or under-cooked food.

We observed that the mean age of S. suis meningitis patients was significantly higher than the age of patients with bacterial meningitis caused by other bacteria, and that high age was associated with increased risk of infection with S. suis. In contrast, pediatric infections with S. suis are extremely rare, presumably related to a lack of exposure associated with increased risk of S. suis infection, in children.

The association between human S. suis infection and occupational exposures to pigs or pork has been reported in Europe and Asia since 1968 [6, 15, 16] . In Vietnam, the proportion of patients reported to have occupational exposures was lower than reported in European patients but it remained an important independent risk factor. Slaughtering and processing sick or dead pigs were also associated with S. suis infection in a case-control study conducted during the Sichuan outbreak [13] .

Significant skin injury was evident in 5/35 (14%) of people with S. suis in the UK, 4/15 cases (16%) in Hong Kong and 104/215 cases (48%) in Sichuan province's outbreak [2, 7, 15] . In our study, skin injuries were reported in 33/101 (33%) of S. suis patients compared to 18/303 (6%) of hospital controls and 11/300 (4%) of community controls (Table 3) . These minor skin injuries may allow direct entry of the bacteria in people with direct contact with infected pigs or pork. Contact with pigs within the last two weeks in the presence of skin lesions was associated with a significant high risk of infection (Table 6 ). Skin injuries were most often recorded in slaughter house workers, cooks and housewives involved in processing meat. Skin protection, including gloves, hand washing and exclusion of people with obvious skin lesions from direct contact with pigs and pork meat, may help to reduce the incidence of the disease.

We were unable to demonstrate S. suis serotype 2 carriage in 1522 healthy persons or patients without S. suis infection, including those with pig exposures. In contrast, 6/101 (6%) of patients had PCR positive swab samples, a rate similar to what was found in slaughterhouse workers in Germany [16] . Eating pig intestines in the few days prior to admission was reported in 3/6 of the patients with a PCR positive throat or rectal swab, two of which were also culture positive. Taken together, rather than indicating human carriage of S. suis serotype 2, our results strengthen the hypothesis that the gastrointestinal tract may be a route of entry for at least a proportion of patients.

In conclusion, S. suis is an important and emerging public health issue in Asia and one with the potential for both endemic transmission and for explosive epidemics. We identified risk factors for S. suis infection which can be addressed in health education programs targeted at individuals and communities at risk, focusing on skin protection for those in direct contact with pigs or pork and avoiding eating raw or under-cooked pig products.

Review Article Blow Flies Were One of the Possible Candidates for Transmission of Highly Pathogenic H5N1 Avian Influenza Virus during the 2004 Outbreaks in Japan

The 2003-2004 H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks in Japan were the first such outbreaks in 79 years in Japan. Epidemic outbreaks have been occurring in Southeast Asia, with the most recent in 2010. Knowledge of the transmission route responsible for the HPAI outbreaks in these countries remains elusive. Our studies strongly suggested that field and laboratory studies focusing on mechanical transmission by blow flies should be considered to control H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks, in particular in epidemic areas, where there are high densities of different fly species throughout the year. In this paper, we review these field and laboratory entomological studies and discuss the possibility of blow flies transmitting H5N1 viruses.

Miyazaki

The H5N1 subtype of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A virus has frequently infected wild and domestic ducks in Asia, causing huge economic damage to both poultry farms and governments in the affected countries. Most avian influenza viruses do not infect humans, but the 1997 outbreak of the H5N1 virus in Hong Kong [1, 2] alerted the medical community that some subtypes of avian influenza viruses include highly pathogenic strains that can affect humans. In this influenza virus outbreak, there were 6 deaths in the 18 human cases caused by the H5N1 subtype [3] . As of August 2, 2010, WHO has identified 502 human cases of H5N1 influenza around the world, and 298 of these were fatal [4] . In particular, H5N1 outbreaks have occurred recently in Egypt, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Therefore, H5N1 influenza virus can cause serious public health problems in birds and humans and is one of the most infectious avian diseases transmissible to humans.

From January 2004 to March 2004, there were outbreaks of acute, highly transmissible, lethal diseases in chickens at four poultry farms in Japan: one in Oita, one in Yamaguchi, and two in Kyoto Prefecture ( Figure 1 ). Virus isolates from infected chickens were all identified as influenza A virus of the H5N1 subtype [5] . Such highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) epidemics had not been reported in Japan for 79 years. Two avian influenza outbreaks at poultry farms in Tamba Town, Kyoto Prefecture, were the last two outbreaks of the 2004 avian epidemics in Japan. Since then, there were outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in Okayama and Miyazaki Prefectures in 2007. The H5N1 virus was also isolated from dead Whooper swans, Cygnus cygnus, in 2008 in Towada Lake, Akita Prefecture [6] . In addition, outbreaks of other subtypes of avian influenza virus have frequently occurred in Japan. The H5N2 avian influenza was reported in Ibaraki and Saitama Prefectures in 2005 and 2006, the H3 subtype was reported in Saitama Prefecture in 2009, and the H7 subtype was in Aichi Prefecture in 2009. We know of no report suggesting that H5N1 virus could be transmitted efficaciously from person to person, but the possibility remains that such transmission could evolve [7] .

Tamba Town (35 • 9 42 N and 135 • 26 31 E) is located in a hilly area 150-300 m above sea level, 50 km northwest of Kyoto City, Japan ( Figure 2 

Knowledge of the transmission route responsible for the HPAI outbreaks in Southeast and East Asian countries still remains elusive [5, 9] . Four hypotheses have been suggested for transmission of H5N1 in the HPAI outbreaks in Japan [6] : (1) H5N1-virus-infected chickens may have been imported from other countries, (2) materials (e.g., vehicles and egg containers) from infected area may have been used, (3) viruses may have been carried on clothes, boots, hands, and so forth, and (4) infected wild birds may have carried H5N1 virus into poultry farms to infect chickens. In particular, it has been suggested that migratory birds carried the viruses and subsequently infected domestic and/or wild ducks [9] . HPAI outbreaks in Japan. Therefore, it is very likely that the 2004 epidemics H5N1 virus was transmitted to Japan from East Asian countries. The important question is how could the H5N1 virus be transmitted from virus-positive migratory wild birds to domestic poultry in Japan? We have noted that it is unlikely that wild birds directly transmitted influenza viruses to poultry in Japan, because all of the Japanese poultry farms, where H5N1 virus outbreaks occurred, had fowling nets in place to prevent entry of wild birds. However, flying insects (e.g., flies) can easily get through the nets and invade a poultry farm. We have shown that a chicken can eat all 31 blow flies put inside its cage in just 7 min [10] . A chicken can catch and break down the body of a fly and even catch and swallow a fly in flight. Therefore, we have been interested in whether, if a chicken eats blow flies carrying H5N1 virus, the chickens might become infected and develop symptoms of H5N1 influenza.

Although the spring season in Japan is cold, some fly species are present. However, no studies have been reported on the possible role of flies in transmission of H5N1 influenza virus. Therefore, an entomological survey was conducted in March 2004 to investigate the possibility of blow flies transmitting H5N1 virus, using flies collected from around the infected poultry farm in Tamba Town for virus detection and isolation. Blow fly collection was carried out on 10-11 March 2004, just after the H5N1 outbreak at poultry farm B [11] . A sunny place protected from strong wind was selected, and rotten fish bait was placed on the ground. A total of 926 flies were collected within a 2.3 km radius of poultry farm A in Tamba Town ( Figure 2 ), representing eight fly species with >80% of the collected flies identified as either Calliphora nigribarbis Vollenhoven or Aldrichina grahami (Aldrich) (Figure 3 ). Influenza A virus matrix protein (M) and hemagglutinin (HA) genes were detected in the intestinal organs, crop, and gut of C. nigribarbis and A. grahami by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [11] . The prevalence of H5 subtype virus (20-30%) was higher in flies of both species collected 600-700 m from poultry farm A and lower (10%) in flies collected >2 km from poultry farm A. We found that nearly 5% of C. nigribarbis collected around the affected areas contained infectious H5N1 viruses. viral M, HA, and NA genes were amplified by PCR with universal primers, full-length sequences were analyzed, and sizes were found to be 991, 1,707, and 1,362 bp, respectively. These sequences showed high similarity to those of strains from chickens (A/chicken/Kyoto/3/2004) and crows (A/crows/Kyoto/53/2004) isolated during the 2004 outbreaks in Kyoto, with >99.9% identity for all three genes. The virus from C. nigribarbis (A/blow fly/Kyoto/93/2004) was characterized as an H5N1 subtype influenza A virus based on neuraminidase gene (NA) sequences. In addition, the HA1-HA2 connecting peptide sequence in the HA gene segment was RERRRKKR↓G. Finally, virus isolated from C. nigribarbis was characterized as a highly pathogenic H5N1 subtype influenza A virus.

To investigate whether H5N1 virus could survive in the blow fly C. nigribarbis, we monitored the titer of infectious virus in flies after they were exposed to the H5N1 avian influenza A virus (A/duck/Hyogo/35/2001) [10] . Fifty female blow flies (Kyoto strain C. nigribarbis), approximately 14 days old, were put into a 20 cm 3 fly cage for 3 h at 20 • C with a piece of cotton impregnated with 10 8 EID 50 /mL allantoic fluid from an H5N1 virus (A/duck/Hyogo/35/2001 [10] )-infected egg diluted with MEM diluents [11] . Following the 3 h virus exposure, the blow flies were individually reared at 20 • C or 10 • C until tested. Incubation at 10 • C was chosen because the average temperature around Tamba Town was 3.6 • C in February and 6.4 • C in March, with average daytime highs of 11.1 • C in February and 13.1 • C in March [12] .

Crops and intestines dissected from flies' bodies at various times after virus exposure were used for virus isolation and titration. Virus was isolated from fly crops and intestines up to 24 h after exposure and from feces and vomit matter of 1 of 3 blow flies at 48 h after exposure (Table 1) 

Two species of the blow fly, C. nigribarbis and A. graham, are categorized as larger-sized fly species in particular in comparison to the house fly Musca domestica (L.); its body size is 5-8 mm (Figure 2 ). The body length of female C. nigribarbis is 11-15 mm and approximately 1.5 times larger than that of female A. grahami (8-13 mm) . The capacity of the crop of female C. nigribarbis (average = 23 mL) is approximately five times greater than that of female A. grahami (average = 4.4 mL) [11] . The consumption rate of both C. nigribarbis and A. grahami might have been high because of their large body size. In fact, virus genes were found more often in C. nigribarbis than in A. grahami [11] . Stable flies, Muscina stabulans (Falle'n) and M. angustifrons (Loew), collected at the same collection sites and the same time as the fly surveillance in Kyoto, showed much smaller body size than C. nigribarbis and A. grahami, and no virus was detected in these smaller-sized flies [11] .

Blow flies prefer to lick animal carcasses and droppings. If food for blow flies is contaminated by pathogens, the flies might ingest significant numbers of pathogens. One possible mechanism for mechanical transmission of pathogens by blow flies is regurgitation and the feces on the food source [13, 14] . The effectiveness of mechanical transmission through regurgitation may depend on the viability and titer of pathogens in the fly's body. The accumulated droppings at a poultry farm should be a good breeding site for blow flies. If the flies reproduced at a poultry farm, they should have many opportunities for contact with viruses in the feces of infected chickens and/or their dead bodies.

Calliphora nigribarbis has a characteristic temperate-zone life cycle. For example, in Japan, they become more active between winter and spring for migration and reproduction [15, 16] . It is well known that C. nigribarbis has excellent flight capacity and high dispersal ability. They have been identified by weather ships at stations located on the Pacific Ocean and East China Sea, 300-450 km from Kyushu Island, Japan [17] . It was also suggested that the number of flies found in autumn in the Kyushu District appears to increase due to their transoceanic migration [18] . Female blow flies can survive for about one year in Japan [17] , in comparison to the house fly Musca domestica which has a mean longevity of 34.2 days [19] . The longevity and high dispersal ability of blow flies may also result in wide dispersion of viruses that they carry. Mark-release-recapture experiments conducted at Tamba Town in 2005 suggested that C. nigribarbis generally could migrate up to 2-3 km in 24 h [20] . The distance between the two poultry farms in Kyoto prefecture, where the two H5N1 virus outbreaks took place in 2004, was approximately 4 km. In fact, 10% of all C. nigribarbis flies collected at a site intermediate between the affected farms expressed H5N1 virus genes [11] . Viable titers of H5N1 influenza virus, but not virus replication, were detected for up to 24 h in the crop and intestine of virus-exposed C. nigribarbis [10] . The presence of infectious virus in blow flies for 24 h could have a strong implication for virus dispersion since blow flies, with their excellent flight capacity, could transport the H5N1 virus over significant distances. In addition, H5N1 virus has been isolated from feces and vomit matter of blow flies at the 48 h postexposure, but virus titers in flies at 48 h were lower than that of the virus-containing cotton used in these experiments. This suggested that the viability of influenza virus decreases steadily in the blow fly crop and intestine, although some infectious virus remains for longer than 24 h. Therefore, C. nigribarbis could transport H5N1 virus to poultry farms 2-3 km apart.

How often do H5 influenza viruses migrate to Japan? Which subtypes of H5 influenza virus migrate to Japan? To following previous studies [10, 11] . No H5 influenza virus gene was detected from a total number of 96 fly pools examined ( 

It is well known that the domestic house fly, Musca domestica spp., and some other fly species can transmit many kinds of pathogens mechanically [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . In particular, M. domestica spp. are the most important fly species at poultry farms [26] with regard to mechanical transmission of >30 different pathogens [13] , for example, bacteria, protozoa, viruses, and parasite oocysts and eggs. Some viruses can be transported to animals by contact with contaminated body surfaces of flies. In the case of the house fly, it has been shown that rotavirus can be mechanically transported by contaminated fly surfaces [21] . House flies frequently defecate while feeding and resting on food surfaces [27] . However, in studies of C. nigribarbis, neither defecation nor vomiting was observed within 24 h after feeding (data not shown). The body surface of the house fly could be contaminated by viruses easier than that of blow flies. This would suggest that the mechanisms of virus transmission by blow flies could be different from those of house flies. Therefore, to evaluate virus transmission mechanisms that are more complex than contact with a contaminated fly surface, blow fly intestinal organs, crop, and gut were analyzed for their possible role in transmission of avian influenza virus. A seasonal consideration is that M. domestica vicina populations are generally highest in the summer in Japan. In fact, no house fly was found around any poultry farm or pigpen in Tamba Town during our survey in March. Therefore, it seems reasonable that winter blow flies may be involved in transmission of winter pathogens, like influenza virus, by maintaining minimum infectious titers.

We have suggested here that blow flies are likely candidates for mechanical transmission of HPAI because of their ecological and physiological characteristics as reviewed here. In fact, blow flies have already been recognized as important vectors for mechanical transmission of several serious infectious diseases, that is, poxvirus [28] , rabbit hemorrhagic disease [29] , and paratuberculosis [30] . Recently, it has been reported that the H5N1 viral gene was detected in house flies [31] and engorged mosquitoes [32] . We suggest that mechanical transmission by flies may also be involved in the outbreak and pandemic of infectious diseases other than HPAI. However, although there are high densities of a variety of fly species during all seasons in Southeast Asia, their ability to transmit viruses has not been evaluated. The prevalence of H5N1 avian influenza is still a public health problem for birds and humans. Therefore, field and laboratory studies on mechanical transmission of pathogens by flies would be very important for controlling H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks, at least in epidemic Southeast Asian countries. Recently, the H5N1 virus surveillance conducted in Indonesia suggested that pigs are at risk of infection during outbreaks and pigs can serve as intermediate hosts in which this avian virus can adapt to mammals [33] . They also found the evidence of pig-to-pig transmission of this virus without any significant influenza-like signs. The transmission mechanism of this virus became more complicated and serious. As we introduced in the previous section, blow flies prefer to lick carcasses and droppings of not only chickens but also pigs. Furthermore, we can assume that the flies can access the pigpen easier than the poultry farm. This finding from Indonesia [33] strongly suggest that it is important to pay attention to pigpens as well as poultry farms within 2-3 km, where viable H5N1 viruses are transmitted by blow flies.

Usefulness of Cellular Analysis of Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid for Predicting the Etiology of Pneumonia in Critically Ill Patients

Background: The usefulness of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid cellular analysis in pneumonia has not been adequately evaluated. This study investigated the ability of cellular analysis of BAL fluid to differentially diagnose bacterial pneumonia from viral pneumonia in adult patients who are admitted to intensive care unit.

Methods: BAL fluid cellular analysis was evaluated in 47 adult patients who underwent bronchoscopic BAL following less than 24 hours of antimicrobial agent exposure. The abilities of BAL fluid total white blood cell (WBC) counts and differential cell counts to differentiate between bacterial and viral pneumonia were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.

Results: Bacterial pneumonia (n = 24) and viral pneumonia (n = 23) were frequently associated with neutrophilic pleocytosis in BAL fluid. BAL fluid median total WBC count (2,815/mL vs. 300/mL, P,0.001) and percentage of neutrophils (80.5% vs. 54.0%, P = 0.02) were significantly higher in the bacterial pneumonia group than in the viral pneumonia group. In ROC curve analysis, BAL fluid total WBC count showed the best discrimination, with an area under the curve of 0.855 (95% CI, 0.750-0.960). BAL fluid total WBC count $510/mL had a sensitivity of 83.3%, specificity of 78.3%, positive likelihood ratio (PLR) of 3.83, and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) of 0.21. When analyzed in combination with serum procalcitonin or C-reactive protein, sensitivity was 95.8%, specificity was 95.7%, PLR was 8.63, and NLR was 0.07. BAL fluid total WBC count $510/mL was an independent predictor of bacterial pneumonia with an adjusted odds ratio of 13.5 in multiple logistic regression analysis.

Conclusions: Cellular analysis of BAL fluid can aid early differential diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia from viral pneumonia in critically ill patients.

Severe pneumonia requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Delays in the provision of adequate antimicrobial therapy have been reported to be associated with excess mortality [1] [2] [3] ; therefore, rapid and accurate etiologic diagnosis of severe pneumonia is essential for successful treatment. In recent years, bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has been established as a useful technique for collecting lower respiratory tract specimens from the alveolar level, and can thus be used to accurately define the causative organisms of pneumonia [4] [5] [6] . However, a conventional culture usually takes at least a few days, and microbiological yield is often compromised by prior empirical usage of antimicrobial agents. In addition, identification of viruses and atypical organisms requires a separate etiologic work-up. Cellular analysis of BAL fluid, including total and differential cell counts and the CD4+:CD8+ T-lymphocyte ratio, is useful for the diagnosis of various interstitial lung diseases [7] [8] [9] . Under an appropriate clinical setting, BAL fluid analysis can provide highly suggestive or even diagnostic information for specific interstitial lung diseases in the absence of a lung biopsy [10] . However, only a few previous studies with limited patient populations [11] [12] [13] have evaluated the role of cellular analysis of BAL fluid in patients with suspected pneumonia. Most of these studies focused on the differential diagnosis of pneumonia from non-infectious pulmonary diseases, not on the prediction of pneumonia etiology. BAL fluid analysis can be performed within several hours. Therefore, such analysis would be useful for guiding early treatment if it could predict the etiology of pneumonia, similar to the role of cerebrospinal fluid cellular analysis, which can reliably differentiate among meningitis etiologies. Therefore, this study investigated whether analysis of the cellular profile of BAL fluid can predict the etiology of pneumonia in critically ill patients admitted to the medical ICU.

This study was based on data from a prospective observational cohort study conducted from March 2010 to May 2013. All patients admitted to the medical ICU of Asan Medical Center, a 2,700-bed tertiary care university-affiliated hospital in Seoul, Republic of Korea, with suspected severe pneumonia were prospectively identified and monitored until discharged [14] . The data collected included patient demographics, underlying diseases or conditions, illness severity scores including Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), type of pneumonia, laboratory data including microbiological tests, length of ICU stay, and outcome. The prospectively collected data were retrospectively analyzed. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Asan Medical Center and the requirement for informed consent was waived because of the observational nature of the study. All patients information was anonymized and deidentified prior to analysis.

Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients aged $18 years with a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia (see below for definition), and (2) patients who underwent bronchoscopic BAL for etiologic diagnosis of pneumonia. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients in whom the pathogen was not identified, (2) patients in whom BAL fluid analysis was impossible (due to severe neutropenia or clotting of specimen) or not performed, (3) patients with a mixed infection (identification of bacteria and virus), (4) patients who were treated with antimicrobial agents for more than 24 hours before bronchoscopic BAL, (5) patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, (6) patients with mycobacterial infection, and (7) patients with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.

Pneumonia was defined as the presence of an acute infiltrate on a chest radiograph and at least one of the following: fever (temperature $38.0uC) or hypothermia (temperature ,35.0uC), cough, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, and altered breath sounds on auscultation [15] . Pneumonia was categorized as communityacquired pneumonia (CAP), healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), as defined previously [16, 17] .

Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with BAL was performed following a standardized protocol as previously described [14] . Briefly, BAL was performed by instillation of three consecutive aliquots of sterile saline solution (20-30-30 ml) into the bronchial tree at the area that was most abnormal on the chest radiography. The right middle lobe or lingual segment was chosen in patients with bilateral diffuse infiltration. BAL fluid that was first retrieved was discarded, and BAL fluid that was subsequently retrieved was collected. The total cell count was determined using a hemocytometer. The corresponding amount of BAL fluid for 10 3 cells was centrifuged onto a microscope slide using a Thermo Shandon Cytospin (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), at 500 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature. The slide was airdried and stained with Wright-Giemsa stain. Differential cell counts that included percentages of neutrophils, lymphocytes, alveolar macrophages, and eosinophils were determined.

Bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures of endotracheal aspirates and BAL fluid were performed. Respiratory viruses were tested by a multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay using a Seeplex RV15 ACE Detection kit (Seegene Inc., Seoul, Korea) and/or shell vial culture. PCR to detect Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila, and a urinary antigen test to detect Streptococcus pneumoniae and L. pneumophilia serogroup 1 species were also performed.

Data were expressed as mean 6 standard deviation or median and 25-75% interquartile range according to data distribution. Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to determine the performances of BAL fluid cellular components, serum procalcitonin concentration, and C-reactive protein concentration for predicting bacterial pneumonia. Youden's Index (sensitivity + specificity-1) [18] was used to select the optimal cutoff points of the ROC curve. Area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were calculated. For positiveand negative predictive values, the prevalence of bacterial pneumonia in severe pneumonia patients admitted to the medical ICU was assumed to be 35.9%, based on our previous study [14] . Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of bacterial pneumonia. Variables with P values less than 0.2 in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis. The correlation between BAL fluid white blood cell (WBC) count and APACHE II score was determined by calculating Pearson's correlation coefficient. Significance was accepted at P # 0.05. All tests were performed using SPSS (version 18.0; SPSS, Inc.) and GraphPad Prism (version 5; GraphPad, Inc.) software. pneumonia underwent bronchoscopic BAL (67 with CAP, 159 with HCAP, and 133 with HAP). Of these patients, 100 were excluded because the pathogen was not identified, 42 were excluded because BAL fluid analysis was not possible (due to severe neutropenia or specimen clotting) or not performed, 52 were excluded because two or more types of pathogens were identified, and 100 were excluded because they received antimicrobial therapy for more than 24 hours before bronchoscopic BAL. Ten patients with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, 5 patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, and 3 patients with mycobacterial pneumonia were also excluded. Finally, 47 patients (24 with bacterial pneumonia and 23 with viral pneumonia) were included.

The characteristics of the 47 patients are shown in Table 1 . Thirty-two patients (68.1%) were men and the mean age was 62.1 years. Structural lung disease was the most common underlying disease (29.8%), followed by diabetes mellitus (19.0%), and hematologic malignancy/solid cancer (both 12.8%). Sixteen patients (34.0%) had CAP, 25 (53.2%) had HCAP, and 6 (12.8%) had HAP. Most baseline characteristics did not significantly differ between the bacterial pneumonia and viral pneumonia groups. By contrast, mean APACHE II (27.066.8 vs. 20.865.3, P = .002) and SOFA (11.363.7 vs. 7.663.2, P = .001) scores were significantly higher in the bacterial pneumonia group than in the viral pneumonia group. However, mortality rates, including 28-day mortality, did not significantly differ between the groups.

Pathogens that were identified in 47 patients are summarized in Table 2 . Twenty-eight bacterial pathogens were identified in 24 patients. In 4 patients, two different bacteria were identified. Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5) was the most common bacteria, followed by Legionella pneumophila (n = 4), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 3). Bacteria were identified from BAL fluid cultures or PCRs in 15 patients, from endotracheal aspirates or sputum cultures in 15 patients, from blood cultures in 4 patients, and from urinary antigen tests in 4 patients (two patients with pneumococcal antigens and two patients with legionella antigens). Eleven patients had two or more positive tests. Twenty-six viruses were identified in 23 patients. In three patients, two different viruses were identified. Rhinovirus was the most common virus (n = 11), followed by influenza virus (n = 6), and respiratory syncytial virus (n = 3). Viruses were identified from BAL fluid specimens in 18 patients and from nasopharyngeal specimens in 13 patients. Viruses were detected in both in BAL fluid and nasopharyngeal samples in 8 patients.

Cellular BAL fluid profiles and distributions of BAL fluid cell counts in the two groups are shown in Table 3 and Figure 2 . Detailed data of each patient are summarized in Table S1 . The median total WBC count (2,815/mL vs. 300/mL, P,0.001), percentage of neutrophils (80.5% vs. 54.0%, P = 0.02), and absolute neutrophil count (2,661/mL vs. 204/mL, P,0.001) of BAL fluid were significantly higher in the bacterial pneumonia group than in the viral pneumonia group. The median serum procalcitonin concentration was also higher in the bacterial pneumonia group than in the viral pneumonia group (1.9 ng/ml vs. 0.3 ng/ml, P = 0.02), and the C-reactive protein concentration tended to be higher in the bacterial pneumonia group than in the viral pneumonia group (20.3 mg/dL vs. 14.9 mg/dL, P = 0.09).

Of the 100 pathogen-identified patients who had received antimicrobial agent for more than 24 hours prior to bronchoscopic BAL (Figure 1) , 44 had bacterial pneumonia, 54 had viral pneumonia, and 2 had invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Of the 98 patients with bacterial pneumonia or viral pneumonia, the median duration of antimicrobial therapy before bronchoscopic BAL was 5 days (interquartile range, 3-9 days). The median total WBC count (395/mL vs. 200/mL, P = 0.52) and percentage of neutrophils (69.0% vs. 67.0%, P = 0.26) were not significantly different between these two groups. Figure S1 shows the changes recorded in the BAL fluid total WBC count and percentage of neutrophils according to the duration of exposure to antimicrobial agents.

Diagnostic performances of BAL fluid cellular components, serum procalcitonin concentration, and serum C-reactive protein concentration for the prediction of bacterial pneumonia

The ability of BAL fluid cellular analysis to distinguish between bacterial pneumonia and viral pneumonia was assessed using ROC analysis (Table 3 last The sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values, negative predictive values, positive likelihood ratios, and negative likelihood ratios are summarized in Table 4 . When the cutoff value of BAL fluid total WBC count was $510/mL, which was selected using Youden's Index, sensitivity was 83.3% (95% CI; 67.9-93.2), specificity was 78.3% (95% CI; 62.2-88.6), positive predictive value was 68.2% (95% CI; 49.2-82.6), negative predictive value was 89.3% (95% CI; 77.0-95.5), positive likelihood ratio was 3.83 (95% CI; 1.80-8.17), and negative likelihood ratio was 0.21 (95% CI; 0.08-0.52). A combination of BAL fluid total WBC count $ 510/mL or serum procalcitonin concentration $0.71 ng/mL had a sensitivity of 95.8% (95% CI; 81.6-99.8) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.07 (95% CI; 0.003-0.40), whereas BAL fluid total WBC count $510/mL and serum C-reactive protein concentration $26.1 mg/dl had specificity of 95.7% (95% CI, 81.6-99.8) and a positive likelihood ratio of 8.63 (95% CI, 1.31-180.96).

When a cutoff value of BAL fluid total WBC count $510/mL was applied to 100 pathogen-identified patients who had received antimicrobial agent for more than 24 hours, sensitivity was 36.8% (95% CI; 21.8-54.0), specificity was 71.4% (95% CI; 56.7-83.4), positive predictive value was 41.9% (95% CI; 28.2-57.0), negative predictive value was 66.9% (95% CI; 59.9-73.2), positive likelihood ratio was 1.29 (95% CI; 0.70-2.37), and negative likelihood ratio was 0.89 (95% CI; 0.66-1.19).

Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that BAL fluid total WBC count $510/mL was an independent predictor of bacterial pneumonia with an adjusted odds ratio of 13.5 (95% CI; 2.3-80.4) ( Table 5 ). There was a modest but significant positive correlation between the degree of BAL leukocytosis and the APACHE II score (r = 0.419, P = 0.05) (Figure 4) . Table 3 . Bronchoalveolar lavage total and differential cell counts (%) in patients with pneumonia. 

This study analyzed the usefulness of cellular analysis of BAL fluid for predicting the etiology of pneumonia in critically ill adult patients. Neutrophilic pleocytosis in BAL fluid was frequently found in patients with bacterial-and viral pneumonia. The degree of pleocytosis, which was higher in the bacterial pneumonia, was useful for differential diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia. Total WBC count had the best diagnostic accuracy for predicting bacterial pneumonia, and its diagnostic performances was better than those of serum procalcitonin and C-reactive protein concentrations. Combinations of BAL fluid total WBC count, serum procalcitonin concentration, and serum C-reactive protein concentration provided the best diagnostic yields. The data suggest that cellular analysis of BAL fluid is a rapid and useful technique for differentiating bacterial pneumonia from viral pneumonia, and can be used to direct early appropriate treatment.

Information about the role of cellular profiles of BAL fluid for differential diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia in adult patients is limited. Stolz et al [11] . evaluated potential markers of bacterial infection in a cohort of immunocompromised patients with pulmonary complications. They reported that the percentage of neutrophils in BAL fluid and the serum procalcitonin concentration are independent predictors of bacterial infection. They suggested that the optimal cutoff value of the percentage of neutrophils in BAL fluid is 15% (sensitivity 84%; specificity 77%), which is much lower than the cutoff value in the current study. Sternberg et al. [13] investigated the usefulness of BAL in assessing pneumonia in renal transplant patients, and suggested that the optimal cutoff value of the percentage of neutrophils in BAL fluid is .20% for predicting bacterial pneumonia. However, neither of these previous studies included patients with severe pneumonia caused by respiratory viruses alone, and both compared BAL findings between patients with bacterial pneumonia and those with non-infectious diseases. In the current study, patients with viral pneumonia were included by using the newly developed multiplex respiratory virus RT-PCR. This showed that cases of viral pneumonia were frequently associated with neutrophilia in BAL fluid (median 54.0%). We speculate that this underlies why the optimal cutoff value of percentage of neutrophils in BAL fluid for predicting bacterial pneumonia is much higher in the current study (64%, Table 4 ) than in previous studies. Several authors of the current study previously investigated the diagnostic utility of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1) in BAL fluid of various patient populations with bilateral lung infiltrates. A cutoff value of $60% neutrophils in BAL fluid is useful for differential diagnosis of bacterial or fungal pneumonia from other causes of pneumonia or non-infectious diseases (AUC = 0.77, 95% CI; 0.54-0.84, P = 0.001) [12] . In comparison to this previous study, the current study did not include patients with non-infectious diseases or fungal pneumonia, included much more cases of severe viral pneumonia, and analyzed the counts of various cell types.

Among the currently available inflammatory markers, serum procalcitonin is one of the best indicators of bacterial infections, including lower respiratory tract infections [19] . The usefulness of serum procalcitonin measurements has been validated in the diagnosis, severity assessment, and follow-up of patients with lower respiratory tract infections [20] [21] [22] . In the current study, the AUC of serum procalcitonin concentration for predicting bacterial pneumonia (AUC = 0.705) was smaller than those of total WBC (AUC = 0.855) and neutrophil (AUC = 0.837) counts. The combination of BAL fluid WBC counts and serum procalcitonin concentration tended to improve the diagnostic accuracy of the ROC model. This indicates that combinations of these markers can be useful to rule-out (BAL fluid total WBC count $510/mL or serum procalcitonin concentration $0.71 ng/mL with a sensitivity of 95.8% and negative likelihood ratio of 0.068) or rule-in (BAL fluid total WBC count $510/mL and serum C-reactive protein concentration $26.1 mg/dl with a specificity of 95.7% and positive likelihood ratio of 8.63) bacterial pneumonia. Diagnostic accuracy could be further improved if BAL fluid cellular profiles are interpreted alongside clinical presentations, radiographic studies, and other relevant test results. Using this approach, it might be possible to identify patients who can be managed without antibacterial agents or those who require antiviral agents.

Although not included in the current study, sTREM-1 in BAL fluid is another notable biomarker for the diagnosis of pneumonia. sTREM-1 is reportedly a potent discriminator of bacterial pneumonia from non-infectious lung infiltrations [12, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . However, the proposed cutoff values of sTREM-1 concentration vary widely (5-900 pg/ml) and some studies have questioned the reliability of BAL fluid sTREM-1 [28] [29] [30] . Studies on BAL fluid sTREM-1 have mainly been confined to patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia. Therefore, the usefulness of sTREM-1 for etiologic diagnosis of pneumonia, especially differential diagnosis of viral pneumonia, has not been elucidated yet. The current study directly compared patients with bacterial and viral pneumonia, and therefore differs from previous studies of sTREM-1. BAL fluid sTREM-1 concentration in combination with the BAL fluid cellular profile might exhibit better diagnostic performance, although this warrants further studies.

A strength of the current study is the relatively strict enrollment criteria used. To minimize bias associated with antimicrobial therapy, all patients who received antimicrobial therapy for more than 24 hours were excluded, regardless of the adequacy of prior antimicrobial therapy. By using strict enrollment criteria, however, only a small proportion of pneumonia patients who underwent bronchoscopic BAL was finally included (Figure 1 ), which might have influenced on the results. However, positive likelihood and negative likelihood ratio, which are not influenced by disease prevalence, were good, which supports the validity of the data. In clinical practice, the results might be applied to patients who have received antimicrobial therapy more than 24 hours. That is, if BAL fluid cellular analysis shows evident pleocytosis even after antimicrobial therapy for more than 24 hours, it would be a strong suggestion for bacterial etiology.

The study has several limitations. First, the small sample size of the select critically ill patient population analyzed limits the general applicability of our findings. Moreover, since our study included critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia who were not receiving antimicrobial therapy, our results may not be applicable to the majority of severe pneumonia patients in clinical practice. Second, the impact of antimicrobial therapy on the both BAL fluid cellular profiles and other inflammation markers such as procalcitonin, remains to be further elucidated. Third, cases of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and mycobacterial pneumonia, were not included, mainly because few patients had these types of pneumonia. Fourth, patients with non-infectious causes of pulmonary infiltrates that can often mimic infectious causes, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, and drug-induced pneumonitis, were also excluded from our analyses. The inclusion of those cases may have caused a marked decrease in the specificity of our BAL fluid criteria. Finally, all the pathogens were not directly identified from BAL fluid. Some patients were included in whom pathogens were identified by other means, such as blood culture, endotracheal aspirates culture, urinary pneumococcal antigen test, and PCR from nasopharyngeal samples, as long as clinically and radiographically compatible and no other etiology was demonstrated. Therefore, patients with coincidental upper respiratory infections or colonization may have been included.

In conclusion, the data indicate that cellular analysis of BAL fluid, alone or in combination with serum procalcitonin and Creactive protein concentrations, may rapidly provide valuable diagnostic information for the early differential diagnosis of pneumonia in critically ill adult patients. 

CSF1R antagonism limits local restimulation of antiviral CD8 + T cells during viral encephalitis

Background: Microglia are resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS) locally maintained through colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling. Microglial depletion via CSF1R inactivation improves cognition in mouse models of neuroinflammation, but limits virologic control in the CNS of mouse models of neurotropic infections by unknown mechanisms. We hypothesize that CSF1R plays a critical role in myeloid cell responses that restrict viral replication and locally restimulate recruited antiviral T cells within the CNS. Methods: The impact of CSF1R signaling during West Nile virus infection was assessed in vivo using a mouse model of neurotropic infection. Pharmacological inactivation of CSF1R was achieved using PLX5622 prior to infection with virulent or attenuated strains of West Nile virus (WNV), an emerging neuropathogen. The subsequent effect of CSF1R antagonism on virologic control was assessed by measuring mortality and viral titers in the CNS and peripheral organs. Immune responses were assessed by flow cytometric-based phenotypic analyses of both peripheral and CNS immune cells. Results: Mice treated with CSF1R antagonist prior to infection exhibited higher susceptibility to lethal WNV infection and lack of virologic control in both the CNS and periphery. CSFR1 antagonism reduced B7 co-stimulatory signals on peripheral and CNS antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by depleting CNS cellular sources, which limited local reactivation of CNS-infiltrating virus-specific T cells and reduced viral clearance.

Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the impact of CSF1R antagonism on APC activation in the CNS and periphery and the importance of microglia in orchestrating the CNS immune response following neurotropic viral infection. These data will be an important consideration when assessing the benefit of CSF1R antagonism, which has been investigated as a therapeutic for neurodegenerative conditions, in which neuroinflammation is a contributing factor.

West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging human pathogen that causes seasonal outbreaks through the Western hemisphere since its introduction in 1999 [1] . A member of the Flavivirus genus, WNV is an enveloped, single-stranded positive sense RNA virus that cycles between birds and mosquitos. Symptoms of WNV infection can range from a relatively mild flu-like illness, West Nile fever, to severe neuroinvasive disease. After peripheral infection, WNV replicates within lymphoid tissues before entering the CNS, where it targets neurons in the cerebellum, brainstem, and cerebral cortex [2, 3] . In 2017, 2002 symptomatic WNV cases were reported to the CDC, and of those, 1339 (67%) were classified as neuroinvasive [4] . Prolonged neurological deficits, which include motor functions, verbal learning and memory, and executive functions, are a significant problem for survivors of WNV infection and appear to manifest even in cases where neuroinvasion is absent [5] [6] [7] .

Recent work indicates that persistent phagocytic microglia contribute to prolonged cognitive dysfunction following WNV encephalitis [8] , and thus, limiting microglial activation may alleviate the associated neurological sequelae.

Microglia are the resident immune cells in the CNS, originating from yolk sac progenitor cells that seed the brain early in development [9] . In addition to a multitude of homeostatic functions throughout development and healthy aging [10, 11] , microglia participate in both innate and adaptive immune responses through recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns [12] , which stimulate morphological changes [13, 14] and increase production of reactive oxidative species [15, 16] and cytokines/chemokines [17, 18] . During neurotropic virus infection, virally infected cells secrete chemokines including CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL10, which facilitate immune cells crossing the blood brain barrier (BBB) [19] [20] [21] . Mononuclear cell infiltration into the CNS is a hallmark of WNV encephalitis, and monocytes and T cells are critical for CNS virologic control. Elimination of monocytes using a liposome-encapsulated drug dichloromethylene diphosphonate or by genetic deletion of CCR2 increases mortality in mice infected with a neurotropic strain of WNV [22, 23] . However, monocytes may also contribute to dissemination of virus to the CNS [24, 25] , and inhibition of monocyte infiltration may also protect against nitric oxide-mediated immunopathology [26] . CD4 + T cells produce antiviral molecules, such as interferon γ (IFNγ) and IL-2, which promotes antiviral humoral immunity and sustains WNV-specific CD8 + T cell responses, enabling viral clearance in all organs [27, 28] . CD8 + T cells contribute to viral clearance and recovery from WNV infection via both cytopathic and noncytopathic mechanisms [29] [30] [31] [32] . Mice lacking either CD8 + T cells or MHC-I molecules have higher CNS viral burdens, increased mortality after infection, and prolonged viral persistence, suggesting that cell-mediated immunity controls virus within the CNS [32] .

CSF1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling is essential for the development of many mononuclear phagocytes including microglia. Tissue-resident macrophages, such as microglia, fail to develop in Csf1r −/− mice [9] , but in contrast to many tissue macrophages, adult microglia can still form in Csf1 op/op mice, which carry a natural null mutation in the Csf1 gene [33] . This is due to an alternative CSF1R ligand, IL-34, which is highly expressed by neurons [34, 35] . Similar to Csf1 op/op mice, IL-34 −/− mice develop fewer microglia but do not lack peripheral macrophages [36] . These mice are more susceptible to lethal neurotropic WNV infection, which is associated with increased neuronal apoptosis without increased viral replication [36] . In order to temporally control microglial depletion, pharmacologic agents that antagonize CSF1R have been developed, including antagonist PLX5622, which depletes microglia in as little as 3 days and may be sustained for at least 6 weeks [37] . These agents are being investigated as therapeutics in models of neurodegenerative diseases in which microglial activation is considered a contributing factor, such as traumatic brain injury [38, 39] , experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [40] , and Alzheimer's disease [41] . Here, we used PLX5622 in a model of WNV encephalitis to examine the effect of CSF1R antagonism in the setting of neurotropic viral infection. Our results show that mice treated with PLX5622 are more susceptible to lethal WNV infection, which is associated with increased CNS viral burden and neuronal apoptosis. PLX5622 also reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines and B7 co-stimulatory molecules within the infected CNS by depleting cellular sources, including resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages, as well as decreasing expression on peripheral antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The loss of APCs in the CNS resulted in limited local reactivation of recruited antiviral CD8 + T cells, which are required for virologic control in the CNS. Together, these data demonstrate the impact of CSF1R antagonism on APC activation during viral infection in both the CNS and periphery and highlight the importance of microglia in orchestrating cell-mediated antiviral immunity during neurotropic infection.

All experiments were performed in strict compliance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and according to the international Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research Involving Animals. The protocol was approved by the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis Animal Safety Committee (#20170064).

WNV-NY is strain 3000.0259, isolated in New York in 2000 [42] and passaged twice in C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells to generate an insect cell-derived stock for f.p. inoculations. For i.c. inoculations of WNV-NY, virus strain 3000.0259 was passaged once in Vero cells to generate mammalian cell-derived stock. Attenuated WNV-NS5-E218A was constructed from WNV 3356 strain as described previously [43, 44] and was passaged once in Vero cells, as described previously [45] . Stock titers for all viruses were determined using BHK21 cells for viral plaque assay as previously described [46] .

All mice used in these experiments were male C57BL/6 inbred mice obtained commercially (The Jackson Laboratory). All mice were housed in pathogen-free facilities at the Washington University School of Medicine. PLX5622 was provided by Plexxikon Inc. and formulated in AIN-76A rodent diet at a dose of 1200 mg/kg by Research Diets. Mice were provided PLX5622 or control AIN-76A chow starting at 6 weeks of age for 2 weeks. For viral inoculations, mice were anesthesthetized with a cocktail of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine, then inoculated subcutaneously via footpad injection (f.p., 50 μl) or intracranially (i.c., 10 μl) with a guided 29G needle into the brain's third ventricle.

For in vivo virus replication experiments, mice were infected with WNV and euthanized at specific days post-infection, as indicated. For tissue collection, mice were deeply anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine, blood collected in serum separator tubes, then transcardially perfused with sterile Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (dPBS; Gibco). The spleen and kidneys were collected, then the brain and spinal cord removed and microdissected. All organs were snap frozen, weighed, and then homogenized in dPBS. Virus was titered by standard plaque assay with BHK21 cells, as described previously [46] . Serum viremia was measured using TaqMan quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) primers and probe listed in Table 1 , as described previously [47] .

For flow cytometry experiments, mice were deeply anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine, then blood was collected in 5 μM EDTA in dPBS (Gibco). Mice were transcardially perfused with dPBS, and then, the spleen, brain, popliteal LNs, and femur were removed. Bone marrow was collected from the femur by centrifuging the bone in a 0.65-ml microtube punctured with an 18G needle nested inside a 1.7-ml tube. Brain tissue was minced and digested in a HBSS (Gibco) containing 0.05% collagenase D (Sigma), 0.1 μg/ml TLCK trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), 10 μg/ml DNase I (Sigma), and 10 mM Hepes pH 7.4 (Gibco) for 1 h at 22°C with shaking. Brain, spleen, and LN tissues were pushed through a 70-μm strainer and centrifuged at 500g for 10 min. Brain cell pellets were resuspended in 37% isotonic Percoll (GE healthcare) and centrifuged at 1200g for 30 min to remove myelin debris, and pellet was resuspended in dPBS. Red blood cells were lysed in blood, spleen, and bone marrow samples with ACK lysing buffer (Gibco) for 5 min, then centrifuged at 500g for 10 min and resuspended in dPBS. Prior to immunostaining, all cells were blocked with 1:50

TruStain FcX anti-mouse CD16/32 (Clone 93, Biolegend, Cat 101320) for 5 min. Cells were stained with antibodies, as indicated for 15 min at 22°C, then washed thrice with dPBS, and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Data were collected with a BD LSR Fortessa X-20 flow cytometer and analyzed with FlowJo software. Flow cytometry antibodies with goat-anti-rabbit-AF488 (4 μg/ml, Invitrogen, Cat A11008), counterstained with 1 μg/ml DAPI, and coverslipped with Prolong Gold Antifade Mountant (Thermo-Fisher, Cat P36930). Z-stack images (seven images separated by 1 μm) were captured using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope at × 40 objective magnification then compressed into a maximum intensity projection with accompanying software. For each region of each mouse, three to six images were taken from two different sagittal sections spaced at least 50 μm apart. The number of DAPI-positive nuclei also positive for NeuN and Tunel were counted by an individual blinded to the conditions.

Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software). All data were analyzed using an unpaired t test or two-way ANOVA with Sidak's post-test to correct for multiple comparisons, as indicated in the corresponding figure legends. A P value < 0.05 was considered significant.

CSF1R signaling is essential for the development of mononuclear phagocytes including microglia, but pharmacological antagonism has been reported to selectively deplete microglia [48] . To examine the impact of CSF1R antagonism on both peripheral and CNS mononuclear cells, we used PLX5622, which reportedly depletes microglia in as little as 3 days and may be sustained for at least 6 weeks [37, 41] . Mice were provided either control chow or PLX5622-embedded chow for 2 weeks, after which microglia numbers were assessed by flow cytometry using the microglia-specific marker P2RY12 (Additional file 1) and by immunohistochemistry using Iba1 (Additional file 2). Quantification shows that 2 weeks of PLX5622 treatment reduced microglia in the CNS by 90-95% (Additional file 1 A-F, P, Q). Specificity of P2RY12 for CNS-resident microglia is demonstrated by lack of staining in leukocytes isolated from peripheral immune compartments (Additional file 1 G-O). Within the CNS, PLX5622 treatment significantly depleted microglia across hippocampal, cortical, and cerebellar brain regions (Additional file 2). To determine whether PLX5622 treatment depleted mononuclear cells in peripheral immune compartments, we assessed numbers of antigen-presenting cells (APCs, Fig. 1 ) and T cells (Additional file 3) in the spleen and blood of uninfected mice in control versus PLX5622-treated mice. PLX5622 treatment significantly reduced circulating CD11c + (Fig. 1a-c) , MHCII + CD11c + (Fig. 1d-f ), and CD11b neg CD11c + (Fig. 1g -i) cells in the blood. In the spleen, however, there was no significant difference in populations of APCs with PLX5622 treatment (Fig. 1j-r) .

In addition, no significant difference in populations of T cells was detected in uninfected mice in either compartment (Additional file 3). Because of the sensitivity of microglia and APCs to CSF1R antagonism, we assessed whether CSF1R antagonism depleted CD11b + , Ly6C + , and Ly6G + cells in the blood, spleen, and bone marrow of PLX5622-treated versus control-treated uninfected mice. Flow cytometry analysis revealed no significant differences in populations of these cells in uninfected mice (Additional file 4). Together, these data indicate that circulating APCs, but not bone marrow or splenic mononuclear cells, are decreased in the context of CSF1R antagonism.

To determine whether CSF1R antagonism impacts survival from WNV infection, mice were fed PLX5622-embedded chow for 2 weeks, then infected with WNV-NY [42] at either 10 2 or 10 4 PFU via footpad (f.p.) inoculation. Consistent with published data [8, 49] , 30% of control-treated mice survived infection with 10 4 PFU and 90% of control-treated mice survived infection with 10 2 PFU; however, mice treated with PLX5622 universally succumbed to infection with either inoculum titer (Fig. 2a) . This was associated with significantly increased weight loss (Fig. 2b ) and more severe clinical score (Fig. 2c, d) in PLX5622-treated compared with control-treated mice infected with 10 2 PFU WNV-NY.

To determine whether increased mortality caused by PLX5622 treatment is associated with increased viral replication in peripheral or CNS tissues, tissue viral loads were assessed by plaque assay, and serum viral loads were determined by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) at 2, 4, 6, and 8 days post-infection (dpi). In the CNS, virus was first detected in the olfactory bulb (Fig. 2e) , then sequentially in more caudal regions including the cortex (Fig. 2f ) , cerebellum (Fig. 2g ), brainstem (Fig. 2h) , and spinal cord (Fig. 2i) . Compared with control-treated animals, PLX5622-treated mice exhibited higher viral titers in the olfactory bulb and cortex at 6 and 8 dpi and in the cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord at 8 dpi; however, viral titers were also significantly higher in peripheral tissues of PLX5622-treated mice including the spleen at 4 dpi (Fig. 2j) , kidney at 4 and 6 dpi (Fig. 2k) , and serum at 2, 4, 6, and 8 dpi (Fig. 2l ). PLX5622 treatment did not cause increased BBB permeability in infected mice (Additional file 5). Once WNV-NY enters the CNS via intracranial (i.c.) inoculation, PLX5622 treatment did not affect neuronal permissivity to infection (Additional file 6). Together, these data indicate a loss of immune-mediated virologic control in both peripheral and CNS tissues in CSF1R antagonist-treated mice, consistent with prior data suggesting that CSF1R signaling plays important roles in the function of both peripheral and CNS myeloid cells [50] [51] [52] .

To determine whether microglia depletion impacts innate immune mechanisms of virologic control specifically within the CNS, mice were fed control or PLX5622-embedded chow for 2 weeks, then i.c. infected with an attenuated strain of WNV (WNV-NS5-E218A) at 10 4 PFU. The NS5-E218A point mutation abolishes 2′-O-methyltransferase activity, which functions to methylate the 5′ cap of viral RNA and facilitate escape of IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT)-mediated suppression; thus, this attenuation limits viral replication by increasing sensitivity of the virus to type I IFN-mediated innate immune mechanisms [45, 49] . Despite this attenuation, mice treated with PLX5622 were significantly more susceptible to lethal WNV-NS5-E218A infection than those receiving control chow (Fig. 3a) . Weight loss was also significantly increased in PLX5622-treated mice (Fig. 3b) . Consistent with this, viral titers measured by plaque assay at 2, 4, 6, and 8 dpi in the olfactory bulb (Fig. 3d) , cortex (Fig. 3e) , cerebellum (Fig. 3f ) , brainstem (Fig. 3g) , and spinal cord (Fig. 3h) were significantly higher in PLX5622-treated compared in control-treated mice infected with WNV-NS5-E218A. As virus was inoculated into the cortex, it was detected there at 2 dpi, followed by spread to the olfactory bulb by 4 dpi, and cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord by 6 dpi. PLX5622 treatment also led to decreased proinflammatory cytokine expression in the cortex at 8 dpi (Fig. 3c) and increased neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus and cerebellum at 6 dpi ( Fig. 3l-p) after i.c. infection with WNV-NS5-E218A.

Statistical significance was calculated using two-way ANOVA with Sidak's multiple comparisons test. For all data: ns, not significant at P < 0.05; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. CTRL: Control; PLX: PLX5622 Funk and Klein Journal of Neuroinflammation (2019) 16:22 As expected, WNV-NS5-E218A was barely detected in the kidney (Fig. 3j) , and the virus was steadily cleared from the serum (Fig. 3k) in both control-and PLX5622-treated mice. However, significantly higher levels of virus were detected in the spleen of PLX5622versus control-treated, WNV-NS5-E218A-infected mice at 4 dpi (Fig. 3i) , which was consistent with data obtained during f.p. infection with WNV-NY. Overall, CSF1R antagonism leads to enhanced mortality and loss of virologic control in both the periphery and CNS regardless of the WNV strain utilized, suggesting a critical role for this molecule in antiviral immunity. Fig. 2 PLX5622-treated mice exhibit increased mortality, increased encephalitis score, and impaired virologic control compared with control mice following peripheral infection with WNV-NY. a-d Mice were fed chow containing PLX5622 or control chow for 2 weeks, then infected with 10 2 or 10 4 PFU via footpad infection, then monitored for (a) mortality, (b) weight loss, and (c, d) encephalitis score for up to 25 dpi. a Survival curves show a significant increase in mortality in mice treated with PLX5622 compared with control-treated mice infected with either viral inoculum dose, as calculated by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. b Weight was measured daily during acute illness as a measure of illness.

To determine whether alterations in APC populations impact antiviral immune responses, control-and PLX5622-#treated mice were infected via f.p. with WNV-NY (100 PFU). After f.p. infection, WNV-infected cells traffic to draining popliteal lymph nodes (pLN) and stimulate an antiviral immune response [53] . At 4 dpi, a time-point of high serum viral loads (Fig. 2l) , flow cytometric assessment revealed a trend towards decreased CD11c + CD45 + cells in the blood (Fig. 4a-d) and significantly reduced percentages and total numbers of CD11c + CD45 + cells in the pLN of PLX5622-treated compared with control-treated mice ( Fig. 4k-n) . There was no difference in numbers or percentages of MHCII + CD11c + CD45 + cells in either blood or pLN ( Fig. 4e -g, o-q); however, the percentages of CD11c + CD45 + cells in the blood positive for co-stimulatory molecule CD80 + was significantly decreased in PLX5622versus control-treated mice (Fig. 4h-j) . In the pLN, the numbers and percentages of CD11c + CD45 + cells positive for co-stimulatory molecule CD86 were significantly reduced in PLX5622-treated mice compared with control mice (Fig. 4r-t) . The impact of CSF1R antagonism on CD80 and CD86 expression appears to be tissuedependent as the blood showed no difference in APCs expressing CD86 and the pLN showed no difference in APCs expressing CD80 (Additional file 7). Together, these data indicate that CSF1R antagonism decreases the expression of co-stimulatory B7 molecules on peripheral APC populations. Because infectious virus was detected in the spleens of mice infected i.c. with WNV-NS5-E218A (Fig. 3i) , splenic APCs were analyzed using flow cytometry at 8 dpi. Results indicated no significant difference in the numbers or percentages of MHCII + CD11c + CD45 + cells in the spleens of PLX5622-treated mice compared with control-treated mice (Fig. 5a-c) . However, splenic APCs collected from PLX5622-treated mice exhibited significantly reduced populations of cells expressing co-stimulatory molecules CD80 (Fig. 5d-f ) and CD86 (Fig. 5g -i) compared with control-treated mice. Furthermore, splenic MHCII + CD11c + CD45 + cells showed significant reduction in the expression level of CD86 (Fig. 5l, m) and non-significant reduction of CD80 (Fig. 5j, k) in PLX5622-treated compared with control-treated mice. This correlated with a small, but significant increase in the numbers of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, but no difference in numbers or percentages of WNV-specific NS4B tetramer staining or CD69 positivity in spleens of PLX5622-treated mice compared with control-treated mice infected i.c. with WNV-NS5-E218A (Additional file 8). Together, these data indicate that CSF1R antagonism reduces the activation of inflammatory responses in peripheral APCs even without significant depletion.

Microglia are hypothesized to act as immediate responders to CNS pathogens as resident APCs that coordinate intra-parenchymal adaptive immune response [54] . Previous studies indicated that clearance of WNV in the CNS requires antiviral CD8 + T cells [19, 32, 55] , and that microglia, astrocytes, and neurons express chemokines that attract mononuclear cells to the CNS [21, 56, 57] . To determine the impact of CSF1R antagonism on recruitment of these cells to the CNS, leukocytes isolated from the cortices of WNV-NS5-E218A-infected (See figure on previous page.) Fig. 3 CSF1R antagonism increases mortality and CNS viral burdens during i.c. infection with WNV-NS5-E218A. Mice were fed chow containing PLX5622 or control chow for 2 weeks, infected i.c. with WNV-NS5-E218A at 10 4 PFU, then monitored for a mortality and b weight loss for up to 25 dpi. a Survival curves show a significant increase in mortality in mice treated with PLX5622 compared with control as calculated by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. b Weight was measured daily during acute illness as a measure of illness. After death, the last measured weight was carried through to the end of the experiment. Significantly greater weight loss was measured in PLX5622-treated mice compared with controls as calculated by two-way ANOVA with matched values comparing group means without multiple comparisons. For a and b, data represent the compilation of two independent experiments with 10 mice per group. c At 8 dpi, cortical brain tissue was extracted and relative transcript levels in tissue homogenates were measured by SYBR qRT-PCR for indicated cytokines. Data for individual mice were normalized to Gapdh. Data are presented as mean ± SEM of three to five mice from one experiment. Statistical significance between treatment groups for each cytokine was calculated by t test. d-j Tissue viral loads were measured by plaque assay at 2, 4, 6, and 8 dpi in control (black) or PLX5622-treated (red) mice. k Serum viral loads as measured by qRT-PCR. d-k Data are presented as scatter plots with each mouse represented by a dot with the mean indicated by a line. For d-k, data represent the compilation of two-independent experiments with 10 mice per group. Dotted lines in d-k indicate assay limit of detection. l-o Representative confocal microscopic images of Tunel (red), NeuN (green), and DAPI (blue) of hippocampus (l, m) and cerebellum (n, o) of control-(l, n) or PLX5622-treated (m, o) mice infected i.c. with WNV-NS5-E218A at 6 dpi.

Asterisks denote DAPI-and Tunel-positive but NeuN-negative nuclei. p Quantification of confocal microscopic images for number of DAPI-positive nuclei positive for Tunel and NeuN in the hippocampus (Hpc), cerebellum (Cb), and brainstem (Bs). The number of Tunel+ NeuN+ nuclei per high-power field (HPF) was quantified from three to six images captured at × 40 per brain region across two separate brain sections for each of five independent mice collected in one experiment. Each symbol represents the average number for an individual mouse, with bar indicating mean ± SEM. Statistical significance was calculated using two-way ANOVA with Sidak's multiple comparisons test. For all data: ns, not significant at P < 0.05; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ****P < 0.0001 mice were assessed by flow cytometry at 8 dpi. As expected, CD45 lo CD11b + (P1) population, which is primarily microglia [58] , remained significantly depleted in the PLX5622-treated compared with control-treated mice (Fig. 6a-c) . The population of CD45 hi CD11b + (P2), which is primarily infiltrating monocytes/macrophages [58] , were non-significantly reduced in the PLX5622-treated compared with control-treated mice. However, the number of CD45 hi CD11b neg (P3) lymphocyte population [58] were non-significantly elevated in PLX5622-treated compared with control mice, though the percentage of this population was significantly elevated (Fig. 6a-c) . This increase was largely due to elevated numbers of CD8 + T cell infiltration in PLX5622-treated mice (Fig. 6d-f ). Though there was no significant difference in the percentage of CD8 + T cells specific for the WNV immunodominant peptide between PLX5622 and control-treated mice, there were significantly more WNV-specific CD8 + T cells isolated from PLX5622 compared with control-treated cortex ( Fig. 6g-i) . Despite the increased infiltration of WNV-specific CD8 + T cells in PLX5622-treated mice, the percentages of cells expressing early activation marker CD69 and their level of expression were significantly reduced in PLX5622-treated compared with control-treated mice ( Fig. 6j-m) . Additionally, the percentage of WNV-specific CD8 + T cells positive for CD160 as well as the level of CD160 expression, which is specifically expressed on highly activated CD8 + T cells [59] , were reduced in PLX5622-treated compared with control-treated mice. However, the numbers of NS4B+CD8+ cells positive for either CD69 or CD160 were non-significantly elevated in PLX5622-treated compared with control-treated cortices (Fig. 6l, p) due to the increased numbers of NS4B +CD8+ cells. Because numbers of infiltrating WNV-specific CD8 + T cells derived from the CNS of PLX5622-treated animals were increased, we hypothesized that their lack of local reactivation may be the result of loss of co-stimulatory signals and/or inflammatory cytokines (Fig. 3c) in the CNS. In order to distinguish resident microglia from infiltrating monocytes/macrophages, CNS myeloid cells were examined for expression of the microglia-specific marker P2RY12 (Fig. 7a) . Infiltrating monocytes/ macrophages were then identified via gating of P2RY12 neg CD11b + cells (Fig. 7b) . Populations of both CNS-derived P2RY12 + CD45 + microglia (P1, Fig. 7a ) and CD11b + P2RY12 neg CD45 + monocytes/macrophages (P2, Fig. 7b ) were reduced in PLX5622-treated compared with control-treated mice (Fig. 7i, j) . While no differences in the overall number of cells expressing MHCII were observed in P2RY12 + CD45 + , a significant reduction of MHCII + CD11b + P2RY12 neg CD45 + was seen (Fig. 7c, d,  l) . This corresponded with a relative increase in the percentage of MHCII + cells in both P2RY12 + CD45 + and CD11b + P2RY12 neg CD45 + populations due to the decreased numbers of total P2RY12 + CD45 + and CD11b + P2RY12 neg CD45 + cells in the cortices of PLX5622-treated mice compared with control-treated mice (Fig. 7k) . However, the numbers of P2RY12 + CD45 + cells expressing B7 co-stimulatory signals CD80 and CD86 were significantly reduced in the CNS of PLX5622-treated mice compared with control-treated animals ( Fig. 7e-h, m-p) . The percentage of remaining P2RY12 + CD45 + cells expressing CD80 or CD86 were not reduced (Fig. 7m, o) ; however, the percentage of remaining CD11b + P2RY12 neg CD45 + cells expressing CD86 was significantly reduced (Fig. 7o) , similar to results seen in peripheral APCs (Figs. 4, 5) Together, these data suggest that resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages are important sources of CD80 and CD86 in the CNS, and PLX5622 treatment depletes these cellular sources of co-stimulatory molecules.

Recent studies have reported increased viral titers in the CNS of mice treated with CSF1R antagonists [36, 60, 61] ; however, the mechanisms underlying this loss of virologic control and the effects on peripheral immune responses have not been well characterized. We sought to determine the role of CSF1R signaling in viral clearance of both systemic and neurotropic infection. Our results indicate that antagonism of CSF1R signaling limits virologic control within the CNS via reduction of critical APCs that express co-stimulatory B7 molecules, CD80 and CD86, necessary (See figure on previous page.) Fig. 4 CSF1R antagonism reduces response of APCs in peripheral immune compartments following peripheral infection with WNV-NY. Mice were fed PLX5622 or control chow for 2 weeks, then infected via f.p. with WNV-NY (100 PFU). At 4 dpi, leukocytes were isolated from blood (a-j) and draining popliteal LNs (k-t). a, k Representative flow cytometry plots of CD11c expression on CD45 + -gated cells and b, l fluorescence minus one (FMO) gating controls. c, m Quantification of percentages and d, n total numbers of CD11c + CD45 + cells. e, o Representative flow cytometry plots of MHCII + expression on CD11c + CD45 + cells. f, p Quantification of percentages and g, q total numbers of MHCII + CD11c + CD45 + cells. h Representative flow cytometry plots of CD86 + expression on CD11c + CD45 + cells. i Quantification of percentages and j total numbers of CD86 + CD11c + CD45 + cells. r Representative flow cytometry plots of CD80 + expression on CD11c + CD45 + cells. s Quantification of percentages and t total numbers of CD80 + CD11c + CD45 + cells.

Data shown represent analysis from one experiment with three to five mice per group. Statistical significance was calculated using unpaired t test in all panels except d and n, which used two-way ANOVA with Sidak's multiple comparisons test. For all data: ns, not significant at P < 0.05; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01 for local reactivation of antiviral CD8 + T cells. Our data also indicate that CSF1R antagonism reduces expression of co-stimulatory B7 molecules on peripheral APCs, contributing to loss of virologic control in the periphery and dissemination of virus to the CNS. As previously reported, WNV-NY inoculated into mice via f.p. is detected first within the olfactory bulb then spreads caudally through the cerebral cortex to the brain stem with significant virus not detected in the cerebellum until 8 dpi [20] . CSF1R antagonism with PLX5622 leads to increased viral replication within each of these CNS regions and also in the peripheral organs: the spleen, kidney, and serum.

For quantification panels, each symbol represents an individual control-(black) or PLX5622-treated (red) mouse, and bars indicate mean ± SEM. Data presented are the compilation of two independent experiments with seven to nine mice per group. Statistical significance was calculated using unpaired t tests with Welch's correction. For all data: ns, not significant at P < 0.05; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001 contrast to CNS titers, the virus is cleared from the spleen and serum by 8 dpi in WNV-infected, control, and PLX5622-treated mice. Notably, we detected expansion of viral tropism with significant viral replication in the kidney of PLX5622-treated mice at 4 and 6 dpi compared with control-treated animals. These data suggest that renal macrophages may be sensitive to CSF1R antagonism, which is consistent with a study utilizing a model of recovery from acute kidney injury in which CSF1R inhibition with GW2580 reportedly decreased both kidney macrophage proliferation and their polarization towards wound-healing phenotypes [62] . In order to better isolate the role of microglia during neurotropic infection, we examined the effect of PLX5622 in an established murine model of CNS infection using an attenuated strain of WNV (WNV-NS5-E218A), which lacks 2′-O-methyltransferase activity, thus increasing sensitivity to IFIT-mediated suppression and limiting virulence in peripheral organs with intact immunity [8, 45, 49] . Mice infected i.c. with WNV-NS5-E218A exhibited increased viral titers in the CNS and increased lethality with PLX5622 treatment compared with control treatment. These data suggest that loss of CNS immunity increases lethality of WNV infection. Clearance of WNV within the CNS requires local reactivation of antiviral CD8 + T cells for efficient T cell-mediated adaptive immune responses [55, 63] . Under homeostatic conditions, microglia express very low levels of co-stimulatory B7 molecules (CD80/CD86); however, microglia upregulate expression of these molecules in response to inflammatory cytokines [54, 64] . Our results show PLX5622 treatment decreased expression of these molecules by depleting their cellular sources in the CNS, which include both resident microglia and infiltrating monocytes/macrophages. In the periphery, PLX5622 also reduced cellular expression of B7 molecules on splenic, blood, and pLN APCs. Under certain conditions, other co-stimulatory molecules are able to compensate for the loss of B7 signals in T cell reactivation. For example, expansion of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-specific antiviral T cells can be driven by either alternative co-stimulatory TNFR superfamily members or by enhanced expression of antiviral cytokines, such as high levels of type I IFNs [65] . However, during WNV encephalitis, PLX5622 treatment also significantly decreased transcriptional expression of both TNF and IFNβ. Together, our results indicate that CSF1R antagonism contributes impaired local reactivation of antiviral T cells within the CNS by depleting co-stimulatory signals including both B7 molecules and inflammatory cytokines.

In addition to augmenting antiviral T cell activation, many cytokines have essential protective roles during WNV infection. Infected human monocyte-derived macrophages release IL-8, IFNα, IFNβ, and TNF [66, 67] . Microglia become activated in response to neurotropic WNV infection and upregulate expression of CXCL10, CXCL1, CCL5, CCL3, CCL2, TNF, and IL-6 [18] . Neurons and astrocytes in WNV-infected brains also release proinflammatory mediators including CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10, IL1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF, which promote lymphocyte trafficking to the CNS [19] [20] [21] . In fact, results from a recent study demonstrated that peripheral infection with WNV increased CNS expression of chemokines important for lymphocyte trafficking, including CCL2, CCL7, CXCL9, and CXCL10, in PLX5622-treated mice compared with control-treated mice [61] . Type I IFN response is widely accepted as the most immediate antiviral host response, essential for controlling viral replication during the initial infection. Mice lacking type I IFN signaling are highly vulnerable to uncontrolled WNV replication, exhibiting 100% mortality [68] . Clearance of viral infections, however, requires additional immune response including type II IFN, i.e., IFNγ, which is produced by activated CD8 + T cells. Mice deficient in IFNγ show higher peripheral viral load, increased CNS infection, and increased lethality [69] . Data described here show significantly decreased cytokine expression in PLX5622-treated mice, which may also contribute to the loss of virologic control via the above-described mechanisms.

The exact role of microglia during viral infection has been difficult to define because infiltrating monocytes can mask the impact of resident microglia. In a previous report, IL34 −/− mice, which have significantly reduced development of microglia, are more susceptible to lethal infection after WNV-NS5-E218A i.c. inoculation [36] . Similar to results reported here, IL34 −/− mice exhibited increased neuronal death compared with wildtype controls. In contrast with PLX5622-treated mice, IL34 −/− mice exhibited similar levels of viral burden compared with wildtype controls in the brain at 3 and 6 dpi. Numbers of infiltrating monocytes/macrophages and WNV-specific T cells were also similar between IL34 −/− and wildtype controls; however, the authors did not investigate antiviral T cell activation in this model [36] . In another model of flavivirus encephalitis, in which suckling mice were infected with dengue virus, depletion of microglia with liposome-encapsulated clodronate resulted in increased viral replication and reduced infiltration of IFNγ + CD8 + T cells [70] . Here, we report no reduction in CD8 + T cell infiltration; however, this difference may be due to the age of mice, virus, and/or method of microglial depletion. Another recent study reported use of PLX5622 in a model of neuroattenuated murine corona virus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Similar to our results, PLX5622 treatment resulted in increased viral replication and lethality. In contrast to our results, PLX5622 treatment reduced expression of MHCII on microglia and macrophages and reduced CD4 + T cell response [60] . While CD4 + T cells can improve CD8 + T cell response, the dependence of CD8 + T cells on CD4 + T cells varies by virus, antigen exposure, tissue environment, and effector sites [71] . In models of MHV encephalitis, control of viral replication requires a collaborative effort between CD4 + and CD8 + T cells [71] . However, when virus replication induces activation of APCs, activation of CD8 + T cells is relatively CD4 + T cell-independent [71] .

Recently, chronic activation of innate immune response by microglia is believed to be a major contributor to neurodegenerative conditions [72] . Genetic studies have confirmed the relevance of inflammatory response in common neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis, indicating that neuroinflammation is likely implicated in the primary pathogenesis, rather than a secondary response [73] . We and others have reported that microglia impact neurocognitive function by executing complement-mediated synapse elimination [8, 74, 75] . Because of the neurological consequences of microglial activation, researchers have attempted to use CSF1R antagonism to deplete microglia in a variety of models to improve neurological function, including traumatic brain injury [38, 39] , brain irradiation [50] , myelin-induced catatonia [76] , experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [40] , and Alzheimer's disease [41] . However, our results indicate that CSF1R antagonism may ultimately be detrimental to brain health due to loss of innate and adaptive immune response in the CNS, as well as decreased peripheral APC activation. Thus, in assessing the benefit of CSF1R antagonism, it will be important to consider the diminished immune response in both the CNS and peripheral immune compartments.

Molecular Sciences Review B Cells and Antibodies in Kawasaki Disease

The etiology of Kawasaki disease (KD), the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children, is currently unknown. Epidemiology supports a relationship of KD to an infectious disease. Several pathological mechanisms are being considered, including a superantigen response, direct invasion by an infectious etiology or an autoimmune phenomenon. Treating affected patients with intravenous immunoglobulin is effective at reducing the rates of coronary aneurysms. However, the role of B cells and antibodies in KD pathogenesis remains unclear. Murine models are not clear on the role for B cells and antibodies in pathogenesis. Studies on rare aneurysm specimens reveal plasma cell infiltrates. Antibodies generated from these aneurysmal plasma cell infiltrates showed cross-reaction to intracellular inclusions in the bronchial epithelium of a number of pathologic specimens from children with KD. These antibodies have not defined an etiology. Notably, a number of autoantibody responses have been reported in children with KD. Recent studies show acute B cell responses are similar in children with KD compared to children with infections, lending further support of an infectious disease cause of KD. Here, we will review and discuss the inconsistencies in the literature in relation to B cell responses, specific antibodies, and a potential role for humoral immunity in KD pathogenesis or diagnosis.

Kawasaki disease (KD), also known as Kawasaki syndrome, is the leading cause of acquired cardiac disease in children [1] . Diagnosis is purely clinical, as there are no adequately specific or sensitive tests available. The 'classic' diagnosis involves five days of fever and having four of the five following criteria: Mucous membrane inflammation, rash, hands and feet swelling, conjunctivitis, and a solitary inflamed lymph node mass [2] [3] [4] [5] . If left untreated, roughly one-quarter of the children meeting clinical criteria will go on to have coronary artery inflammation, including aneurysms. Incomplete cases, those which do not fulfill four of five of the classic criteria, have similar risk of coronary aneurysms [6] . Treating affected patients with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) reduces the rates of coronary aneurysms, with a minority seemingly resistant to treatment [2] [3] [4] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Although most aneurysms resolve, some defects are retained. Initial studies done on adults with a history of KD implies there is a greater lifetime risk of cardiac issues and early mortality [11] [12] [13] [14] . To add to the diagnostic confusion, several infectious etiologies have also been independently associated with aneurysms [15] . It remains a frustrating diagnosis because of the unknown etiology, clinical variability, lack of specific testing, and unclear pathogenesis.

There appears to be a genetic influence in exhibiting KD. Incidence is higher in some genetic backgrounds and consistently appears in males greater than females within those backgrounds [16] . By age five in the United States, 1 in 1000 African-American children and 1 in 2000 Caucasian children will have been affected [17] [18] [19] . In general, Asians have a much higher rate of KD, this is especially evident in Japanese children, whose lifetime incidence rate is near 1% [20] . This predisposition holds even for those persons of Japanese heritage raised in foreign lands, such as the United States [16] .

The etiology of KD is unknown [4, 21, 22] . However, there is a proposed relation to an infectious agent. Epidemiological evidence for this comes from the fact that there are seasonal peaks of KD during winter and spring months and outbreaks have been described [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Siblings have a higher rate of KD than the general population; usually cases are within the first year [29] , and can be as high as up to 50% of cases within 10 days of each other [30] . Recent studies show a lower incidence in breastfed infants [31] and KD is rare in both newborns and individuals over five years of age. This implies a maternally derived protective immunity to a ubiquitous infectious agent [32] . This phenomenon is similar to epidemiological findings with human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) infections. In fact, HHV-6 is one of several potential etiologies that have been proposed as the cause of KD [11, 16] . Other notable infectious agents include other Herpesviridae (Epstein Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus), human coronavirus (New Haven), retroviruses, Parvovirus B19, bocavirus, and bacterial infections such as staphylococci, streptococci, Bartonella, and Yersinia infections. Some of these agents have been independently associated with aneurysm formation [15] . Epstein Barr virus particularly is associated with coronary aneurysms [33] . Several non-infectious agents have also been proposed such as carpet shampoos, mercury and living near bodies of water [11, 16] . Additionally, the recent report of tropospheric wind patterns correlating with outbreaks in Japan would not be consistent with many of the viruses that have been proposed [21, 34, 35] . These reports imply a relationship to an environmental antigen, as either a priming or inciting event.

If a ubiquitous childhood virus is the cause of KD, the mode of entry would likely be a common mode of infection such as fecal-oral or respiratory spread. To note, mild upper respiratory symptoms have been described in up to 35% of cases [36] with rare but more significant pulmonary disease also being reported [37] . Additionally, outbreaks in the United States have been associated with preceding viral illness [38] . Notably, however, concomitant respiratory viruses are only shown in 9% of cases [39] , and in the same study that showed 35% with respiratory symptoms, 61% were noted to have gastrointestinal complaints.

It is possible that there is not one cause of KD, but multiple etiologies that result in similar pathogenesis. This may explain the clinical variability and lack of a definitive agent, however, the low recurrence rate even in high prevalence areas speaks against a large number of causes [40] . A superantigen response was considered by numerous groups [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . Certain bacterial infections contain proteins that non-specifically bind effector cell receptors causing a more generalized polyclonal expansion and inflammation, termed a superantigen effect. Polyclonality of T cell receptor usage has been shown in KD [47, 48] ; however, the reports are variable as to which subset of T cell receptors are expanded [49] . Other studies support a traditional oligoclonal response consistent with an immune response against a specific etiologic agent. Oligoclonal expansion of CD8+ T cells [50] and peripheral IgM+ B cell responses have been demonstrated [5, 51] , and IGG+ clonality is seen in studies from our own laboratory (unpublished). Numerous other studies have not shown superantigen-associated expansions of cell subsets [50, 52, 53] . This concept is reviewed extensively elsewhere [45] .

In a recent network and pathway analysis, responses were consistent with global activation of the immune response [54] . Although genome wide searches and similar techniques have not been definitive, genes involved with B cell activation, such as CD40 and the B lymphocyte kinase (BLK), have been identified [55, 56] . There is a growing body of literature implicating specific B cell responses in the pathogenesis [57] . In this review we will focus on the literature surrounding these recent reports of antibody reactive cellular inclusions and B cell involvement.

A number of pharmacologic agents have been used during the inflammatory phase of KD. Treatment with IVIG in KD patients can inhibit coronary aneurysm formation, implying a role for antibodies in disease pathogenesis. However, it is unclear how IVIG actually functions in this setting and if specific antibody responses are responsible for pathogenesis. Potential functions of IVIG include: Replacement for deficient specific protective antibody, anti-idiotype response against pathologic antibodies, B cell downregulation, upregulation of regulatory T cells, downregulation of neutrophil function, downregulation of dendritic cell function, and superantigen neutralization. Recent reviews have explored these functions [58, 59] . The main treatment modalities used for refractory treatment are steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies; all of which have broad immunological effects [60, 61] . Success with anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies seemingly argues against a significant role of B cells, as this would effectively release a suppressive action of TNF on B cell proliferation. However, calcineurin inhibition would have the opposite effect by limiting T-cell help to B cells [62] . Limited reports of treatment with anti-B cell monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD20) also support a role for B cell activation in KD pathogenesis [63] . Interluekin-1 (IL 1), has long been known to affect B cell activity [64] , but it has a very broad array of inflammatory responses [58] . Notably, there is support in the lactobacillus casei mouse model for IL-1 playing a role [65] . Applicable clinical trials are listed in Table 1 . Na-not applicable; z-score-standard deviations from the mean.

The first KD model system developed depended on intraperitoneal Candida injections in susceptible mouse strains [72] . This is shown to have a superantigen response mechanism. Similarly, mice developed coronary artery inflammation after intraperitoneal injection with Lactobacillus casei cell wall extract. Pathogenesis in this model parallels KD in that younger mice are more predisposed to develop arteritis and there is a favorable response to IVIG treatment. This disease exhibits mostly a T-cell infiltrate in coronary arterial specimens [42] . In fact, in both RAG-1 [73] and TCR-α [74] deficient mice, this arteritis is diminished [75] . Other models depend on immune complex deposition. This was observed after bovine serum albumin injection into rabbits, which exhibited a disease similar to serum sickness [76] . A number of the model systems have granulomatous changes, which have variably been seen in human specimens [77] . Presently, there is not a model system consistent with direct infectious coronary artery invasion nor that exactly replicates the pathologic changes seen in humans [78] . Considering that the cause in humans is unknown, it is unclear if any of these models of arteritis are truly applicable. Although most data from model systems are supportive of superantigen involvement, studies from human peripheral lymphocyte responses are variable and inconsistent [79] .

The lack of robust studies on human pathological studies on cellular infiltrates in KD is likely explained by the necessary reliance on autopsy specimens. A number of studies have noted lymphocytic infiltrates in samples from later timepoints. Limited studies have shown that acute infiltrates develop over time with late fibrosis occurring in the intima and adventia layers. Neutrophils seem to be the predominant initial cell infiltrate [80] . However, in a series of six specimens, neutrophil infiltration was quickly followed by lymphocyte infiltrates, then mixed lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltrates were demonstrated later, near day 19 of illness [81] . In a separate series (8 specimens), early B lymphocyte infiltration after initial neutrophil infiltrate was confirmed [80] . Prominent nodular infiltrates, similar to atherosclerotic plaque formation, have also been described, but these appear to occur at later timepoints (>3 weeks). These infiltrates consisted of T cells, macrophages, B cells and prevalent IgM+ plasma cells, with less frequent IgA+ plasma cells. The authors compare these to similar B cell rich lesions driven by both superantigens and specific infectious antigens [82] .

A pathologic study on seven samples from later timepoints (most greater than two weeks after beginning symptoms of KD) revealed fewer IgM+ plasma cells compared to more prevalent IgA+ plasma cells. These were seemingly specific and prominent in seven KD biopsy specimens, however the fourteen control specimens were from autopsies that succumbed generally from non-inflammatory and non-cardiac syndromes. Notably, mature memory and immature B cells (CD20+ cells) were lacking [83] . Due to the late time point of these specimens, this may not be inconsistent with other reports reviewed previously. The lack of CD20+ B cells was theorized to be from early coronary infiltration of CD20+ B cells followed by immediate switching of these B cells to plasma cells [84] . This increase in infiltrative IgA+ plasma cells could not be explained by a generalized increase in peripheral IgA+ cell, as none was shown in acute or convalescent KD [3] . The largest study, relying on electron microscopic studies, suggests that there is an early necrotizing arteritis indicative of an acute viral infection, followed by a vasculitis, then luminal myofibroblast proliferation [77] . Although this study had 32 samples, it only had three within two weeks of disease onset and a number of findings were different than previous studies. Collection and study of these types of rare samples should continue.

Although plasma cell infiltration as outlined above is intriguing, a similar pathological response is seen in a number of inflammatory conditions such as anti-N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) encephalitis [85] , primary sclerosing cholangitis, [86] multiple sclerosis, [87] and responses to tumors [88] . Some, such as IgA nephropathy and rheumatoid pericarditis have shown plasma cell infiltration and IgA staining [89] . In KD it is proposed that these plasma cells mature in situ from initial B cell infiltration. Monoclonal B cell infiltrates have been shown in other disorders [90] . Additionally, in situ lymphoid neogenesis is described in numerous inflammatory and infectious disease systems [91] [92] [93] [94] and some oncologic processes [95, 96] . Localized inflammation and cellular damage may lead to exposure of previously hidden self-antigens setting off a localized autoimmune cascade [97] . From pure pathological studies, it is unclear if the clonality of the IgA+ plasma cell infiltrates seen in KD represents a global inflammatory response or a specific antibody driven response against an invasive pathogen.

Unfortunately, there have also been few published reports on the peripheral blood dynamics during KD. Reports do show increased IgA immune complexes and levels [9] , although immune complexes do not necessarily portend worse prognosis [98] . Peripheral lymphocyte analysis did not indicate an increase in IgA+ cells in acute, subacute and convalescent KD patient samples [3] . In fact, there was actually a relative paucity of IgA+ peripheral B cells from acute KD samples compared to controls. Interestingly, the lack of IgA+ peripheral B cells continued through convalescence. Other studies have shown no changes in acute and convalescent B cell subgroups, but increases in CD69+ natural killer and γδ T cells were observed [99] . Recently, the B cell marker CD 19+ was used to show an increase in both number of B cells and relative percentage in acute KD compared to controls. The percent of 'activated' CD86+ B cells was also significantly elevated [100] . There was also a global increase in the ability of B cells to secrete IgM, IgG, and IgA after TLR-9 stimulation, something that has been previously unexplored in the literature. Overall, in the small number of studies relating to the peripheral blood B cell compartment, there is not a consensus as to whether B cells are responsible for enhanced pathogenesis.

Although, total numbers of cells do not show consistent results, clonal expansion within the B cell compartment can be studied. A specific immune response to an agent typically has an initial inherent immune component that leads to antigen presentation to effector cells. Receptors on the effector cell surface (T-cell receptors in T cells and Immunoglobulin (IG), or antibody, in B cells) bind specific targeted areas of the agent, termed epitopes. Specific recognition by T and B lymphocytes leads to stimulation, lymphocyte replication and clonal expansion; what is termed an oligoclonal response. Oligoclonal expansion is shown in peripheral IgM+ B cells in KD [5] . Detailed pathological studies have revealed what are termed oligoclonal plasma cell infiltrates in KD arterial specimens [101] , leading to the cloning of antibody J and association with the presence of the spheroid ICIs as previously discussed [102, 103] .

Antibodies J and A were created from non-native pairing of the most prevalent sequences from reported plasma cell infiltrates (3 repeats of heavy chain and duplicates of light chains) [101, 104] . On binding bronchial epithelium specimens from children with KD, antibodies J and A identified intracellular inclusions (ICI) [51, 57] . In a subsequent study, 26% of the control group, composed primarily of adult patients, had similar inclusion bodies that were bound by antibody J [105] . Although many viruses can reactivate during stress (Herpesviridae family) or are considered 'slow' viral infections [106] , the failure of numerous attempts to identify a specific infectious agent argues against such a persistent infection [57] . There remains the possibility that this is a difficult to culture virus, such as coronavirus, which had also enjoyed a short-lived consideration as the cause of KD [107] .

The study that created antibodies A and J described a total of 44 heavy chain sequences and 61 light chain sequences. Other antibodies expressed, D and L, and showed no binding to ICIs. There was generally a lack of oligoclonal response with just six light chains duplicated and only the J heavy (3 times) and three other heavy chains duplicated. As these antibodies were created with non-native heavy and light chain pairings, they may have non-specific interactions [108] . This is one of the major challenges in the burgeoning bispecific antibody field [109] . Evidence of in situ maturation of antibodies, such as A and J, also does not preclude such an antibody targeting a self-antigen. Notably, two other rare clones (only one transcript each from the 44 sequence reads) showed weak binding to the same spheroid ICIs. One of these weak binding antibodies (antibody E) also bound plasma cells directly and was subsequently shown to bind kappa chains of IG. This highlights the non-specific autoimmune potential of antibodies from these types of pathologic infiltrates, which will be reviewed later.

Electron micrograph evaluation of autopsy samples from three individuals who had KD revealed ICIs and "virus-like particles" (VLPs) [103] . Unfortunately, these three structures all appeared to have different morphologies and variable association with the ICI [110] . RNA contained in KD sample ICIs was further analyzed by using laser-capture micro-dissection and subsequent 454 sequencing. No homologies to known viral RNA sequences were shown. Specifically, of the 411,561 nucleic acid reads done by 454 sequencing, only 1006 did not have significant GenBank homology [105] . This lack of homology to known viral sequences and paucity of unknown sequence is also not supportive of these being VLPs or viral aggregation of an unknown virus. The limitation to only autopsy specimens, lack of similar findings in other pathological reports, lack of VLP correlation to ICI, and lack of genetic specificity in the included RNA argues against these being related to the etiology of KD.

Because the ICIs observed in KD specimens are identified by recombinant antibodies synthesized from pathologic KD specimens, the authors of these studies conclude that these inclusions are of viral origin, and specifically related to the etiological agent of KD [51, 105] . However, it is possible that these ICIs could be any number of host-derived functional structures that are typically observed as protein aggregates. Aggresomes, one such structure, are involved in shuttling of misfolded proteins during cellular stress [111] . Aggresomes are frequently observed as large intracellular aggregates of host proteins and are frequently surrounded by a "cage" of intermediate filament proteins. Available evidence suggests KD ICIs and aggresomes are distinct structures since the ICIs observed in the two autopsy specimens lacked a cytokeratin cage [103] . However, cytokeratin cages are not definitive of aggresomes and their presence may depend on the cell type. More frequently, vimentin is used as an intermediate filament marker for aggresomal cages. Because the expression of vimentin varies in bronchiole epithelial cells [112] , other common markers of aggresomes could have been studied, such as ubiquitin, HSP70, HSP40, and proteasomal subunits [111] . Unfortunately, none of these markers were tested. In addition, there are several other large intracellular protein aggregates such as stress granules, p-bodies, prion-aggregates, aggresome-like induced structures (ALIS) and autophagosomes [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] . It is possible the ICI identified by antibodies A and J are one of these structures; perhaps the manifestation of KD is the improper regulation of one of these processes.

In addition to protein, the ICIs observed in the limited bronchial epithelial samples were also partially composed of RNA. While the RNA could be of viral origin it is important to note that many of the host-derived intracellular protein aggregates previously noted also contain host mRNA [113, 114, 116, 117] . It is reasonable to conclude that if the ICIs observed in KD patients were related to one of these structures, they would positively stain for RNA.

As reviewed, the similarly cloned antibody E was shown to bind a self-antigen [102] . The autoimmune aspects of KD have recently been reviewed [118] . Self-antigen responses to a variety of targets have actually been well described in KD. These include recent reports of antibody responses to type III collagen, myosin [119] , cardiolipin [120] , alpha-enolase [121] , and anti-endothelial antibodies. Anti-endothelial antibodies are particularly interesting as these are seen in other disorders, such as SLE and renal allograft rejection [122] . Other vasculitides have also been associated with anti-endothelial antibodies. These have been shown to cause upregulation of E-selectin, VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and NFκB [123] . Responses to these antibodies include upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis of the endothelial cells.

In KD subjects, a polyclonal antibody response against endothelial cells has been described [124] . Cytokines, such as IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF, that would be present during generalized inflammation, facilitate a pathological anti-endothelial response of circulating IgG and IgM antibodies associated with acute KD [125, 126] . In cell lysis assays, pathogenesis was eliminated by clearing the serum through anti-IgG and anti-IgM sepharose columns supportive of no role of peripheral anti-IgA responses. This does not eliminate the potential role of intra-tissue IgA+ plasma cell development in pathogenesis as has been postulated [83, 102] . Other studies support significant IgM mediated cytotoxicity against endothelial cells in KD patients [127] . Prevalent IgM anti-endothelial responses in KD have also been shown without cytokine stimulation [127, 128] . In a mouse model system, anti-endothelial antibody responses were replicated, but these did not demonstrate cardiac vascular involvement [129] . The case report of anti-B cell monoclonal antibody success was proposed by the authors to be due to the downregulation of such an anti-endothelial invasive effect [63] . Although intriguing, it remains unknown if these anti-endothelial responses actually contribute to the vasculitis in KD and other vasculitides [123] .

Recent data from our laboratory further supports an infectious disease etiology playing a role in KD. Numerous studies show that after an antigenic challenge, vaccination and natural infections, B cells transitioning to plasma cells, termed plasmablasts (PBs), can be seen in the peripheral blood [130, 131] . These can be recognized by surface markers of CD19, downregulation of CD20, and high levels of CD27 and CD38 [3, 132] . In comparison to the general circulating B cell population, PBs are enriched for B cells that contain infection-specific antibodies [133, 134] . This is variable as some studies show massive and high enrichment of PBs targeting the antigen of interest [135, 136] , while other studies show polyspecificity of the PB population and limited enrichment [137] [138] [139] [140] . Immunization studies in adults (tetanus [141] , influenza [132] , and rabies [142] ) show PB have more consistent enrichment for specific antibodies, temporally peak 5-10 days after immunization, and are predictive of later sero-immunity [143] . Elevated circulating peripheral PBs are not specific to infections, as they are elevated in a number of autoimmune diseases and their levels correlate to disease flares [144] . Although certain infections, such as dengue virus, may set off exceedingly high PB levels [145] , PB quantities tend to be significantly higher in autoimmune conditions than levels achieved during vaccination or post-infection. This excessive circulating PB response corresponds to flaring of the underlying inflammatory disease, and specifically correlates with c-reactive protein (CRP) level in studies on ulcerative colitis [145, 146] and IGG4 related disease [147, 148] .

We postulated that if KD is caused by an infection, we should observe a predictable rise of PBs in the peripheral blood. We collected samples from 18 children with KD and 69 febrile controls presenting to the emergency department. Overall, we saw an increase in IGG+ B cells, but not a cumulative increase in B cells [149] . Notably, we did not observe an increase in circulating IgA+ B cells. The result of this study is consistent with the majority of the literature that shows B cell stimulation and increasing peripheral B cell numbers during KD [4, 5, 99, 100] . Both KD and infectious control children showed comparable elevations of PBs compared to controls [149] . Importantly, the levels did not correlate with CRPs and were not excessive, which are characteristics of PB responses in autoimmunity. Unfortunately, only five children had repeat samples. Of these five, all had PB elevations on one or both timepoints, leaving only 3 of 18 KD samples not having a measurable elevation of their PBs in this study generally limited to one timepoint. We are currently collecting samples over multiple timepoints to more thoroughly explore this phenomenon.

Ongoing studies are exploring heavy and light chain usage in B cells and PBs during KD with next generation sequencing techniques. To specifically target an etiology, we have created monoclonal antibodies with pairing of the heavy and light chains utilizing the 10x Genomics ® Single Cell sequencing technology [150] . As an example, from the PB rise of near 11% of circulating B cells seen in subject 24, we created a panel of 946 paired heavy and light chain sequences. From this sample, there are a number of clones with exact sequence repeats (roughly 5%). To assign clonal groups, we analyzed the sequences using CDR3 length and sequences, and compared predicted germline antibody sequences (from IMGT, [151] ). Roughly 40% of clones can be assigned to have clonal relationships. Several of the monoclonal antibodies we generated are presented in Table 2 . We chose these fifteen antibodies to highlight markers that show somatic hypermutation and clonal expansion. These are highlighted by predicted clonal members, isotype switching, nucleotide substitutions from predicted germlines, and increases in the subgroup replacement to silent nucleotide mutation (R/S) ratios. Elevation of this ratio supports clonal selection of affinity matured antibodies which would correlate with an increase in mutations leading to changes in the amino acids, particularly in the antigen binding complementarity determining regions (CDRs) [152] . Work on identifying the protein targets of these antibodies is ongoing. Because of the characteristics seen in these antibodies, we hypothesize these antibodies target the etiology that caused KD in this child. 

The roll of B cells and plasma cells in KD is controversial (summarized Table 3 ). Much of the B cell and antibody data reviewed herein show inconsistent, contradictory or unsubstantiated findings. Pathological specimens and model systems are variably supportive or inconsistent with what is known from human studies. Although B cell and plasma cell infiltration in pathology specimens is intriguing, whether they are bystanders activated by a superantigen effect, are responding to a self-antigen revealed by inflammation, or specific against an infectious etiology, is currently unknown. Like the mouse models and attempts at developing new therapeutics, it is hard to be confident in any one approach without knowledge of the etiology. Although published B cell studies relating to KD are somewhat inconsistent, recent data using advanced sequencing techniques show promise for identification of an etiology. Since KD is a clinical syndrome without a definitive marker of diagnosis, many of the studies may be influenced by "generous" case definitions of the study participants. Most of the studies reviewed do not include detailed clinical information or rigorous case definitions. This is a general problem with the literature in this field; these machinations seem more consistent in clinical trials and epidemiological studies but are rare in bench-science studies. This potential selection bias may be negatively influencing reproducible, definitive findings and conclusions. This is a rich opportunity for clinical investigators. Rigorous studies are needed on those children who present with KD. If any pulmonary findings are found, bronchial washings should be obtained and stored for potential molecular diagnostics. Other samples, such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum, should be taken and banked for future studies. Thorough autopsy evaluation should be pursued on any subjects who succumb during the acute or convalescent phases of KD. Improved reporting and national registries would go a long way in establishing a representative pool of patients. Studies currently ongoing on peripheral cytokine profiles, B cells and PBs may show a consistent marker to help define who has KD. A correlative diagnostic marker, possibly even antibody derived, would be a highly desirable first step in future studies. 

Analysis of codon usage and nucleotide composition bias in polioviruses

Background: Poliovirus, the causative agent of poliomyelitis, is a human enterovirus and a member of the family of Picornaviridae and among the most rapidly evolving viruses known. Analysis of codon usage can reveal much about the molecular evolution of the viruses. However, little information about synonymous codon usage pattern of polioviruses genome has been acquired to date.

The relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values, effective number of codon (ENC) values, nucleotide contents and dinucleotides were investigated and a comparative analysis of codon usage pattern for open reading frames (ORFs) among 48 polioviruses isolates including 31 of genotype 1, 13 of genotype 2 and 4 of genotype 3.

The result shows that the overall extent of codon usage bias in poliovirus samples is low (mean ENC = 53.754 > 40). The general correlation between base composition and codon usage bias suggests that mutational pressure rather than natural selection is the main factor that determines the codon usage bias in those polioviruses. Depending on the RSCU data, it was found that there was a significant variation in bias of codon usage among three genotypes. Geographic factor also has some effect on the codon usage pattern (exists in the genotype-1 of polioviruses). No significant effect in gene length or vaccine derived polioviruses (DVPVs), wild viruses and live attenuated virus was observed on the variations of synonymous codon usage in the virus genes. The relative abundance of dinucleotide (CpG) in the ORFs of polioviruses are far below expected values especially in DVPVs and attenuated virus of polioviruses genotype 1. Conclusion: The information from this study may not only have theoretical value in understanding poliovirus evolution, especially for DVPVs genotype 1, but also have potential value for the development of poliovirus vaccines.

When molecular sequence data started to be accumulated nearly 20 years ago, it was noted that synonymous codons are not used equally in different genomes, even in different genes of the same genome [1] [2] [3] . As an important evolutionary phenomenon, it is well known that synonymous codon usage bias exists in a wide range of biological systems from prokaryotes to eukaryotes [4, 5] . Codon usage analysis has been applied to prokaryote and eukaryote, such as Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans and human beings [6] [7] [8] . These observed patterns in synonymous codon usage varied among genes within a genome, and among genomes. The codon usage is attributable to the equilibrium between natural selection and mutation pressure [9, 10] . Recent studies of viral codon usage has shown that mutation bias may be a more important factor than natural selection in determining codon usage bias of some viruses, such as Picornaviridae, Pestivirus, plant viruses, and vertebrate DNA viruses [9, [11] [12] [13] . Meanwhile, recent report also showed that the G+C compositional constraint is the main factor that determines the codon usage bias in iridovirus genomes [11, 14] . Analysis of codon usage can reveal much about the molecular evolution or individual genes of the viruses.

Polioviruses belong to the family Picornaviridae and are classified as human enterovirus C (HEV-C) species in the genus Enterovirus according to the current taxonomy [15, 16] . Polioviruses can be divided into three different genotypes: 1, 2 and 3. The genome of each genotypes contains a single positive-stranded RNA with a size of approximately 6 kb consisting of a single large open reading frame (ORF) flanked by 5' and 3' untranslated region [17] .

As we known, the Sabin oral poliovaccine (OPV) was among the best known viral vaccines [18] . It has saved the lives and health of innumerable people, in particular children. However, poliovirus is highly genetically variable. OPV viruses may undergo transformation into circulating highly diverged VDPV, exhibiting properties hardly distinguishable from those of wild polioviruses [19] . So far, little information about synonymous codon usage pattern of polioviruses genome has been acquired to date. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the codon usage analysis on polioviruses (including wild strains, attenuated live vaccine strains and VDPV strains). In this study, we analyzed the codon usage data and base composition of 48 available representative complete ORFs of poliovirus to obtain some clues to the features of genetic evolution of the virus.

A total of 48 poliovirus genomes were used in this study ( Table 1 ). The serial number (SN), genotype, length value, isolated region, GenBank accession numbers, and other detail information about these strains were listed in Table 1 . All of the sequences were downloaded from NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/, and 48 poliovirus genomes were selected in the study. The other sequences with >98% sequence identities were excluded.

The ENC is used to measure the degree of departure from the equal use of synonymous codons of coding regions of polioviruses. The values of the effective number of codon (ENC) range from 20 to 61. In an extremely biased gene where only one codon is used for each amino acid, this value would be 20; if all codons are used equally, it would be 61; and if the value of ENC is greater than 40, the codon usage bias was regarded as low. The values of ENC were obtained by EMBOSS CHIPS program [20] .

Genes, whose codon choice is constrained only by a mutation bias, will lie on or just below the curve of the predicted values. The predicted values of ENC were calculated as

where s represents the given (G+C) 3 % value [21] .

The calculation of the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU)

To investigate the pattern of relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) without the influence of amino acid composition among all polioviruses samples, the RSCU values of codons in each ORF of polioviruses were calculated according to the formula of previous reports [22, 23] .

where g ij is the observed number of the ith codon for jth amino acid which has n i type of synonymous codons. The codon with RSCU value more than 1.0 has positive codon usage bias, while the value <1.0 has relative negative codon usage bias. When RSCU value is equal to 1.0, it means that this codon is chosen equally and randomly.

Because dinucleotide biases can affect codon bias, the relative abundance of dinucleotides in the coding regions of polioviruse genomes was assessed using the method described by Karlin and Burge [24] . A comparison of actual and expected dinucleotide frequencies of the 16 dinucleotides in coding region of the 48 polioviruses genomes was also undertaken. The odds ratio r xy =ƒ xy /ƒ y ƒ x , where ƒ x denotes the frequency of the nucleotide X, ƒ y denotes the frequency of the nucleotide Y, ƒ y ƒ x the expected frequency of the dinucleotide XY and ƒ xy the frequency of the dinucleotide XY, etc., for each dinucleotide were calculated. As a conservative criterion, for r xy > 1.23 (or < 0.78), the XY pair is considered to be of over-represented (or under-represented) relative abundance compared with a random association of mononucleotides.

Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out to analyze the major trend in codon usage pattern in different genomes of polioviruses (excluding non-coding regions). It is a statistical method that performs linear mapping to extract optimal features from an input distribution in the mean squared error sense and can be used by self-organizing neural networks to form unsupervised neural preprocessing modules for classification problems [6] . In order to minimize the effect of amino acid composition on codon usage, each ORF is represented as a 59-dimensional vector. Each dimension corresponds to the RSCU value of one sense codon excluding Met, Trp and three stop codons. Linear regression analysis was used to find the correlation between codon usage bias and gene length. Correlation analysis is used to identify the relationship between codon usage bias and synonymous codon usage pattern. This analysis is implemented based on the Spearman's rank correlation analysis way.

All statistical analyses were carried out using the statistical analysis software SPSS Version 17.0.

In order to investigate the extent of codon usage bias in polioviruses, all RSCU values of different codon in 48 polioviruses strains were calculated. There is only two preferred codons UUG (Leu) and GUG (Val), choosing G at the third position, and most of preferred codons are ended with A ( Table 3) . The values of ENC among these polioviruses ORFs are similar, which vary from 52.609 to 55.105 with a mean value of 53.754 and S.D. of 0.545. The data showed that the extent of codon preference in polioviruses genes was kept basically stable.

The values of A, U, C, G and C+G were compared with the values of A 3 , C 3 , G 3 , U 3 , (G+C) 3 , respectively. An interesting and complex correlation was observed. In detail, the (C+G) 3 have highly significant correlations with A, U, C, G and C+G, respectively, indicating C+G may reflect interaction between mutation pressure and natural selection. However, the A have no correlation with A 3 , G 3 and C 3 , and U have no correlation with A 3 (Table 4 ). Both cases suggested that the nucleotide constraint possibly influence synonymous codon usage of polioviruses. In addition, the correlation between the Axis 1 (calculated by PCA) and the values of A, C, G, U, A 3 , C 3 , G 3 , U 3 , (G+C), (G+C) 3 of each strain was also analyzed. The significant correlation was found between nucleotide compositions and synonymous codon usage to some extent excluding Axis 1 and the value of A ( Table 4 ). The analysis revealed that most of the codon usage bias among ORFs of polioviruses strains was directly related to the base composition. Finally, the ENC-plot [ENC plotted against (G+C) 3 %] was used as a part of general strategy to investigate patterns of synonymous codon usage and all of the spots lie below the expected curve (Figure 1 ). These imply that the codon bias can be explained mainly by an uneven base composition, in other words, by mutation pressure rather than natural selection. Effect of other potential factors on codon usage

Principal component analysis was carried out to identify the codon usage bias among ORFs. From which we could detect one major trend in the Axis 1 which accounted for 20.815% of the total variation, and another major trend in the Axis 2 for 16.273% of the total variation. A plot of the Axis 1 and the Axis 2 of each gene was shown in Additional file 1, Figure S1 . Obviously, those polioviruses belong to the same genotype tends to come together (except strain 48, isolated from Finland). Compared with the scattered groups of polioviruses genotype 1, genotype 2 and 3 strains aggregated more tightly to some degree. Although this graph is a little complex, it seems that there is a clear geographical demarcation in the polioviruses genotype 1 such as the VDPV strains isolated from USA, Dominica, China mainland and Taiwan. These may indicate that geographic is another factor on codon usage bias.

The frequencies of occurrence for dinucleotides were not randomly distributed and no dinucleotides were present at the expected frequencies. And the frequency of CpG and TpA was significantly low at all codon positions for coding region of 48 polioviruses genomes (mean ± S. D. = 0.490 ± 0.012; and mean ± S.D. = 0.748 ± 0.034. both < 0.78). The relative abundance of CpA and TpG also showed slight deviation from the ''normal range'' (mean ± S.D. = 1.253 ± 0.032 and 1.423 ± 0.023, respectively) ( Table 5 ). In addition, the RSCU values of the eight codons containing CpG (CCG, GCG, UCG, ACG, CGC, CGG, CGU, and CGA) were analyzed, to reveal the possible effects of CpG under-represented on codon usage bias. All of these eight codons were not preferential codons and were markedly suppressed. The six codons containing TpA (UUA, CUA, GUA, UAU, UAC and AUA) were suppressed too. Conversely, the RSCU values of the eight codons containing CpA (UCA, CCA, ACA, GCA, CAA, CAG, CAU, CAC) and five codons containing UpG (UUG, GUG, UGU, UGC, CUG) are high, and most of them (8 out of 13) were preferential codons ( Table 2 and Table 5 ). In addition, compared with DVPVs and live attenuated strain of polioviruses genotype 1, the wild viruses has higher frequencies of dinucleotides including CpG (Figure 2 and Table 5 ).

Furthermore, we also performed a linear regression analysis on ENC value and gene length of ORFs of 48 polioviruses genomes. However, there was no significant correlation between codon usage and gene length in these virus genes (Spearman P > 0.05).

Studies of synonymous codon usage in viruses can reveal much about viral genomes [25] . The overall codon usage among 48 ORFs of polioviruses was analyzed in this study. First, the ENC values of all the poliovirus samples were analyzed, and the results showed that the majority of polioviruses do not have a strong codon bias (mean ENC = 53.754 > 40). In addition, together with published data on codon usage bias among some RNA viruses, such as BVDV, H5N1 Table 4 Correlation analysis between the A, U, C, G contents and A 3 , U 3 , C 3 , G 3 influenza virus and SARS-covs with mean values of 51.43, 50.91 and 48.99, respectively, one possible explanation for this is that the weak codon bias of RNA virus is advantageous to replicate efficiently in vertebrate host cells, with potentially distinct codon preferences [26] [27] [28] . Natural selection and mutation pressure are thought to be the main factors that account for codon usage variation in different organisms [29] [30] [31] . In this study, the general association between codon usage bias and base composition suggests that mutational pressure, rather than natural selection is the mainly factors on codon usage pattern of polioviruses.

Codon usage can also be strongly influenced by underlying biases in dinucleotide frequency, which differs greatly among organisms. Specifically, after accounting for dinucleotide biases, the proportion of codon usage bias explained by mutation pressure often increases, as seen in human RNA viruses [25] . Our study revealed that CpG and the eight CpG-containing codons are notably deficient in ORFs of 48 poliovirus genomes. The explanation for the CpG deficiency is immunologic escape. A high CpG content may be detrimental to small DNA (or RNA) viruses, as unmethylated CpGs are recognized by the host's innate immune system (Toll-like receptor 9) as a pathogen signature [32] . As with vertebrate genomes, methylated viral genomes would face a high chance of mutation at CpGs, that would result in a reduction of this dinucleotide [9, 33] . We found that DVPVs and live attenuated virus of genotype 1 have lower frequencies of CpG dinucleotide compare with wild viruses of polioviruses genotype 1. The most popular explanation for lower frequencies of CpG in ORFs of DVPV genomes is that when OPV viruses turning into VDPV genotype 1, a lower frequencies of CpG dinucleotide maybe help VDPV out of the host immunity.

Although it seems speculative and complex, some researchers have found that reduction of the rate of poliovirus protein synthesis through large-scale utilization of codons that are not optimal has caused attenuation of viral virulence by lowering specific infectivity [34] . Therefore, the information from this study may not only have theoretical value in understanding poliovirus evolution (especially for DVPVs genotype 1), but also have practical value for the development the poliovirus vaccine. However, a more comprehensive analysis The range of coding region of 48 polioviruses's relative dinucleotide ratios. b Mean values of coding region of 48 polioviruses's relative dinucleotide ratios ± S.D.

is needed to reveal more information about codon usage bias variation within poliovirus and other responsible factors.

The information from this study may not only help to understand the evolution of the poliovirus, especially for DVPVs genotype 1, but also have potential value for the development of poliovirus vaccines.

Cell-Penetrating Peptides for Antiviral Drug Development

Viral diseases affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide, and the few available drugs to treat these diseases often come with limitations. The key obstacle to the development of new antiviral agents is their delivery into infected cells in vi vo. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are short peptides that can cross the cellular lipid bilayer with the remarkable capability to shuttle conjugated cargoes into cells. CPPs have been successfully utilized to enhance the cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of antiviral molecules, and thereby increase the inhibitory activity of potential antiviral proteins and oligonucleotide analogues, both in cultured cells and in animal models. This review will address the notable findings of these studies, highlighting some promising results and discussing the challenges CPP technology has to overcome for further clinical applications.

Viral diseases affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide, resulting in a devastating toll on human health and socio-economic development. Along with the emergence of newly-recognized human pathogens (the SARS coronavirus, the recent influenza viruses H5N1 and H1N1), the ever-increasing incidence of chronic viral infections caused by HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses continues to increase OPEN ACCESS the global burden of infectious diseases [1, 2] . Vaccines have been developed for some of the most important viral pathogens. Although vaccines against HIV [3] and hepatitis C virus [4] are in clinical phases III and II respectively, there is still little prospect of effective vaccines against these agents. There are enormous challenges to the development of these vaccines, especially since millions of people are already chronically infected with these viruses, which would require therapeutic vaccines for control.

These challenges emphasize the importance of chemotherapy to treat these viral infections [5] . There are around 40 antiviral compounds in clinical use targeting various viral diseases (over half of these drugs are being used in the treatment of patients with HIV infection) while there is no treatment for most acute infections, such as the ones that cause severe illnesses, including hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, and even cancer [6] [7] [8] [9] . Most of the available drugs are of limited efficacy and come with severe side effects [6] . Importantly, antiviral chemotherapy is plagued by the rapid development of drug resistance strains, resulting from the high rate of replication of viruses combined with the low fidelity with which they replicate their genomes [10] .

In view of the modest existing drug arsenal, the continuing threat posed by viral pathogens urgently calls for the development of novel antiviral agents. As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses present formidable challenges to drug development, the biggest being the in vivo delivery of the antiviral drug into the infected cells, with minimum toxicity to the host cells [6] .

Traditional antiviral therapy has relied on small molecules such as protease inhibitors or nucleotide analogues to inhibit viral enzymes. In the last decades, proteins and nucleic acid molecules have shown very promising antiviral properties. However, due to their physical properties, such as size or hydrophilicity, the cellular uptake of these molecules is strongly restricted. The inability of these molecules to cross the cell membrane to reach their intracellular target precludes further clinical application. The cellular delivery of these molecules has thus arisen as a cornerstone for therapeutic development.

Current techniques for cellular delivery of antivirals include targeted liposomes in cell culture and in mice [11] [12] [13] [14] , receptor-mediated endocytosis through antibody binding in cell culture and in mice [15] , retroviral vectors in cell culture [16] , as well as adenoviruses in vaccine delivery [17] . However these techniques present certain limitations and concerns: low efficiency [11, 15] , immunogenicity [14, 15] , stability and rapid clearance in bloodstream [18] for liposomal reagents, and immunogenicity and viral integration on host gene expression for viral vectors [15, 19] .

A novel strategy to efficiently overcome the impermeable cell barrier came from the surprising findings in the late 1980s that certain naturally occurring short peptide sequences have the ability to enter cells when added to culture media. The tat peptide, derived from HIV-1 transcriptional activator protein (tat) [20, 21] , and penetratin, derived from Drosophila antennapedia (Antp) transcription protein [22] , were the first cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) to be described. Tat and penetratin have paved the way to the discovery of other naturally occurring CPPs such as the herpesvirus tegument protein VP22 [23, 24] or the cell wall protein-derived peptide inv3 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis [25, 26] . Chimaeric CPPs such as transportan (a chimera of the neuropeptide galanin and the wasp venom toxin mastoparan) [27] and totally synthetic CPPs such as the model amphipathic peptide (MAP) [28] or arginine oligomers [29] have also been designed and are routinely used. The exact mechanism of cellular uptake is not clear and studies remain controversial. Current models include uptake through transient pore formation, caveolae, clathrindependent endocytosis, and macropinocytosis. Recent data suggest endocytosis as the prevailing model for uptake, although several mechanisms may coexist and differ depending on CPPs [30, 31] .

What makes these peptides very attractive as a delivery system is their ability to promote intracellular uptake of conjugated cargoes [32] . CPPs have successfully improved the cellular uptake of various cargoes including proteins [26, 33] , nucleic acids (oligonucleotides [34, 35] , peptide-nucleic acids [36, 37] , siRNAs [38, 39] ), nanoparticules [40] and liposomes [41] in a wide range of cells: mainly in mammalian cells, but also in bacteria [37, 42] , yeasts [42] and protozoan parasites [43, 44] . CPPs have proven to be very efficient in delivering molecules into cells that are refractory to transfection such as primary lymphocytes [45] . In 1999, Schwarze et a l. successfully delivered into all tissues in mice the 120-kDa tat-conjugated β-galactosidase protein, which retained its enzymatic activity [46] . Impressively, the conjugate had also crossed the blood-brain barrier and reached the brain tissues, which is usually restricted to small and highly lipophilic peptides. CPPs offer the opportunity to deliver therapeutic molecules that are 200 times larger than the current bioavailability size restriction [45] . CPP-mediated delivery of bioactive compounds into model organisms for cancer [47] , cardiomyopathy [48] , stroke [49] , muscular dystrophy [50] and viral infections, support the strong therapeutic potential exerted by CPPs. Clinical trials are taking CPP-based drugs a step closer to therapeutic applications. An heptamer arginineconjugated cyclosporine A (Psorban) has entered phase II of a clinical trial for topical treatment of psoriasis [29, 51] . The oligoarginine peptide allows the penetration of cyclosporine A into cells throughout the otherwise impermeable epidermis and dermis. This review will focus on studies that explored the use of CPPs to deliver antisense agents into virusinfected cells and animal models (Table 1) . 

The past decade has witnessed the breakthrough of gene-silencing antisense agents including antisense oligonucleotides (AOS), AOS analogues, ribozymes, DNAzymes and the popular siRNAs. This novel approach is based on the discovery 30 years ago that nucleic acid molecules could be used to specifically target complementary viral nucleic acid sequences and inhibit viral replication [52, 53] . With these new promising molecules comes the ability to simultaneously target multiple viral sequences, which would preclude the selection of drug resistance. Mechanisms of antiviral activity exerted by CPP conjugates. These antiviral agents can target retroviruses, as shown for HIV, non-retroviral RNA viruses, as shown for the negative-sense RNA EBOV and HCV, and DNA viruses, as shown for HSV. Interference with viral RNA processing and translation further inhibits viral replication. CPP conjugates can also be designed to target virus-infected cells. CPP can also inactivate the virion and render cells resistant to infection, inhibiting cell infection. proCasp3 stands for pro-caspase 3; RT stands for reverse transcription; Tn stands for transportan.

So far, conjugation of CPPs to phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) has clearly been the most popular and most promising use of CPPs in antiviral development. PMOs are antisense DNA oligonucleotide analogues [54] . Their backbone is composed of morpholine rings joined by uncharged phosphodiamidate linkages, in place of the sugar and anionic phosphodiester linkage of DNA. They are typically synthesized as 20-25-base long oligomers. They offer great features for clinical applications: they are water-soluble, nuclease-resistant, and their uncharged backbone interacts weakly with serum and cellular proteins thereby reducing toxicity [55] . PMOs are mainly designed to interact with 5' and 3' non-coding regions of the target mRNA, AUG-codon translation start-site region or splice junctions. They As PMOs do not efficiently enter cells on their own, investigators have been routinely arming them with CPPs to promote their uptake into virus-infected cells and enhance their antisense efficacy [56, 57] . These peptide-conjugated PMOs are referred to as PPMOs in the literature. As highlighted by Moulton and Jiang [58] , PMOs are particularly well-suited cargoes for CPPs as their uncharged components do not interact with the positively-charged carrier peptide thereby not interfering with its membrane binding properties. The first report of PPMO antiviral activity in 2004 [59] has fueled the increasing interest in PMO-technology to inhibit viral infections as witnessed by more than 20 in vit ro and/or in vi vo studies published on antiviral PPMOs within the last five years (Table 1 ). Studies on RNA viruses have been extensively reviewed by Stein [60] with the latest in vivo work discussed by Moulton and Jiang [58] . We will focus here on the overall findings in regards to the cell penetrating moiety of the conjugates, and we will then review the studies on targeting DNA viruses.

Peptide-mediated PMO delivery has been the focus of intense efforts to identify active, stable, non toxic and endosomolytic CPPs, of which (RXR) 4 XB (also called P7; R = L-arginine, X = 6-aminohexanoic acid; B = β-alanine) has proven very successful [61, 62] . In antiviral studies, PMOs have been covalently linked to various arginine-rich peptides, the most frequent being R 9 F 2 C (R = L-arginine; F = L-phenylalanine; C = L-cysteine), R 5 F 2 R 4 C (also called P4), and (RXR) 4 XB. Conjugation is mainly at the 5'-terminal end of the PMO. In studies comparing the activity of various CPPs against murine hepatitis virus (MHV) [63] and Ebola virus (EBOV) [64] , arginine-rich peptides with insertions of 6-aminohexanoic acid stood out for their in vi vo effectiveness. The higher the number of arginine-6aminohexanoic repeats, the higher were PMO antiviral effect on MHV in cell culture [63] and the protection against EBOV infection in mice [64] . These findings agree with the results from Amantana et a l. [57] , Abes et al. [61] and Youngblood et al. [65] , who also found that these residues increased serum stability and enhanced endosomal escape of the conjugates. Burrer et al. documented that the nature of the linker (XB or cysteine) did not affect PPMO in v itro effectiveness against MHV or cytotoxicity, although the insertion of β-alanine residues was reported to improve both serum and intracellular stability of PPMO conjugates [65] .

PPMO antiviral activity has mainly been exploited against a wide range of non-retroviral RNA viruses. In cell culture, PPMOs were tested against West Nile virus (WNV) [66, 67] , Japanese encephalitis virus [67] , St. Louis encephalitis virus [67] , dengue virus (DENV) [68] [69] [70] , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [71] , MHV [59, 63] , equine arteritis virus [72] , porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [73] , foot-and-mouth disease virus [74] , poliovirus 1 (PV1) [75] , human rhinovirus 14 [75] , coxsackievirus B2 [75] , coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) [76] , Sindbis virus [77] , Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) [77] , EBOV [64, 78] , respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [79] , measles virus [80] , and influenza A virus (FLUAV) [81, 82] .

Cell culture assays consistently showed that PPMO readily entered infected cells and could specifically and strongly inhibit viral replication. Fluorescein-labeled PPMOs accumulated in the nucleus but were present throughout the cells [66, 79] . Lai et al. [79] reported punctuate foci of signal in the cell cytoplasm which might be indicative of endosomal entrapment of PPMO.

Many investigators identified potent PPMO activity in cell culture assays and went on to test their antiviral properties in murine experimental models. Most of the investigators explored both the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of PPMO and the best protection was usually achieved with pre-infection and post-infection PPMO treatments. PPMOs were shown to suppress viral replication, attenuate symptoms of disease in and/or increase survivorship of mice infected with WNV [67] , DENV [70] , MHV [63] , PV1 [75] , CVB3 [76] , VEEV [77] , EBOV [64, 78] , RSV [79] , and FLUAV [82, 83] . Some PPMOs demonstrated very profound and impressive antiviral effects. In particular, two 5-μg pre-infection doses of (RX 8 )B-conjugated PMOs completely protected mice against lethal challenge with EBOV [64, 78] . Mice treated with 200-μg doses of a (RXR) 4 XB-conjugated PPMO given pre-and postinfection survived VEEV lethal infection [77] . The authors found that over the 28-day period of monitoring, VEEV was undetectable in PPMO-treated mice brain, blood and peripheral tissues.

While PPMOs are being routinely tested against RNA viruses, there have only been a handful of studies documenting the use of PPMO technology against DNA viruses. The first report came from Zhang et a l. who were interested in blocking Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) lytic replication [84] . They explored the effects of the inhibition of the expression of KSHV latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) and replication and transcription activator (RTA), two factors involved in latency maintenance and in the switch to lytic phase, respectively. To do so, the investigators designed PMOs directed against LANA and RTA and covalently conjugated them at their 5' terminal to R 5 F 2 R 4 C peptide. While fluorescein (Fl)-labeled PMOs entered cells poorly, Fl-PPMOs were efficiently taken up by BCBL-1 lymphocytes which, as emphasized by the authors, are difficult to efficiently transfect with common techniques such as lipofectamine. PPMOs could effectively inhibit RTA and LANA protein expression in cell culture. Treatment of KSHV-infected cells with RTA PPMO suppressed KSHV lytic replication. RTA knock down resulted in reduced levels of proteins expressed downstream of RTA. One of these downstream proteins is viral interleukin-6 (vIL-6) and is thought to be essential for the development of KSVH-associated diseases. In a subsequent study, Zhang et al. blocked the expression of vIL-6 with PPMOs. vIL-6 PMOs were covalently conjugated at their 5' to (RXR) 4 XB or R 5 F 2 R 4 C. PPMO treatment inhibited vIL-6 expression, which in turn reduced human IL-6 level and KSHV yield, and reduced growth of treated cells [85] .

Moerdyk-Schauwecker et al. tackled the reactivation of another DNA virus, the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) [86] . They investigated the antiviral activities of five (RXR) 4 XB-conjugated PMOs directed against three HSV-1 immediate-early genes, ICP0, ICP4 and ICP27 crucial for HSV-1 replication. The most potent PPMOs designed against ICP0 or ICP27 strongly inhibited HSV-1 replication in cell culture by reducing viral protein expression (Figure 1 ). In particular, ICP0 PPMO was able to suppress the replication of several HSV-1 strains, including an acyclovir-resistant strain. The authors also tested ICP0 PPMO in a mouse model of ocular herpes infection. Topical application of 10 μg ICP0 PPMO to the eyes of HSV-1 infected mice inhibited virus replication in mouse eyes and reduced the incidence of eye disease by 37.5-50%, thereby preventing death associated with HSV-1 eye infection. To evaluate in vivo PPMO toxicity, the investigators applied 100 μg ICP0 PPMO (ten times the antiviral dose) daily to the eyes of uninfected mice. No gross or microscopic eye damage, no effect on body weight and temperature and no change of behavior were observed following the seven-day treatment. These results strengthen the potential of PPMOs as a treatment for recurring corneal disease from HSV-1 reactivation.

Besides improving PMO cellular uptake, the CPP moiety was also shown to intensify PMO antisense activity against EBOV by 10-to 100-fold in cell-free translation assays [64] . These results are consistent with the findings of Nelson et a l. who showed that PPMOs exhibited antisense activity 3-to 25-fold higher than corresponding PMOs while bearing lower off-target effects [87] . The authors propose that the arginine-rich peptides enhance RNA-PMO binding affinity thereby increasing specific antisense activity.

PPMOs appear to be generally well tolerated by cultured cells and animal recipients. However, some studies reported toxicity in cell culture with increase of PPMO dose [66] or longer period of exposure [66, 75] , and in vivo toxicity as the treatment dose increased, usually at doses higher than antiviral ones [67] . The peptide moiety of PPMOs seems to contribute to this toxicity. When Deas et al. tested both PMO and PPMO against WNV in mice, they found that mice could tolerate higher doses of PMO compared to PPMO (3 mg against 300 μg, respectively) [67] . Mice treated with high doses of PPMO would suffer from weight loss and develop abnormal behavior and smaller livers. Besides dosedependent toxicity, the schedule of treatment regimen may also affect PPMO toxicity: while Burrer et al. did not document any treatment-associated toxicity when PPMOs were administered to healthy mice, they observed significant toxicity when PPMO treatment was given after MHV challenge [63] . Lupfer et a l. reported abnormal infiltration of mouse lungs by immune system cells when PPMO targeting FLUAV was administered at higher doses [83] . The authors hypothesized that the arginine-rich CPP mimics the eosinophil major basic protein, also rich in arginine residues, in triggering the migration of inflammatory cells.

There have been a few reports of PMO-mediated antiviral activity in animal models. How PMOs could successfully suppress viral replication in vivo without the help of CPPS is not understood. Warfield et al. reported the nearly complete protection of rhesus macaques against EBOV lethal infection using PMOs [88] .

PMOs were also reported to increase the survival of calicivirus-infected cats [89] . Studies have been done that directly compared PMO and PPMO antiviral activity in vivo. One study found that both PPMO-and PMO-treated mice survived EBOV lethal challenge (100% and 85% respectively, the difference being not statistically significant) [78] . However, other comparative reports clearly document that PPMO are far more effective than PMOs in mice. PPMOs offered 100% protection against EBOV infection at 5-μg and 50-μg doses while PMOs gave only 15% protection at 50-μg doses [64] . PPMOs increased survival of DENV-infected mice up to eight days whereas PMOs did not provide any survival benefit [70] . PMOs could not protect mice against WNV infection while PPMOs, even at doses 10-fold lower, delayed clinical signs and increased WNV-infected mice survival by 60% [67] . The differential activities observed in EBOV studies may be explained by the fact that Swenson et a l. used the (RXR) 4 XB peptide while Enterlein et al. linked their PMO to the R 9 F 2 C peptide.

Peptide-nucleic acids or PNAs are oligonucleotide analogues in which the sugar-phosphate backbone has been replaced with peptide bonds [90] . They are resistant to both nucleases and proteases. They are used as antisense molecules to specifically bind to their complementary DNA or RNA sequences, creating a structural hindrance and inhibiting viral transcription, translation and replication processes.

Reports of anti-HIV-1 PNA delivery via CPPs come from Pandey's [91] [92] [93] [94] and Gait's [95] groups which have been working on antivirals targeting highly-conserved regulatory regions of the HIV-1 genome critical for its replication and gene expression, such as the primer-binding site, the A-loop and the transactivation response element (TAR). In their studies, the authors designed PNAs directed against these regions to inhibit HIV-1 gene expression and replication (Figure 1 ).

The poor cellular uptake of these uncharged compounds led Pandey and co-workers to covalently conjugate PNA at its 5' end to various cell-penetrating peptides, including transportan, tat and penetratin, via disulfide bridges [91] [92] [93] [94] . Upon coupling to these carrier peptides, the PNA cargoes were rapidly taken up by different human cell types in culture. When added to culture medium, these anti-HIV-1 PNA-CPP conjugates effectively inhibited HIV-1 replication, tat-dependent trans-activation and viral production by infected cells; no significant decrease was observed with the unconjugated PNA, emphasizing the great promise held by these conjugates as antiviral agents [91] .

Turner et al. also chose to enhance the cellular delivery and biological activity of PNA by covalently attaching them to CPPs [95] . They raised the more technical but nonetheless very important question of how the type of CPP and the way it is linked to the PNA affects the ability of the PNA to reach its cellular target. They conjugated the PNA to the CPP either via a stable polyether linker or through a cleavable disulfide bond and tested a range of CPPs. They could inhibit tat-dependent trans-activation in HeLa cells with disulfide-linked conjugates of PNA to transportan or to the chimeric peptide R 6 -penetratin (R = L-arginine). However, unlike what was reported by Tripathi et a l. [93] , they found that tat and penetratin conjugates failed to inhibit transcription. None of the conjugates carrying the stable polyether linker could elicit trans-activation inhibition. Interestingly, supplementation of cell medium with the lysosomotropic reagent chloroquine enhanced inhibitory activity of disulfide-linked conjugates and stablylinked conjugates gained some inhibitory activity. Supported by confocal microscopy data on cell localization of conjugates, the authors argued that endosomal release is a limiting factor in conjugates efficiency: following cell uptake, CPP-PNA conjugates would be entrapped in endosomal or other membrane-bound cytosolic compartments and some of them would then be slowly released. Endosomal entrapment was also reported with PPMO conjugates [79] . However, this observation differs from Chaubey et al. conclusion of the conjugates not being taken up by the endocytic pathway as uptake was not affected by low temperature or phenylarsine oxide [92] . Turner et al. attempted to improve not only the cell delivery but also the endosomal release properties of CPPs to increase PNA antiviral activity [95] .

As no effective therapy is currently available for treatment of JEV infection, Yoo et al. investigated the antiviral activity exerted by various PNAs directed against JEV RNA cis-acting elements [96] . All PNAs were conjugated to tat via an O-linker to promote efficient cellular uptake. Tat-PNAs successfully inhibited JEV proliferation in cell culture. JEV replication is thought to take place in specialized structures derived from host membranes harboring the viral RNA polymerase and host proteins involved in viral RNA replication [97] . This would mean that not only tat-PNA conjugates crossed the plasma membrane but they were also able to penetrate into the convoluted membrane system to interfere with viral replication.

To date, only few in vi vo studies have been reported with CPP-PNA conjugates [98] . In the field of antivirals, Pandey and colleagues have started preliminary toxicity, immunological and pharmacokinetic studies in mice for the anti-HIV-1 PNA TAR -penetratin conjugate [99] [100] [101] . Chaubey et a l. reported the non-toxicity of the complex when administered at repeat doses ranging up to 100 mg/kg [99] . Mice which were given 100 mg/kg of the conjugate, a dose the authors highlight is far in excess of the expected therapeutic dose, suffered from diarrhea and reduced physical activity and from spleen, liver and kidney serotosis. However they recovered during the 60-day follow-up period with no irreversible organ damage reported.

Upadhyay et a l. demonstrated that PNA TAR -penetratin conjugate is moderately immunogenic mainly due to its penetratin moiety [100] . Cytokine secretion profiles of the lymph node cells showed elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-2 and IL-12, which are known to promote proliferation of T lymphocytes and slow down the death of CD4+ T cells. The authors emphasize that these immunogenic properties of the conjugate could prove to be beneficial to the host.

Ganguly et a l. studied the tissue distribution and clearance of 125 I-labeled PNA TAR and its penetratin and tat conjugates [101] . They reported the distribution of the conjugates throughout the mouse major internal organs when administered by oral route as well as their slow release and clearance from different organs. Surprisingly, unconjugated naked PNA TAR displayed a similar tissue distribution and clearance profile although the extent of its uptake was lower than its CPP conjugate. In vi vo antiviral activity of PNA TAR and its penetratin and tat conjugates needs to be assessed.

The use of CPPs to deliver siRNAs into cells has rather been limited to date, even more so for antiviral siRNAs. Järver et al. suggested that siRNAs could be less amenable to CPP delivery due to charge interactions between the peptide and the siRNA and inefficient endosomal escape of the conjugates [30] . To our knowledge, the only report of CPP-mediated delivery of antiviral siRNA is from Meng et al. who constructed a cell-permeable siRNA targeting hepatitis C virus 5' untranslated region [102] . The siRNA was crosslinked at its 3' end with the tat peptide. The authors reported the cellular uptake and antiviral effect of the CPP-siRNA as being as efficient as transfection with lipofectamine in Huh-7 cell culture. However, some cell types being refractory to lipofectamine transfection which can moreover be toxic in vivo, CPP-mediated delivery of siRNA is definitely worth investigating in other cell types and in animal models of viral infections.

Although Kumar et al. did not use CPP as a cell delivery system per se , it is noteworthy that they exploited its binding capability to polyanionic nucleic acids such as siRNAs [15] . The authors developed a novel method for systemic delivery of antiviral siRNAs into T cells in mice: they used an antibody to the CD7 receptor as their delivery system by receptor-mediated endocytosis. They bound the siRNA to the antibody through the positively charged nona-D-arginine (9R) peptide conjugated to its C-terminal via a disulfide bond. They successfully suppressed HIV-1 infection in a humanized mouse model using a cocktail of these siRNA complexes, inhibiting HIV-1 entry into target cells and its replication.

The following studies have harnessed the carrier capability of the tat and 9R peptides to shuttle potential antiviral proteins into virus-infected cells. To our knowledge, the first report of the successful use of CPP to deliver potential antiviral agents into cells is by Vocero-Akbani et al. in 1999 [103] . In their elegant study, the authors took a novel approach to specifically kill HIV-infected cells thereby preventing the production of infectious virions. They engineered a zymogen form of the apoptosis-promoting enzyme caspase 3 that, upon entry into HIV-infected cells, would be processed into its active form by the HIV protease ( Figure 1 ). To deliver this modified caspase-3 into Jurkat T cells, they armed the recombinant protein with the tat peptide at its N-terminal. The authors showed that they could transduce about 100% of cells in less than 20 min. Confocal analysis localized FITC-labeled TAT-caspase-3 to both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. While TAT-caspase-3 remained inactive in uninfected cells, its uptake resulted in massive apoptosis in HIV-infected Jurkat T cells. Although a very promising study, no further or follow-up investigations have been reported.

Due to its ability to interact with cellular and viral proteins, p27SJ, a protein from the St John's wort, has been put forward as a potential anti-HIV-1 molecule by Darbinian et a l. [104] . Recently, the investigators have used the tat peptide as part of a bi-directional protein transduction system where the antiviral protein of interest, p27SJ, was expressed with tat at its C-terminal. Secreted into the cell medium, the fusion protein efficiently entered HIV-infected cells through a tat-mediated uptake and strongly inhibited HIV-1 transcription and replication (Figure 1) .

The tat peptide was also conjugated to peptide ligands impairing interactions between the HIV-1 regulatory protein Rev and host cellular factors [105] . Following their tat-mediated cellular uptake into primary lymphocytes and macrophages, these inhibitory heptapeptides, expressed in fusion with stabilizing proteins, successfully suppressed HIV-1 replication, although at a concentration higher than those of currently used antiviral drugs. Along with a better design of the peptide ligand, conjugation to other CPPs may improve cellular uptake and therefore antiviral activity.

In addition to targeting HIV-1, CPP-mediated protein delivery was further exploited to inhibit human papillomavirus type 18 (HPV-18) in cell culture [106] . Mino et al. delivered artificial zinc-finger proteins (AZPs) into cultured cells by expressing AZPs in fusion with the 9R peptide. These AZP-9R conjugates strongly inhibited HPV-18 replication to 3% at 250 nM while gene-delivered AZP only achieved 12% inhibition. PTD4 conjugates were also tested but proved to be less effective than AZPs fused to 9R.

While studying the delivery of anti-HSV-1 antivirals using a peptide derived from FGF4 signal peptide, Bultmann et al. found that the peptide itself exerted antiviral activity [107] . This discovery led them to investigate the intrinsic antiviral properties of a range of peptides against HSV-1 infection in cultured cells. Tested peptides included EB (stands for entry blocker; it is a modified FGF4 signal peptide), tat, KLA (a synthetic amphipatic peptide), and HOM (derived from Drosophila antennapedia protein), and their modified peptides [107] [108] [109] . In particular, a tat peptide containing a cysteine residue at its C-terminal (tat-C) was shown to be able to inhibit infection in three ways: irreversibly inactivating virions exposed to tat-C prior to cell infection, blocking entry of cell-adsorbed viruses, and inducing a state of resistance to infection in cells pretreated with tat-C ( Figure 1 ) [109] . Mechanisms of antiviral activities have not been determined yet but tat-C seems to act by inhibiting viral entry at the fusion step rather than at the virus attachment step. Virion inactivation may result from tat-C binding to sialic acids on the viral envelop glycoproteins.

Along with the antiviral property of their anti-HIV-1 PNA-CPP complexes, Chaubey et a l. and Tripathi et a l. investigated the virucidal effect of their conjugates and their potential use as microbicide [92, 94] . They showed that pre-incubation of HIV-1 virions with these molecules rendered them noninfectious and blocked further cell infection. Two hypotheses may explain these results (Figure 1 ). The conjugates may have been able to enter the virion particles and bind to the TAR region of the viral RNA. The PNA-CPP may also have altered or disrupted the viral envelope through the interaction of the CPP moiety with the viral lipid bilayer, thereby inhibiting host cell infection. The authors showed that brief exposure of virions to CPP-PNA conjugates blocked endogenous reverse transcription within virion particles, arguing in favor of a virucidal effect due to the PNA moiety interaction with the viral RNA. However, their work set the stage for exploring anti-HIV-1 activity displayed by CPPs on their own. CPPs share structural similarities and membrane-binding properties with another class of peptides: the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) [31] . AMPs are small peptides carrying basic and hydrophobic residues. They are found in all living organisms. Mainly produced by leukocytes and epithelial cells, they are major players in the innate immune response against infectious agents. Interestingly, AMPs have been put forward as one potential class of novel antivirals. Their antimicrobial activity has been reported against both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, blocking viral infection in different ways [110] : they can directly inactivate the virion through disruption of its envelop or interaction with its glycoproteins; they can act on infected cells possibly through interactions with cell receptors resulting in alterations in cellsignaling pathways required for virus replication; they can block the fusion of the viral membrane with the endosome of the host cell, thereby interfering with viral replication; finally, they can interact with and inhibit viral enzymes essential to the virus replication [111] . In view of the similarities between CPPs and AMPs and of the reports of anti-HSV-1 effects of some peptides, CPP's potential intrinsic antiviral activity undoubtedly deserves further investigation.

The above reviewed studies contain a common message: CPP-conjugated antiviral agents hold great promise as novel preventive and therapeutic modalities against viral infections. The remarkable antiviral effects of PPMOs against lethal infections with EBOV, VEEV, FLUAV and DENV, and against the usually-lethal infections with PV1 and WNV, call for a wider use of CPPs in the delivery of antiviral drugs. CPP-conjugated antivirals also show promise in inhibiting the reactivation from latent infections of viruses such as HSV-1. Moreover, the assessment of CPP antiviral properties and the understanding of their molecular mechanisms could lead to the exploitation of these activities for the development of microbicides to inactivate virions after exposure.

These CPP-antiviral studies illustrate the search for the "perfect" CPP-cargo couple, as CPP carrier efficiency is dependent on the nature of its cargo, affecting the antiviral activity. This is particularly true for PPMO research where much effort has been put towards developing highly active peptides to outperform the more traditionally used penetratin and tat peptides [61, 62] . Improving CPP endosomolytical properties to intensify antiviral activity of the conjugated cargo has become a main focus, as the endosomal escape appears to be critical to antiviral activity [30] .

CPP should not only promote the cellular uptake of the cargo but also improve its intracellular trafficking to ensure that it reaches the appropriate cellular compartment. This aspect cannot be overlooked when designing antivirals as different viruses may carry their replication cycles in different subcellular locations such as the cytosol, the nucleus or in an intricate membrane system within the cytosol. The type of linkage between the CPP and the antiviral compound is of importance as for instance a disulphide bond would result in the rapid release of the cargo through the action of cytoplasm glutathione. Therefore the choice of CPP should not only be optimized to the cargo but should also be specific to the virus to ensure that the antiviral molecule efficiently reaches its viral target in the subcellular compartment.

Research on antiviral CPP-PNA, -siRNA and -protein conjugates, although encouraging, is still at its infancy and importantly needs validation in animal models. There is a need for improvement in the design of CPP to tackle the issue of in vi vo toxicity and thereby make the drug conjugates safer. As Stein highlights, even though PPMO dose regimens are shown to be nontoxic, it will be necessary to show that treatment with doses several times higher than the expected therapeutic dose is well tolerated [60] . It is noteworthy that all the PPMO studies were done in collaboration with a company specializing in RNAbased drugs, AVI BioPharma Inc, which first developed the PMO and provided the PPMO compounds. Of all the CPP-antiviral investigations, PPMO studies are the ones that are at the most advanced stage, with several reports of use in animal models and directed against a wide range of viruses. The work on PPMO illustrates the successful collaboration between academia and industry.

One recurring challenge in the global control of viral infections is the development of drug-resistant viral strains. It is very likely that escape mutants will arise during treatment, especially if long-term therapy is required. This issue can be overcome if treatment can be easily switched to different antisense molecules. The ease to synthesize a new CPP-PNA, CPP-siRNA or PPMO directed to the mutated sequence needs to be addressed. According to Stein, PPMO production is costly and complex [60] . Most investigators limited their in vi vo studies to the most potent PPMO identified in cell culture. However, treatment with a combination of antisense molecules targeting multiple sequences in the viral genome should have a greater antiviral effect compared to a treatment with a single antisense molecule, and should prevent selection of escape variants. More studies with treatment with a cocktail of antivirals would be of critical relevance for further clinical applications.

A number of CPPs are derived from viral proteins, such tat, VP22, and FHV. The role of these cell penetrating motifs during infection has yet to be elucidated but it is interesting to see that another obligate intracellular pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, also possesses a cell wall protein with such a peptide sequence [25] . CPPs represent an example of how understanding how pathogens interact with human host cells can lead to new ways to treat and prevent viral infections.

Comparative Analysis of Lycorine in Wild Plant and Callus Culture Samples of Hymenocallis littoralis by HPLC-UV Method

The Hymenocallis littoralis, an ornamental and medicinal plant, had been traditionally used for wound healing. In the present study, an analytical method using HPLC with ultraviolet detection was developed for the quantification of lycorine in the extracts of different parts of wild plant and tissue culture samples of H. littoralis. The separation was achieved using a reversed-phase column. The method was found to be accurate, repeatable, and sensitive for the quantification of minute amount of lycorine present in the samples. The highest lycorine content was found in the bulb extract (2.54 ± 0.02 g/mg) whereas the least was in the root extract (0.71 ± 0.02 g/mg) of the wild plants. Few callus culture samples had high content of lycorine, comparable to that of wild plants. The results showed that plant growth regulators, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) alone at 4.5 M (2.58 ± 0.38 g/mg) or a combination of 2,4-D at 9.00 M with 4.5 M of 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), were the optimum concentrations for the production of high lycorine (2.45 ± 0.15 g/mg) content in callus culture. The present analytical method could be of value for routine quantification of lycorine in the tissue culture production and standardization of the raw material or extracts of H. littoralis.

Hymenocallis littoralis (Amaryllidaceae), known locally as "Melong kecil, " is an ornamental and bulbous perennial herb. It has been traditionally used in Philippines as a vulnerary [1] . Plants in the Amaryllidaceae family were reported to contain alkaloids that are known to exhibit a wide range of pharmacological activities [2] . A number of alkaloids were isolated from the Hymenocallis littoralis such as lycorine, littoraline, hippeastrine, lycorenine, tazettine, pretazettine, macronine, homolycorine, lycoramine, vittatine, and haemanthamine [3] . These compounds were reported to possess various pharmacological effects such as antiviral, antiparasitic, anticancer, antibacterial, antioxidant, and wound healing [4] [5] [6] .

Lycorine, a pyrrolophenanthridine alkaloid, is one the major alkaloids found in H. littoralis [2, 7] . It displays strong antiviral effect against poliovirus, measles, and herpes simplex type 1 viruses [8] . Besides, lycorine also possesses potent antiretroviral [9] , antimitotic [10, 11] , and cytotoxic activities [2, 12] .

Different analytical techniques have been described for the qualitative and quantitative determination of alkaloids in both wild plant and in vitro culture of Amaryllidaceae including GC-MS [2, 11, 12] , spectrophotometric [2] , HPTLC [11, 13] , and enzyme immunoassay [2] . Few HPLC methods coupled with various detection methods were described for determination of lycorine in Amaryllidaceae plants such as Galanthus species [7] , Leucojum aestivum, and Pancratium 2

The Scientific World Journal maritimum [2] and Sternbergia species [14] as well as tissue culture of Pancratium maritimum [15] , Narcissus confusus [10] , and Leucojum aestivum [16] .

In vitro propagation is an important tool for rapid multiplication of medicinal plants [17, 18] as well as for the production of secondary metabolites. Tissue culture will ensure that the sources of the medicinal plants will not be exhausted or overexploited for their secondary metabolites. This is because the number of wild plants will not be effected due to overharvesting of the respective plants. Moreover the medicinal properties of a plant can be retained or increased via in vitro techniques. Previously, Yew et al. [18] have reported the effect of different cytokinins on in vitro shoot length and multiplication of H. littoralis. By adjusting phytohormones concentrations in the medium, differences in amount, rate, and growth patterns of explants were observed [19, 20] .

Despite many publications on the pharmacological effects of its chemical constituents, there is very little information available on the phytochemical analysis of H. littoralis wild plants or callus culture. Likewise, there is no report on the capability of callus culture of H. littoralis to produce secondary metabolites such as lycorine which has important pharmacological effects. The establishment and quantification of lycorine via in vitro propagation technique could be a first step in mass production of any desired secondary metabolites in pharmaceutical industries. Thus, in the present study, a simple HPLC with UV detection method was developed for phytochemical analysis of different parts of H. littoralis wild plants. The method was further extended for the quantification of lycorine in callus culture obtained from various combinations of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 6-benzylaminopurine concentrations.

The standard lycorine was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Analytical grade methanol used for the extraction and HPLC grade acetonitrile and methanol used for analysis were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). 2,4-D and BAP were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, USA).

Conditions. The HPLC analysis was carried out using Gilson HPLC System (USA) comprising of solvent delivery pump and ultraviolet (UV) detector connected to a Hitachi D-2500 Chromato-integrator (Tokyo, Japan) for data collection. An Eclipse Plus reversed-phase C-18 column (250 × 4.6 i.d. mm, 5 m particle size; Agilent, USA) was used for separation. The mobile phase used was acetonitrile-1% aqueous ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.0 (15 : 85 v/v) at the flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The sample injection volume was 20 L and the wavelength of the detector was set at 325 nm.

The stock solution of lycorine was prepared by dissolving accurately weighed standard in methanol to give the concentration of 100 g/mL.

The stock solution was then diluted with methanol in twofold (50 g/mL) dilutions to obtain a series of working standard solutions. All working standard solutions were stored in freezer at −20 ∘ C prior to analysis.

For the ex vitro H. littoralis, plants were bought from a nearby nursery in Jalan Masjid Negeri, Pulau Pinang. The plant materials were washed thoroughly and separated into different parts, namely, root, bulb, stem, leaves, flower, and anther.

For the in vitro plant, callus culture samples were obtained via tissue culture method. To initiate callus culture, the meristematic tissues of the bulb were cultured in semisolid Murashige and Skoog [21] media. Various concentrations of 2,4-D alone (2.25, 4.50, 9.00, 13.50, 18.00, and 22.50 M) and also with combination of 4.50 M BAP and 2.25, 4.50, 9.00, 13.50, 18.00, and 22.50 M of 2,4-D were used for the initiation of callus. For each concentration, four explants were cultured on the semisolid MS medium in a single culture jar (59 mm × 66 mm). It was then repeated three times which made up to a total of 16 replicates (4 explants × 4 jars). Finally, the cultures were kept in culture room under dark condition at 25 ± 2 ∘ C. Developed callus was collected after four weeks and dried in the oven at 50 ∘ C.

As for the ex vitro plant, the plant parts were dried in oven at 50 ∘ C until a constant weight was achieved and then were ground. The powdered plants were then extracted by sonication for 10 min at room temperature of 25 ± 2 ∘ C using methanol as the solvent (plant materials-solvent ratio of 1 : 5 to 1 : 10). After filtration, the filtrates were dried using a rotary evaporator (Buchi, Switzerland) at 40 ∘ C to obtain the respective extracts. The extracts were then kept in freezer at −20 ∘ C prior to analysis. Meanwhile, for in vitro plants, dried callus was then powdered using a mortar and pestle and extracted by sonication method as described above.

and Linearity. For the LOD and LOQ determination, the working standard solutions at different concentrations were injected into HPLC from the highest to the lowest concentrations. The concentration with the smallest detectable peak, at a noise-to-signal ratio of 3, was taken as the limit of detection (LOD), whereas the lowest concentration with acceptable accuracy and precision at noise-to-signal ratio of 8 was taken as the limit of quantification (LOQ). The linearity of the calibration curve was evaluated by linear regression analysis.

Validation of the HPLC method was carried out to determine the withinday and between-day accuracies and precisions. The standard stock solution was prepared by dissolving 1 mg of lycorine in 10 mL of methanol to produce a concentration of 100 g/mL. Series of working solutions were prepared by diluting the stock solution with methanol to give concentrations of 0.20, The Scientific World Journal 3 0.78, 3.13, 12.50, and 50.00 g/mL. These working solutions were used to determine the within-day and between-day accuracies and precisions. The between-day analyses were carried out by injecting the standard working solutions once per day for five consecutive days while the withinday analyses were done by injecting the standard working solutions five times on the same day. A separate standard curve was constructed on each day of the validation study.

extracts analyses using HPLC-UV were carried out in two parts. The first part involved the quantification of the compound lycorine in methanolic extracts of different parts of H. littoralis, namely, root, bulb, stem, leaves, flower, and anther. The second part involved the quantification of the compound lycorine in callus extracts produced by using different combinations and concentrations of plant growth regulators (PGRs). Sample preparation for HPLC analysis was carried out by accurately weighing 2 mg of each dried extract, which was then dissolved in 2 mL of HPLC-grade methanol to give a concentration of 1 mg/mL. These samples were then filtered through a 0.45 m syringe filter (Whatman, Maidstone, England) and kept in fridge at −20 ∘ C prior to HPLC analysis.

All experiments were repeated thrice with three replicates for each extract. The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 20 software. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the means which were compared using the Tukey HSD at 5% level of significance ( < 0.05) were used.

To date, there is very little information available on the phytochemical analysis or standardization of H. littoralis extract, and to our best knowledge there is no HPLC method reported for the analysis of phytochemicals in H. littoralis. Therefore, an HPLC-UV method was developed and validated for quantification of lycorine in various H. littoralis extracts. Lycorine absorbed maximum UV wavelength at 325 nm, which was selected as detection wavelength. The wavelength selected differs from previous reports which ranged between 287 and 292 nm [2, 7, 14] . Lycorine was eluted in the present HPLC method within 5 min and the total run time was 10 min.

In search of optimal chromatographic conditions, different mobile phase compositions were investigated. The mobile phases were acetonitrile-deionised distilled water (ddH 2 O) at ratios of 40 : 60 v/v, 35 : 75 v/v, 30 : 70 v/v, 25 : 75 v/v, 20 : 80 v/v, and 15 : 85 v/v, each at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. All these mobile phases resulted in peak splitting and tailing. The retention time was longer than 5 min. This phenomenon may be due to the ionization of the compound in the column.

Taking this into consideration, acetic acid or formic acid was added into the mobile phase to suppress the ionization of the compounds. Different concentrations of acetic acid ranging from 0.25 to 1% and formic acid ranging from 0.25 to 0.5% were added into the mobile phase. In addition, the aqueous phase was replaced with 10 mM of phosphate buffer or 1% ammonium acetate buffer. It was found that 1% ammonium acetate buffer without any addition of acetic acid or formic acid was the optimum mobile phase for separation of lycorine. Therefore, the mobile phase chosen for the subsequent analysis was acetonitrile-1% ammonium acetate (15 : 85 v/v).

The HPLC chromatogram of marker compound, lycorine, is shown in Figure 1(a) . The calibration curve of lycorine obtained with the developed HPLC method was linear over the range of concentration from 0.20 to 50 g/mL with a mean slope of 1493, mean intercept value of 177.8, and correlation coefficient of greater than 0.999. The within-day and between-day precisions and accuracies for the analysis of lycorine are shown in Table 1 . The accuracy values, expressed as percentage of true value, were between 95.38% and 104.75%, while the corresponding precision values expressed as correlation of variation (CV) were between 0.73% and 8.15% for both within-day and between-day analysis, thus indicating that the present HPLC-UV method was reliable and repeatable.

The present HPLC-UV method had a lower LOQ compared to previous methods reported on analysis of lycorine, which were in the range of 1-34 g/mL [2, 7, 14] . The lower sensitivity of the present method permits the quantification of minute amount of lycorine present in the ex vivo plant tissues as well as the callus culture samples.

Tissue Culture Extracts. The developed method was used to quantify the amount of lycorine in extracts of various parts of the H. littoralis wild and tissue culture samples. Lycorine contents in those samples were calculated using external standard method and summarized in Table 2 while their representative chromatograms are shown in Figures 1(a)  and 1(b) . On the other hand, the contents of lycorine in extracts of callus samples are given in Table 3 while their representative chromatograms are shown in Figure 1 (c). The wild plant extract and callus (initiated from 4.5 M 2,4-D alone and 9.00 M 2,4-D with 4.5 M BAP combination) were statistically analyzed. There was significant production of lycorine in callus compared to wild type plant extract.

Generally, lycorine was detected in the extracts of all different parts of H. littoralis. As shown in Table 2 , the highest content of lycorine was found in the bulb. This finding is in agreement with that of Abou-Donia et al. [13] that the bulbs of Narcissus cv. Breath of Spring plants possess higher amount of lycorine. Nevertheless, flower and anther extract also contained high amount of lycorine of 2.43 and 2.13 g per mg of extract, respectively. Stem and leaves extracts of H. littoralis had lesser lycorine content compared to previous plant parts, while the least amount of lycorine was found in the root extract.

Analysis of extracts of callus culture of H. littoralis revealed some interesting findings. Callus cultures supplemented with growth regulators at various combinations Comparing the amount of lycorine obtained from both wild plant and the callus tissue culture, it can be noticed that callus culture supplemented with appropriate concentrations and combination of growth regulators resulted in production of comparable amount of lycorine. This may be due to the effect of plant growth regulators (PGRs) such as the auxin and cytokinin used herein. PGRs are known to have effects not only on cell differentiation and proliferation but also on the biosynthesis pathway of the cell [22, 23] . Therefore, in this study, there may be a probability that the 2,4-D and BAP used in the callus culture could have partly been involved in the biosynthesis of lycorine. From the present study, the callus culture may be supplemented with only 4.50 M 2,4-D or a combination of 9.00 M 2,4-D with 4.5 M BAP to obtain a good yield of lycorine. This study can be further extended to investigate other combinations of PGRs that may increase the lycorine content of the callus culture. The findings of such study would prove to be useful as there are many benefits of the lycorine to the medical and health sector.

An analytical method using HPLC with ultraviolet detection was developed for the quantification of lycorine in extracts of different parts of wild plant and tissue culture samples of H. littoralis. The method was found to be accurate and repeatable and sensitive for the quantification of minute amount of lycorine present in the samples. The highest lycorine content in the wild plants was found in the bulb extract, whereas the least was in the root extract. Callus culture samples of H. littoralis had comparable lycorine content to that of wild plants. The results showed that 4.5 M 2,4-D alone or a combination of 9.00 M with 4.5 M BAP was the optimum concentrations for the production of high lycorine content in callus culture.

Statistical analyses were conducted for the lycorine content in callus (initiated via 4.5 M 2,4-D alone, 9.00 M 2,4-D with combination of 4.5 M BAP) and H. littoralis wild plant part extracts. The investigation shows that lycorine production in initiated callus at 4.5 M 2,4-D alone and 9.00 M 2,4-D with 4.5 M BAP is not significantly different while there is significant difference when compared with wild plant extract ( > 0.05). This indicates that the callus formed from these 2 different plant growth regulators is having high amount of lycorine compared to wild type plant. Thus, for the upcoming study, this hormone combination could be a good start to initiate a callus from H. littoralis to obtain secondary metabolites. Hence, the present analytical method may be of value for routine quantification of lycorine in the callus culture production and standardization of the raw material or extracts of H. littoralis.

Unifying Viral Genetics and Human Transportation Data to Predict the Global Transmission Dynamics of Human Influenza H3N2

Information on global human movement patterns is central to spatial epidemiological models used to predict the behavior of influenza and other infectious diseases. Yet it remains difficult to test which modes of dispersal drive pathogen spread at various geographic scales using standard epidemiological data alone. Evolutionary analyses of pathogen genome sequences increasingly provide insights into the spatial dynamics of influenza viruses, but to date they have largely neglected the wealth of information on human mobility, mainly because no statistical framework exists within which viral gene sequences and empirical data on host movement can be combined. Here, we address this problem by applying a phylogeographic approach to elucidate the global spread of human influenza subtype H3N2 and assess its ability to predict the spatial spread of human influenza A viruses worldwide. Using a framework that estimates the migration history of human influenza while simultaneously testing and quantifying a range of potential predictive variables of spatial spread, we show that the global dynamics of influenza H3N2 are driven by air passenger flows, whereas at more local scales spread is also determined by processes that correlate with geographic distance. Our analyses further confirm a central role for mainland China and Southeast Asia in maintaining a source population for global influenza diversity. By comparing model output with the known pandemic expansion of H1N1 during 2009, we demonstrate that predictions of influenza spatial spread are most accurate when data on human mobility and viral evolution are integrated. In conclusion, the global dynamics of influenza viruses are best explained by combining human mobility data with the spatial information inherent in sampled viral genomes. The integrated approach introduced here offers great potential for epidemiological surveillance through phylogeographic reconstructions and for improving predictive models of disease control.

The emergence and worldwide dispersal of novel human pathogens is increasingly challenging global public health [1] .

Notable recent examples include novel influenza strains, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which all exploit today's complex and voluminous transport networks to rapidly disseminate in a globalized world. In the context of human infectious diseases, the worldwide air transportation network is by far the best studied system of global mobility [2] . Air travel likely drives the global circulation of seasonal influenza A (H3N2) viruses [3] , and may explain seasonal dynamics in the absence of locally-persistent strains between epidemic seasons. Retrospective modeling of the 'Hong Kong flu' H3N2 pandemic in 1968 indicates that the virus spread through a global network of cities interconnected by air travel [4] . Numerous modeling and simulation studies have subsequently explored the potential influence of air travel on influenza virus spread, e.g. [5] [6] [7] [8] , but few have attempted to verify such models against underlying empirical data on human movement patterns [9] .

Two studies on the timing and rate of seasonal influenza transmission across the United States of America (USA) highlight the difficulty of using standard epidemiological data to disentangle the relative contributions of different human transportation systems to influenza spread. Using weekly time series of excess mortality due to pneumonia and influenza (P&I), Viboud et al. [9] demonstrated that the patterns of timing and incidence of outbreaks across the continental USA are most strongly associated with rates of movement of people to and from their workplaces, and to a lesser extent with the distance between locations and various measures of domestic transportation. In contrast, Brownstein et al. [10] concluded that the rate of inter-regional spread and timing of influenza in the USA, as measured using weekly P&I mortality statistics, is predicted by domestic airline travel volume in November. These discordant findings generated significant debate [11] , especially in the context of a potential pandemic of pathogenic influenza [12] , which would require rapid decisions to be made on the implementation of travel restrictions.

As a historical record of epidemic spread, viral genetic sequence data may offer a valuable source of information for the empirical verification of epidemiological models. Several studies have demonstrated their utility and power, for example by revealing the genetic dynamics of influenza A H3N2 seasonality [13] and the spatial patterns of global H3N2 circulation [3, 14] . More generally, it is recognized that the genetic diversity of rapidly evolving viruses like influenza should be analysed in a framework that unifies evolutionary and ecological dynamics [15] . Current attempts to reconstruct viral spread through time and space from genetic data, however, typically fit parameter-rich models to sparse spatial data and result in phylogeographic patterns that are difficult to relate directly to underlying ecological processes [16] . Together with potential sampling bias, this complicates phylogeographic tasks, such as the characterization of source-sink dynamics in seasonal influenza. It is therefore unsurprising that different studies on the global circulation of H3N2 are sometimes inconsistent [3, 14, 17] , despite the importance of such work for influenza surveillance and vaccine strain selection.

Here we use a model-based approach to explicitly tests spatial epidemiological hypotheses by integrating empirical data on human movement patterns with viral genetic data. This framework enables us to measure the relative contribution of different predictive variables to viral spatial spread. We apply this approach to seasonal H3N2 dynamics and use it to identify key drivers of the global dissemination of influenza viruses. Analysis of different sampling schemes, including one that represents the community structure in global air transportation, provides consistent support for air travel governing the spatial dynamics of seasonal H3N2 infections. Using epidemiological simulations, we further demonstrate that estimates resulting from the merger of human air travel and H3N2 influenza genetics best capture the observed global expansion of pandemic H1N1 influenza in 2009.

We complemented a previously collected hemagglutinin sequence data set, comprising 1,441 sequences sampled globally from 2002 to 2007 [3] , with publicly available sequences sampled within the same time interval. The allocation of the sequence data into 15 and 26 geographic regions as well as into 14 air communities is described in detail in Supporting information Text S1.

The worldwide air transportation network is defined by a passenger flux matrix that quantifies the number of passengers traveling between each pair of airports. We use a dataset provided by OAG (Official Airline Guide) Ltd. (http://www.oag.com), containing 4,092 airports and the number of seats on scheduled commercial flights between pairs of airports during the years 2004-2006. We take the number of seats on scheduled commercial flights from airport i to j to be proportional to the number of passengers traveling.

To identify air transportation communities, we approximate a maximal-modularity subdivision of the 1,227-largest-airport network by employing a recently described stochastic Monte-Carlo approach [18] . Modularity provides a measure of how well the connectivity of a network is described by partitioning its nodes into non-overlapping groups; for a definition we refer to [19] . For any given partition, modularity will be high if connectivity within groups is high and connectivity among groups is low. For large networks, a variety of methods have been introduced to approximate their optimal subdivision. The method we employ here generates an ensemble of high modularity subdivisions and computes the consensus in this ensemble by superposition. For further details we refer to [18, 20] and in Text S1 we describe how we incorporate subdivision uncertainty in our phylogeographic approach.

We employ a novel approach to simultaneously reconstruct spatiotemporal history and test the contribution of potential predictors of spatial spread. The approach extends a recently developed Bayesian method of phylogeographic inference [21] into a generalized linear model (GLM), by parameterizing each rate of among-location movement in the phylogeographic model as a log linear function of various potential predictors. For each predictor j, the GLM parameterization includes a coefficient b j , which quantifies the contribution or effect size of the predictor (in log space), and a binary indicator variable d j , that allows the predictor to be included or excluded from the model. We estimate the d variables using a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) [22, 23] , resulting in an estimate of the posterior inclusion probability or support for each predictor. This approach uses the data to select the explanatory variables and their effect sizes from a pre-defined set of predictors that can explain the phylogenetic history of among-location movement while simultaneously

What explains the geographic dispersal of emerging pathogens? Reconstructions of evolutionary history from pathogen gene sequences offer qualitative descriptions of spatial spread, but current approaches are poorly equipped to formally test and quantify the contribution of different potential explanatory factors, such as human mobility and demography. Here, we use a novel phylogeographic method to evaluate multiple potential predictors of viral spread in human influenza dynamics. We identify air travel as the predominant driver of global influenza migration, whilst also revealing the contribution of other mobility processes at more local scales. We demonstrate the power of our inter-disciplinary approach by using it to predict the global pandemic expansion of H1N1 influenza in 2009. Our study highlights the importance of integrating evolutionary and ecological information when studying the dynamics of infectious disease.

reconstructing the ancestral locations in the evolutionary history. In Text S1, we (i) provide more mathematical detail of the GLM model, (ii) describe novel transition kernels for efficient statistical inference, (iii) propose prior specifications and (iv) explain how Bayes factors can be calculated for each predictor based on d estimates. The method introduced here is implemented in the BEAST software package [24] .

The GLM approach offers many statistical advantages over other approaches [25] in efficiently testing spatial hypotheses (see Text S1 for a detailed comparative analysis). Commonlyused Bayesian measures of model fit (such as marginal likelihood estimation using the harmonic mean), which can be applied to models with among-location movement rates fixed to a particular predictor, have been shown to perform poorly [26] [27] [28] . Although more accurate alternatives have recently been proposed [26] [27] [28] , they are computationally prohibitive on large data sets such as those studied here. Importantly, the previous approach provides only a relative ranking of different models and, unlike the GLM model, cannot identify which of the top-ranked predictors need to be jointly considered as explanatory variables. A further advantage of the GLM approach is that in addition to providing a measure of support for each predictor, it can also quantify the contribution or effect size of each predictor by estimating the associated coefficients (b).

For the spread of seasonal influenza, we consider several potential predictors of global migration, including different logtransformed measures of geographical distance, absolute latitude, air transportation data, demographic and economic data, viral surveillance data, antigenic evolution and sequence sample sizes (described in more detail in Text S1). Text S1 also reports the evolutionary and demographic models used in BEAST and describes how phylogenetic uncertainty is approximated during phylogeographic inference.

Phylogeographic movement events among locations are modeled by a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) process along each branch of the viral phylogeny. Although both the transitions among locations (Markov jumps) and the waiting times between transitions (Markov rewards) are not directly observed, posterior expectations of these values can be efficiently computed [29, 30] . Here, we implement posterior inference of the complete Markov jump history through time in BEAST and use these estimates to assess the source-sink dynamics of influenza and to evaluate the predictive performance of phylogeographic models.

To compare the performance of different migration rate models in predicting global pandemic spread, we simulate a stochastic meta-population susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model with n = 14 populations, matching the 14 air communities analyzed in the phylogeographic model. The model tracks the number of susceptible (S), infected (I) and recovered (R) individuals in each population each day of the simulation. The simulations begin with a single initial infection in Mexico on January 5th 2009 [31] . Infection spreads through mass-action within each population according to the following epidemiological parameters. Population-specific host population size is equal to human population size (Text S1). Basic epidemiological parameters are based on empirical estimates from H1N1: the duration of infection was chosen as 3 days [31] and the basic reproductive number (R 0 ) or average number of secondary infections arising from a primary infector during their infectious period in a completely susceptible population was chosen as 1.3 [31] . This results in a transmission rate b~0:433. Although estimates of R 0 for pandemic H1N1 vary across studies, the exact R 0 value is unlikely to affect the comparative simulations we perform as this is expected to equally impact the overall expansion rate and not the relative migration dynamics across populations. Force of infection l j within population j scales with infected frequency across populations following l j~P n i~1 r ij bI i S j =N j , where the coupling coefficient r ij represents the rate of contacts from population i to population j relative to within-population contacts and r jj~1 . Other pairwise coupling coefficients are taken to be proportional to pairwise migration estimates, so that r ij~c m ij , where m ij is the air travel based or phylogenetically estimated rate of migration from population i to population j per year and parameter c is fitted to the data. Parameter c is the only free parameter in this model and we set this to the value that maximizes correspondence between simulations and observations (see below). This ensures that we can use phylogeographic migration rates as per capita migration rates in the simulation model, despite their different scales. Compartments are updated according to a t-leaping algorithm [32] with one-day intervals.

Migration rates between populations in the SIR model are defined according to four scenarios, as follows: (A) equal rates, (B) rates proportional to the amount of air travel occurring between them (in terms of the number of passengers moving from one population to another), (C) rates proportional to Markov jump estimates based on a standard phylogeographic model (undertaken with and without BSSVS to reduce the number of rate parameters) and (D) a GLM model that only considers air travel as a predictor. To compare the spread of influenza under these simulated models to recorded H1N1 pandemic spread, we measure the relative correspondence between the mean peak times (across 100 simulations) and the observed peak times for all locations except Mexico (based on World Health Organization data; Text S1). Correspondence was measured using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, and tested with associated p-values obtained using a permutation test (Text S1), as well as using the mean average error (MAE; in days). We consider the Spearman's rank correlation coefficients to be more appropriate for our comparison because they are more robust to outliers, which are clearly present in the observed peaks. Therefore, the scaling of between-population coupling c for the various migration matrices was also adjusted so as to maximize Spearman's rank correlation.

To identify key factors in the seasonal dispersal of human influenza viruses, we use a Bayesian model selection procedure to estimate the phylogeographic history of H3N2 viruses sampled worldwide between 2002 and 2007 (Text S1), while concurrently evaluating the contribution of several potential predictors of spatial spread. In addition to considering two geographic discretizations of the available data, we also identify community structure in global air travel by determining partitions with high intracommunity connectivity and low inter-community connectivity (Methods). Although this approach is blind to the airports' geographic locations, the 14 resulting global air communities are spatially compact with few exceptions (Fig. 1) . We find air communities that are largely specific to Oceania, China, Japan, Sub-Saharan Africa, Mexico and Canada. Madagascar, Réunion and some Caribbean destinations are examples of exceptions that are, as non-European locations, connected to a European air community.

Our analysis reveals that many potential predictors of global influenza virus spread are not associated with viral lineage movement, specifically, geographical proximity, demography and economic measures, antigenic divergence, epidemiological synchronity and seasonality do not yield noticeable support (Fig. 2) . Instead, we find consistent and strong evidence that air passenger flow is the dominant driver of the global dissemination of H3N2 influenza viruses. This is reflected in both the estimated size of the effect of this variable (*1 on a log scale) and the statistical support for its inclusion in the model (posterior probability .0.93 and Bayes factor .760). This effect size means that viral lineage movement rates are about 15 times higher for connections with the highest passenger flow compared to connections with the lowest flow, controlling for all other predictors. The result is robust when we repeat the analysis (i) using different partitions of sampling locations (air communities and different geographic partitions, Fig. 2 ), (ii) using different sequence sub-samples for the air communities (Fig. S1 ), (iii) using the full data set or a small but more balanced number of sub-samples (Fig. S2) , and (iv) using a more liberal prior specification on predictor inclusion (Fig. S3) . We down-sampled particular air communities or geographic regions relative to their population sizes (Text S1), which still leaves considerable heterogeneity in sample sizes, explaining why they are included as an explanatory variable in the GLM model. Our aim is not to demonstrate a role for sample sizes in phylogeography, but by explicitly including them as predictive variables, we raise the credibility that other predictors are not included in the model because of sampling bias. We note that the sample size predictors may in fact absorb some of the effect of air travel because a GLM model that only considers passenger flux as a predictor of H3N2 movement among the air communities results in a higher mean effect of size of about 1.5.

To also explore spatial dynamics at smaller scales, we further partition large geographical regions that are administratively coherent, such as the USA, China, Japan and Australia, resulting in 26 global sampling regions (Text S1). In this analysis, air travel again predicts viral movement (posterior probability .0.99 and Bayes factor .18000), but the movement is also inversely associated with geographical distance between locations (posterior probability = 0.76 and Bayes factor = 87), and, less intuitively, with origin and destination population densities (although the size of the latter effects are weaker, Fig. 2 ). The negative association of population density with viral movement may suggest that commuting is less likely, per capita, to occur out of, or into, dense subpopulations.

Although not the main focus of the current study, our integrated approach also provides phylogeographic reconstructions that offer insights into the global source-sink dynamics of human influenza. The trunk or backbone of phylogenies reconstructed from temporally-sampled hemagglutinin genes (Fig. 3) represents the lineage that successfully persists from one epidemic year to the next [14, 33] . We determine the spatial history of this lineage using Markov rewards in the posterior tree distribution, thereby estimating the contribution of each location to the persistence of the trunk lineage from 2002 to 2006 (Fig. 3) . These estimates provide strong support for mainland China as the principal H3N2 source population, occupying close to 60% of the trunk time in the H3N2 phylogenies (Fig. 3) , followed by Southeast Asia, which comprises about 15% of the trunk time. We further examine temporal heterogeneity in the source-sink process by combining a summary of the estimated trunk location through time together with an phylogenetic summary in Fig. 3 impact of temporal sampling heterogeneity on these estimates because the Southeast Asian trunk dominance precedes a period of higher sampling availability for Southeast Asia relative to mainland China (Fig. 3) . The important role of mainland China in seeding the global seasonal spread of human influenza results in a high net migration out of this air community (Fig. S4) . However, air communities that do not contribute significantly to the trunk can also maintain high net outflow, in particular the USA, which may be seeded by relatively few introductions each year whilst exporting comparatively more viruses to other locations during the epidemic season.

In order to assess the extent to which evolutionary analyses such as ours benefit from integrating host mobility data, we examine their predictive performance by using them to predict the relative timing of the geographic spread of the pandemic H1N1 influenza variant that emerged in 2009. We conduct simulations of the spread of a novel pathogen out of Mexico using an SIR model whose transmission parameters are informed by epidemiological estimates obtained for pandemic H1N1 [31] and whose spatial spread is determined by one of four different migration rate models, each defined by a different matrix of movement rates among all pairs of locations (Methods). We measure the relative correspondence between the simulated and observed H1N1 peaks for each location except Mexico using a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r) and mean absolute error (MAE; in days) (Fig. 4 ). An equal rates model (A), which does not express any migration rate preference, results in a weak match (r~0:11, P = 0.73, MAE = 40.9 days) between the simulations and the observed spatial spread of H1N1 (Fig. 4) , indicating that the population sizes included in the SIR model for each region offer limited predictive performance. As expected, adding information on the number of airline passengers (model B) yields a large improvement in correspondence between simulations and observations (r~0:61, P = 0.03, MAE = 35.8 days). In contrast, a standard parameterrich phylogeographic model that is only informed by sequence data and not air traffic information (model C) yields only part of this improvement in predictive performance (r~0:47, P = 0.10, MAE = 39.4 days). However, if inference under model C is made more efficient by focusing on a small set of parameters (using BSSVS, [21] ; see Methods) then phylogeographic estimates yield a predictive performance (r~0:62, P = 0.02, MAE = 36.4 days, Fig. S5 ) that is close to that of the air travel model (B). Finally, The inclusion probabilities are defined by the indicator expectations E½d because they reflect the frequency at which the predictor is included in the model and therefore represent the support for the predictor. Indicator expectations corresponding to Bayes factor support values of 10 and 100 are represented by a thin and thick vertical line respectively in these bar plots. The contribution of each predictor, when included in the model (bDd~1), where b is the coefficient or effect size, is represented by the mean and credible intervals of the GLM coefficients on a log scale. NA 1 : no conditional effect size available because the predictor was never included in the model. We tested different population size and density measures, different incidence-based measures and different seasonal measures (Text S1), but only list the estimates for a representative predictor for the sake of clarity. The estimates for the full set of predictors are summarized for each sub-sampled data set in Fig. S5 . NA 2 : no indicator expectation or conditional effect size available because the predictor was not available for this discretization of the sequence data. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003932.g002 the GLM model (D) predicts the observed spread of H1N1 more accurately than all other models (r~0:82, P,0.01, MAE = 32.3), suggesting that global influenza transmission is best predicted by combining passenger flux data with the information on viral lineage movement contained in sequence data. The simulations generally correspond better with observed H1N1 peaks during the initial period of pandemic expansion, while the epidemic peaks for Russia and Africa occur significantly earlier in the simulations than in reality. This is likely due to the multi-peaked character of the regional epidemics (Text S1); the H1N1 virus spreads to most of the world during the first pandemic wave, whereas regions like Russia and Africa appeared to miss the first wave entirely. Seasonal effects that are unaccounted for by our simulation may at least partly explain the outliers, but they affect the models we aim to compare in a very similar way. Because of the outliers, we consider the non-parametric Spearman's r to be a more appropriate measure of correspondence than the MAE, but they are consistent in their model ranking. We note that absolute prediction errors can be considerably improved by only considering the 9 air communities that peaked prior to September, 2009, which returns a MAE of 11.2 day for the GLM model. However, because of the difficulties in establishing initial waves and their peaks, and the uncertainty in our epidemiological model, we caution against more detailed interpretation of these simulations beyond the general trends we extract here.

The prevention and control of influenza at the global scale relies critically on our understanding of its mode of geographical dissemination. Here, we demonstrate that such dynamics are most powerfully investigated by combining phylogeographic history with empirical data on the patterns of human movement worldwide. Our analysis strongly suggests that air travel is key to global influenza spread, an intuitive result that has long been predicted by modeling studies (e.g. [5] ), but has, until now, remained difficult to obtain from empirical data. The dominant predictors of influenza spread will undoubtedly be scale-dependent, as indicated here by the importance of geographic distance as a predictor within more confined geographic areas (Fig. 2) , which may represent forms of human mobility other than air travel, such as workplace commuting [9] . This indicates that our statistical framework could also prove valuable in testing hypotheses at smaller scales, where the underlying spatial processes may be less obvious, provided adequate sequence and empirical movement data are available. One of the limitations of the current heterogeneous sampling of H3N2 sequences worldwide is that geographic partitions need to be adjusted to account for the number of samples per location, which results in regions of widely different areas and population sizes. More representative sampling across the globe, or within a more geographically confined area of interest, will allow for more appropriate geographic partitioning and may facilitate more detailed spatial hypothesis testing based on the associated demographic and mobility measures. In particular, if sequences were sampled appropriately then our inference method could incorporate the rich geographic data that is currently available as global gridded population data sets [34] . In addition, many of the predictors used here can be improved in accuracy and resolution, for example by accounting for seat occupancy and actual origin-destination flows in air traffic passenger fluxes.

Due to the difficulties associated with geographic partitioning, we used algorithms to optimally define communities in the global air transportation network as an alternative strategy to specify phylogeographic states, and subsequently show that our GLM results are robust to the different partitions used. Because air travel is a consistent and highly supported explanatory variable for global influenza dispersal, communities within the air transportation network are likely to provide the most appropriate spatial structuring of our data. However, in addition to the partitioning itself, further research is also needed to select the appropriate number of samples from the resulting regions to improve on ad hoc down-sampling based on population size.

Although identifying the causes of pathogen spread is of great importance in spatial epidemiology, integrating this information in evolutionary models also offers major advantages for phylogeographic reconstructions and their relevance to infectious disease surveillance and pandemic preparedness. By capturing a more realistic process of spatial spread, our novel approach results in more credible reconstructions of spatial evolutionary history, which may shed further light on the persistence and migration dynamics of human influenza viruses. Because of the importance of influenza dynamics for vaccine strain selection, different phylogeographic reconstructions have attempted to characterize the global population structure of the virus and have arrived at somewhat mixed findings [3, 14, 17] . This may be explained by the use of both different sampling and different methodology. The data and methods used here corroborate the explorations of antigenic and genetic divergence by [3] and demonstrate the prominence of mainland China and Southeast Asia as locations of trunk lineage persistence. Our findings are however based on roughly the same genetic data, and our approach of inferring the spatial history of the trunk lineage through Markov reward estimates may be viewed as the more direct, statistical equivalent of measuring strain location distance from the trunk [3] . Although we find a strong signal for the presence of the trunk lineage in mainland China and Southeast Asia, our analysis is restricted to the period 2002 to 2006, and thus we make no conclusions about the location of the trunk lineage outside of this period. The degree of temporal stochasticity in the source location of seasonal influenza and its heterogeneity among different influenza variants has yet to be determined and requires datasets of longer duration. Moreover, we suggest that analyses of future data sets that are more comprehensively sampled through time will also benefit from phylogeographic models that can accommodate temporal heterogeneity in movement rates. Such models may also improve the performance of some explanatory variables. For example, in the analysis presented here, we do not consider the absence of support for seasonality as a predictor in our GLM model as evidence against seasonality in H3N2 spread. Rather, it simply reflects the difficulty in incorporating seasonality into a time-homogeneous model of lineage movement. Developments are now underway to appropriately accommodate heterogeneity in spatial spread through time.

By using models to predict the observed global emergence of pandemic H1N1, we demonstrate that an approach that integrates passenger flux data with viral genetic data provides a more accurate prediction of global epidemic spread than those which include only one source of information. Although the prediction improvement of the combined data over the passenger flux data alone is not very large, it remains remarkable because we attempt to predict the spatial expansion of an epidemic lineage (pandemic H1N1) from the seasonal dynamics of another lineage (H3N2) and because the main process underlying the global dispersal of H3N2 influenza appears to be air travel itself. Passenger flux data among pairs of locations is symmetric, thus it is possible that the phylogeographic data is capable of capturing asymmetry in the seasonal process of viral spread, which may also be important in explaining the spatial expansion of pandemic H1N1. Investigations using more advanced simulation techniques, e.g. [35] , may be able to build upon the conceptual bridge between genetic data and epidemiological modeling implied by our findings. Future prediction efforts may also need to focus on alternative scenarios of spatial spread, as highlighted by the recent emergence of a novel avian influenza H7N9 lineage in China [36] . Should this virus evolve sustained human-to-human transmissibility, then airline-passenger data and flight routes from the outbreak regions in particular, would be able to pinpoint worldwide regions of immediate risk. If the virus remains restricted to avian hosts, however, risk maps for the transmission of avian influenza viruses (perhaps based on predictors calibrated against H5N1 avian influenza) may help to target H7N9 surveillance and control efforts. In conclusion, our framework is applicable to different infectious diseases and provides new opportunities for explicitly testing how host behavior and ecology shapes the spatial distribution of pathogen genetic diversity.

IFITM proteins are incorporated onto HIV-1 virion particles and negatively imprint their infectivity

Background: Interferon induced transmembrane proteins 1, 2 and 3 (IFITMs) belong to a family of highly related antiviral factors that have been shown to interfere with a large spectrum of viruses including Filoviruses, Coronaviruses, Influenza virus, Dengue virus and HIV-1. In all these cases, the reported mechanism of antiviral inhibition indicates that the pool of IFITM proteins present in target cells blocks incoming viral particles in endosomal vesicles where they are subsequently degraded.

Results: In this study, we describe an additional mechanism through which IFITMs block HIV-1. In virus-producing cells, IFITMs coalesce with forming virions and are incorporated into viral particles. Expression of IFITMs during virion assembly leads to the production of virion particles of decreased infectivity that are mostly affected during entry in target cells. This mechanism of inhibition is exerted against different retroviruses and does not seem to be dependent on the type of Envelope present on retroviral particles.

The results described here identify a novel mechanism through which IFITMs affect HIV-1 infectivity during the late phases of the viral life cycle. Put in the context of data obtained by other laboratories, these results indicate that IFITMs can target HIV at two distinct moments of its life cycle, in target cells as well as in virus-producing cells. These results raise the possibility that IFITMs could similarly affect distinct steps of the life cycle of a number of other viruses.

The interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are a family of highly related proteins composed of 5 members in humans (IFITM1, −2, −3, −5 and −10) [1, 2] . Of these, IFITM1, −2 and −3 have emerged as broadacting restriction factors capable of interfering with the replication of a number of viruses including Filoviruses, Coronaviruses, Influenza virus, Dengue virus and the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . To stress the importance that IFITMs play in the control of viral infection, IFITM3 knockout mice display increased mortality and viral burden following influenza A virus challenge [8, 13] and a specific polymorphism in the IFITM3 allele has been associated to increased susceptibility to influenza virus infection in humans [13, 14] .

At present, IFITMs have been described to welcome incoming viral particles and retain them into endosomal vesicles, where they are subsequently degraded [7, [9] [10] [11] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Interestingly, this mechanism of inhibition seems to be active against both pH-dependent and -independent viruses that require or not the low pH of endosomes to trigger viral-to-cell membrane fusion [22, 23] . The finding that pH-independent viruses can also functionally access the cytosol from endosomal vesicles likely explains the broad antiviral effects of IFITMs against these diverse classes of virus [24] .

IFITMs have been proposed to block hemifusion, the process whereby the outer, but not the inner, leaflet of the viral and cellular membranes merge [17] , possibly through the modulation of the intracellular levels of cholesterol, a particular intriguing hypothesis given that IFITM3 interacts with the vesicle-membrane-proteinassociated protein 1 (VAPA), a key component in cholesterol homeostasis [25] . The exact mechanism of antiviral inhibition by IFITMs remains however unclear, given that a recent study indicated that IFITM3 inhibits the transition from hemifusion to pore formation rather than hemifusion itself, in a cholesterol-independent manner [26] .

Given that IFITMs are typical interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and that the signature of a broad antiviral type I interferon response accompanies HIV-1 replication both in vivo and ex vivo [27, 28] , we reasoned that IFITMs may be present not only in target cells, but also in virus-producing cells during the de novo assembly of virion particles. Therefore, we explored the role that IFITMs may play in HIV-1 producing cells. The results we have obtained indicate that IFITMs coalesce with the structural protein Gag and are incorporated into HIV-1 viral particles both in established cell lines, as well as in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Virions incorporating IFITMs display decreased infectivity when compared to HIV-1 wild type particles in single round infection assays and a similar inhibition is observed for different retroviruses and Envelope (Env) pseudotypes. Virions incorporating IFITMs display a defect at the step of viral entry into target cells that well correlates with the infectivity defect measured here.

In conclusion, our results together with existing data in the literature indicate that IFITM proteins interfere with HIV-1 replication at two steps of the viral life cycle; in target cells by retaining incoming particles into endosomes and in virus-producing cells, by leading to the production of virions of decreased infectivity. This dual mechanism of inhibition may be similarly exerted against other viruses. Figure 1 Expression of IFITMs in virus producing cells affects the production of infectious HIV-1 viral particles. A) Representation of the experimental scheme used here. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with DNAs coding for single round infection-competent HIV-1 expressing GFP along with DNAs coding Flag-IFITMs. Virions were purified by ultracentrifugation through a 25% sucrose cushion, normalized by exogenous-RT (exo-RT) and used to challenge HeLaP4 or HEK293T cells bearing the appropriate HIV-1 receptors. Viral infectivity was measured 3 days later by flow cytometry in the case of GFP-coding viruses or 24 hours later by β-gal assay in the case of a complete NL4-3 proviral DNA (thanks to the HIV-1 LTR-β-gal reporter integrated in HeLaP4 cells). B) Typical FACS profiles obtained after this procedure. C) Normalized infectivity of viral particles obtained after flow cytometry analysis (left graph) or MAGI assay (right graph). D) As above, except that HIV-1 viruses coding GFP were pseudotyped with the indicated envelope proteins. E) As above, except that distinct retroviral vectors pseudotyped with VSVg and coding GFP were analyzed. F) As above, except that HIV-1 vectors bearing the indicated envelope were used to challenge the indicated target cells prior to flow cytometry analysis 3 days after infection. DCs and MDM were obtained after differentiation of primary human blood monocytes in GM-CSF/IL4 or M-CSF for 4 to 6 days. PBLs were activated with PHA/IL2 for 24 hours prior to viral challenge. All graphs present averages and SEM obtained from 4 to 6 independent experiments. *indicates statistically significant differences between WT and IFITMs conditions after a Student t test: p ≤ 0,05.

To determine whether they could affect the production of infectious HIV-1 viral particles, N-terminal Flag-tagged IFITMs were ectopically expressed along with DNAs coding for single round infection-competent HIV-1 viruses in HEK293T cells, according to the scheme depicted in Figure 1A . The transfected DNAs coded the HIV-1 Gag-Pol plus non-structural viral proteins, the indicated envelope, as well as a miniviral genome bearing a GFP expression cassette, except where a complete provirus was used, as indicated. Two days after transfection, supernatants were pre-cleared by centrifugation at low speed, then by filtration through a 0,45 μm syringe filter and were lastly purified by ultracentrifugation through a 25% sucrose cushion. Under these conditions, expression of IFITMs induced only a minor defect of virus production, as quantified by exogenous-RT activity (exo-RT, Additional file 1: Figure S1A ). To focus solely on the infectivity defect of retrieved viral particles, virions were normalized by exo-RT and then used to challenge either HeLaP4 cells stably expressing the HIV receptor/co-receptor CD4/CXCR4, prior to flow cytometry 3 days afterwards (a typical FACS profile is presented in Figure 1B ). Virions produced in the presence of the different IFITMs displayed reduced infectivity over wild type ones (70% to 75% reduction over a single round infection assay, Figure 1C , left graph). To determine whether this defect could be observed using a WT HIV-1 clone (NL4-3, a widely used proviral clone), the same experimental system was used on viruses produced by transfection of HEK293T cells with NL4-3 and IFITMs. Upon exo-RT normalization, virions were used to challenge HeLaP4 cells and viral infectivity was measured by β-galactosidase assay (MAGI) 24 hours afterwards, taking advantage of the HIV-1-LTR-β-Gal reporter stably integrated in these cells ( Figure 1C , right graph). Under these conditions, IFITMs imparted a similar infectivity defect to produced viruses (from 70 to 90% reduction for the different IFITMs).

To determine the extent of this phenotype, IFITMs were tested according to the same experimental approach described above using: HIV-1 vectors pseudotyped with the Gibbon ape leukemia virus envelope (GALV) and with the feline leukemia virus RD114 envelope (RD-TR, containing the cytoplasmic tail of the MLV amphotropic envelope for efficient pseudotyping of lentiviral particles, as described in [29] , Figure 1D ), or vectors derived from different GFP-coding retroviruses (simian immunodeficiency virus, SIV MAC ; murine leukemia virus, MLV) along with HIV-1, all pseudotyped with the pantropic Envelope VSVg ( Figure 1E ). After virus purification and normalization, viral particles were used to challenge HEK293T cells prior to flow cytometry analysis 3 days afterwards. Under these conditions, viruses produced in the presence of the different IFITMs displayed reduced infectivity that ranged from 90% in the case of SIV MAC -VSVg to 40% in the case of HIV-1-GALV or HIV-1-RD-TR. IFITM3 seemed to exert a lower effect on the infectivity of MLV-VSVg in comparison with IFITM1 and −2, yet this defect was clearly detectable and statistically significant. Overall, these results indicate that the expression of IFITMs during the phase of viral particles production impairs the infectivity of the retroviruses tested here.

To determine whether the infectivity defect of HIV-1 viral particles produced in the presence of IFITMs was target cell type specific, virions produced as described above were used to challenge primary monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs), MDMs or activated PBLs using appropriate Env pseudotypes ( Figure 1F ). The infectivity of viral particles was then assessed by measuring the amount of GFP-positive cells 3 days afterwards. Even using different target cells, viruses produced in the presence of IFITMs displayed a characteristic decrease in infectivity, indicating that this phenomenon is independent from the target cells.

To determine how IFITMs affected HIV-1, cell lysates and viral preparations obtained after DNA transfection and virion purification by ultracentrifugation through 25% sucrose were analyzed by WB ( Figure 2A ). Under these conditions, cell lysates displayed a robust expression of all viral proteins tested. When viruses were analyzed, no notable variations were observed in the amount of Gag and Env present in the different preparations produced in the presence or absence of IFITMs (Figure 2A for a WB analysis and Additional file 1: Figure S1B for a precise quantification of gp120 and p24 by ELISA). Surprisingly, IFITMs were detected in viral preparations, suggesting that they could be virion-associated proteins. Next, we produced HIV-1 viral particles in the presence of a variable amount of IFITMs by transfecting different amounts of IFITMcoding DNAs for a constant amount of Gag-Pol and Env DNAs. Purified virion particles were then normalized by exo-RT and either analyzed by WB ( Figure 2B ), or used to challenge HeLaP4 cells ( Figure 2C ). IFITMs were incorporated in a dose dependent manner in virion particles and the infectivity of virion particles decreased proportionally to the levels of IFITMs incorporated, overall suggesting a dose response inhibition of IFITMs on viral infectivity.

To further support the finding that IFITMs are bona fide virion-associated proteins, supernatants obtained and purified after transfection of HEK293T cells with HIV-1 and IFITMs were layered onto a linear OptiprepTM gradient (5 to 20% w/v) and then ultracentrifuged for 45 minutes at 28,000 rpm for velocity gradient analyses. Aliquots were harvested from the top of the gradient, precipitated with TCA and analyzed by WB ( Figure 2D ). The signals obtained after WB were quantified by densitometry and were plotted here to indicate the percentage of each protein present in each fraction with respect to the overall protein present ( Figure 2D , for space constraint the graph is presented only for IFITM3). Under these conditions, more than 95% of the total IFITMs co-migrated with HIV-1 CA in velocity gradients. These results along with similar co-migration observed between these proteins upon linear sucrose equilibrium density gradients (data not shown) indicate that IFITMs are virion-associated proteins.

Given that a recent report suggested that IFITM3 could be associated to exosomes upon overexpression in HEK293T cells [30] and given that exosomes share numerous characteristics with retroviral particles, we carried out CD45-depletion assays to determine whether IFITMs were associated to HIV-1 virion particles or to co-purifying exosomes. This assay takes advantage of a technique developed by the Ott lab that is based on the fact that CD45 is incorporated in exosomes, but is excluded from retroviral particles [31] . Given that CD45 is a T cell marker, we first obtained stable cell lines expressing each IFITM in SupT1 cells and then infected these cells with high MOIs of HIV-1 to obtain a large number of virion producing cells. Virion particles were then retrieved 6 days after and were then treated with CD45magnetic beads or not prior to WB analysis ( Figure 2E ). Under these conditions, CD45 was efficiently removed Figure 2 IFITMs are HIV-1 virion associated proteins. A) HEK293T cells were transfected with DNAs coding IFITMs and HIV-1 and two days after, both cell lysates and supernatant purified by ultracentrifugation through a 25% sucrose cushion were harvested and analyzed by WB. The panels present typical results obtained out of 10 independent experiments. B and C) HEK293T cells were transfected as above by maintaining a fixed amount of Gag-Pol/Env and by varying the amount of DNAs coding the different IFITMs. Virion particles were purified by ultracentrifugation, normalized by exo-RT and either analyzed by WB to determine the amount of IFITMs incorporated onto the virion particles (B), or used to challenge HEK293T cells to determine their infectivity (C). D) Virions produced in the presence of IFITMs were first concentrated and purified through sucrose as described above then layered onto a linear OptiprepTM velocity gradient (5 to 20% w/v) for an ultracentrifugation step of 45 minutes at 28,000 rpm. Aliquots were harvested from the top of the gradient, precipitated with TCA and analyzed by WB. The proportion of CA and IFITMs present in each fraction with respect to the total CA and IFITMs in all fractions was determined by densitometry and is presented here solely for IFITM3 due to space constraints. The density of each fraction was determined prior to TCA precipitation with a bench densitometer and is presented here as a dotted grey line (g/mL). The graph and associated WB panels are representative of 3 independent experiments. E) Virion particles produced from SupT1 cells stably expressing Flag-IFITMs were subjected or not to CD45 depletion, prior to WB analysis. The Western blot panels are representative of 3 independent experiments. by viral preparations. However, the amount of IFITMs present in HIV-1 viral preparations was unaffected by the treatment, except for a small decrease observed in the case of IFITM1. Overall, these results indicate that IFITMs are bona fide virion-associated proteins.

IFITMs partly co-localize on intracellular membranes with HIV-1 Gag

To determine how IFITMs could be embarked into HIV-1 viral particles, we analyzed the degree of intracellular co-localization existing between IFITMs and Gag, the main structural element of retroviral particles. To this end, cells were transfected as above in the presence of a small amount of Gag-GFP, prior to confocal microscopy analysis ( Figure 3A and B). As previously reported, all IFITMs were found at the plasma membrane, although more specific patterns could be observed for individual IFITMs (more prominent intracellular localization of IFITM2 and higher cell membrane distribution of IFITM1). HIV-1 Gag displayed an heterogeneous and mostly punctuate intracellular localization pattern, as extensively reported by others [32] and not surprisingly the two signals overlapped at least partially ( Figure 3B , depicts a two-dimensional graph presenting pixel intensities for the cells presented above). The degree of reciprocal colocalization between Gag and IFITMs was more carefully quantified by measuring the Manders overlap coefficient ( Figure 3C ). From 50 to 65% of IFITMs was found to co-localize with Gag and about 70% of Gag co-localized with IFITMs, which is overall not surprising in light of the natural intracellular distribution of these proteins. No major relocalization of either IFITMs or Gag was noted upon co-expression, indicating that these proteins are unlikely to influence the trafficking of each other. So, overall this analysis indicates that in light of their natural membrane distribution, IFITMs can find themselves at sites in which HIV-1 virion particles assembly takes place, providing a reason for their incorporation in HIV-1 virions.

To further confirm that nascent HIV-1 viral particles could recruit IFITMs, cryo-EM was performed on cells co-expressing HIV-1 and IFITM3 using anti-p24 and anti-Flag antibodies conjugated to gold beads of different sizes ( Figure 3D ). The results obtained with this analysis indicated that IFITMs are indeed present at sites of Gag budding, further supporting the notion that IFITMs are truly incorporated into HIV-1 virion particles.

To determine whether the incorporation of IFITM proteins onto HIV-1 virions could be observed in conditions of endogenous expression, we first tested several antibodies for their ability to specifically recognize individual IFITM members (on HEK293T cells transfected with the individual IFITMs, Additional file 2: Figure S2 ). This analysis indicated a certain level of cross-recognition between antibodies (particularly with the anti-IFITM2 and −3 antibodies). For this reason, we decided to detect the endogenous expression of IFITMs using a pool of the 3 antibodies. We first determined the pattern of expression of IFITMs in different established cell lines and primary cells ( Figure 4A ). Given that IFITMs are interferon-stimulated genes, these cells were also stimulated for 24 hours with 1000 U/mL of IFNα. The basal expression of IFITMs varied among cell types and was undetectable in HEK293T cells, unless IFNα was provided. HeLa cells expressed instead robust levels of IFITMs even in the absence of IFNα, although this stimulus further increased their expression. Similarly, the primary human cells examined here expressed undetectable/ low amounts of IFITMs under standard conditions, but expression of IFITMs was robustly induced by IFNα stimulation. This trend was reproducibly observed in four distinct donors, although the basal levels of expression of IFITMs displayed clear donor-to donor variations.

To determine whether endogenous IFITMs could be incorporated into HIV-1 particles, we first compared virions issued from HEK293T versus HeLa cells treated or not with IFNα ( Figure 4B ). Twenty-four hours after transfection with HIV-1 coding DNAs, cells were washed and then treated with 1000U/mL of IFNα for further 48 hours, prior to virion particle purification. Virion particles were then either analyzed by WB or used to challenge HeLaP4 cells upon exo-RT purification to determine their infectivity by flow cytometry analysis 3 days afterwards. When HIV-1 virions were produced in HEK293T cells, no detectable amounts of IFITMs were found, irrespectively of IFN stimulation suggesting that IFITMs may have to reach a certain amount to be promptly incorporated into virions. In contrast, virion produced in HeLa cells incorporated readily detectable levels of IFITMs and this incorporation was increased upon IFN stimulation. When virion particles produced in these conditions were normalized and used to challenge HeLaP4 cells, a drastic decrease in infectivity was observed in virions produced in HeLa cells versus viruses produced in HEK293T cells and IFN stimulation did not grossly modify these differences.

Next, a similar analysis was conducted on primary macrophages undergoing spreading HIV-1 infection. MDM were infected with replication competent HIV-1 (ADA at a multiplicity of infection, MOI, of 0,1). Cells were washed and aliquots of the supernatant were harvested at different days post infection to monitor viral spread by exogenous-RT activity ( Figure 4C ) and cell lysates and virion particles were also harvested at the indicated times post infection. The intracellular levels of IFITMs increased over time during spreading HIV-1 infection, in agreement with the upregulation of an IFNdependent transcriptional program described in a number of previous studies ([ [33] [34] [35] [36] ), although not all ( [37] ). As expected, when virion particles produced at different days after infection were examined, IFITMs were incorporated into HIV-1 particles proportionally to their intracellular levels of expression. Of note, only a limited virus production was observed at day 3 post infection, as expected from the low levels of replication ongoing at this early time point. Virus production was however more robust at later time points, so that the intrinsic infectivity of virions produced from MDM at day 6 and 9 could be assessed after a MAGI assay on HeLaP5 cells. Under these conditions, virions obtained at day 6 displayed higher infectivity than viruses obtained at day 9, in agreement with the higher incorporation of IFITMs in the latter.

Overall, this set of data indicates that endogenous IFITMs are incorporated into virion particles and exert an antiviral effect in a manner that seems proportional to their intracellular levels. Given that viral infectivity is likely multifactorial, we believe this data suggest that IFITMs may be an important parameter of viral infectivity, although we believe it unlikely to be the only one.

To further support the argument that IFITMs affect the infectivity of newly produced viral particles under endogenous conditions, we silenced IFITMs from virus-producing cells and given that each IFITM exerts an antiviral effect, the three of them were targeted simultaneously. We first used HeLaP4 cells that express IFITMs at steady state. HeLa cells were challenged with miR30-shRNAs specific for the 3 IFITMs or control target sequences (luciferase), and shortly selected with puromycin. Then, cells were challenged with replication competent HIV-1 (NL4-3 at an MOI 1) to obtain a consistent amount of virus-producing cells. After extensive cell washing and trypsin treatment to remove non internalized virus, cells were re-seeded and two days after, cells were lysed and newly produced viral particles were purified, normalized by exo-RT and used for a WB analysis, as well as to challenge target cells ( Figure 5A ). As expected, downregulation of the intracellular levels of IFITMs led to viruses that incorporated less IFITMs. When the infectivity of exo-RT normalized viral particles produced from control versus IFITM knockdown cells was assessed, the formers displayed a statistically significant increase in infectivity (two fold).

Next, we sought to achieve the same goal in primary MDM obtained from 2 donors. Silenced MDM could not be maintained long enough to perform a classical spreading assay, nor sufficient virus could be obtained for a WB analysis of viral particles. However, this setup was sufficient to obtain viral particles whose infectivity could be analyzed by MAGI assay.

To increase silencing efficiency in these cells, lentiviruses coding control or IFITM-specific miR30-shRNAs were provided along with virion-like particles containing the Vpx protein of SIV MAC (VLPs-Vpx), tool that allows an efficient step of reverse transcription and infection of lentiviruses in myeloid cells [38, 39] . Two days afterwards, cells were challenged as above with R5-tropic replication- Figure 4 IFITMs are interferon-regulated proteins that display heterogeneous cell type dependent expression and appear incorporated in HIV-1 virions proportionally to their intracellular levels. A) The ectopic expression levels of IFITMs in HEK293T cells used before were compared to the endogenous expression of IFITMs in different cells, incubated or not with IFNα (at 1000 U/mL for 24 hours). Given that the antibodies in our hands did not distinguish between IFITM members anti-IFITM1, −2 and −3 antibodies were used together, so that all three forms are recognized. B) HEK293T and HeLaP4 cells were transfected with DNAs coding HIV-1-gfp and twenty-four hours later cells were stimulated with 1000U/mL of IFNα for further two days. Virions were then purified and analyzed by WB and upon exo-RT normalization they were used to challenge HeLa P4 cells. C) Primary macrophages obtained upon differentiation of monocytes in M-CSF for 4 days were challenged with an MOI of 0,1 of the R5-tropic HIV-1 strain ADA. Aliquots of the supernatant were harvested every few days and the extent of viral spread through the culture was measured by exo-RT activity. Cells and virion particles were harvested at the indicated time points after infection. Virion particles obtained from day 6 and 9 were normalized by exo-RT activity, while the amount of virus obtained at day 3 was too low to be quantified further. Exo-RT normalized virions obtained at day 6 and 9 were used to challenge HeLaP5 cells for a MAGI assay. The graph presents a typical replication curve obtained upon infection of ADA in primary MDM and the dotted line represents the limit of detection of the assay. All WB panels present representative results obtained out of 3 to 5 independent experiments and donors, while the graphs present averages and SEM of 3 independent experiments. competent ADA at an MOI of 1 prior to extensive cell washing and trypsin treatment. Viral particles produced by knockdown cells were then harvested 4 to 6 days after and upon exo-RT normalization, viruses were used on HeLaP5 cells (expressing the CCR5 co-receptor) for a MAGI assay ( Figure 5B ). Under these conditions, viruses produced in MDM silenced for IFITMs displayed a remarkable increase in their infectivity over a single round infection assay, confirming the positive effect that the removal of IFITMs plays on the infectivity of viral particles. Of note, the basal expression of IFITMs was higher in miR30-shRNA transduced MDM, irrespectively of the target sequence, when compared to untreated cells (for example, compare the basal levels of expression observed here with the one of Figure 4A ). We believe this is due to the detection of the HIV vectors used for silencing, or to the detection of its end products, ie double stranded RNAs, as described in [40] [41] [42] . However, since equal conditions were used for control and specific knockdowns, we believe this not to be a confounding factor in the analysis of the results.

Lastly, we silenced IFITMs in Jurkat cells and since IFITMs were moderately upregulated upon IFNα treatment, we compared the effects that IFNα played on viral replication in both control or IFITM-knockdown cells ( Figure 5C ). Silenced cells were challenged with replication competent NL4-3 and viral replication was monitored through the accumulation of exo-RT in the culture supernatants at different days post infection. Under these conditions, viral replication was increased by IFITMs silencing in both IFN-stimulated and unstimulated conditions over control silenced cells, indicating that IFITMs may provide already a basal level of resistance even in non stimulated Jurkat T cells. Given that in addition to the direct decrease in viral particles infectivity that we describe here, IFITMs have been previously described to affect the entry of HIV-1 when expressed in target cells [9] and given that the assay of spreading infection does not allow the distinction between these two effects, viral particles retrieved at the end of the culture were normalized by exo-RT activity and used to challenge HeLaP4 cells to determine their intrinsic infectivity in a single round infection assay ( Figure 5D ). Under these conditions, the infectivity of viral particles produced in IFITM-knockdown cells was higher than the one of viruses produced in control cells and this increase was of 1,6 fold in unstimulated Jurkat cells, but reached 5 fold in IFN-stimulated cells, suggesting again that IFITMs do play an antiviral role in Jurkat cells that is exacerbated upon IFN stimulation. Of note, we have already determined that IFNα does not influence the early phases of infection in HeLa cells [43] , so that its presence is unlikely to be a confounding factor in the determination of the infectivity of viral particles in this cell type. Overall, these results further strengthen the notion that IFITMs negatively interfere with the infectivity of HIV-1 viral particles and do so in different cell types in which they are naturally expressed.

To determine at which step the incorporation of IFITMs affected viral infectivity, virion particles produced in presence or absence of IFITMs were purified and normalized as described above and used to challenge target cells according to two methods (schematically indicated in Figure 6A ). Target cells were incubated with an equal amount of viral particles at 4°C, extensively washed and then shifted at 37°C to induce virus entry into the cell. After 2 hours, cells were treated with trypsin to remove extracellular virus and the amount of intracellular p24 was determined by ELISA. Under these conditions, all IFITMs-HIV-1 particles presented an entry defect, indicating that IFITMs interfered with the ability of virion particles to enter target cells (from 40% to 70% Figure 6B ). To further support this argument, viruses were produced in the presence of Vpr-Blam. This protein is incorporated into virion particles and is released in the cytoplasm of target cells after viral-to-cell membrane fusion where it can cleave a fluorescent dye [44] . When viral particles incorporating Vpr-Blam were analyzed a similar decrease in entry was measured for virions incorporating IFITMs as compared to WT ( Figure 6C , from 50 to 70%). Although this defect appeared more pronounced in the case of IFITM2 than of IFITM1/3, this difference did not reach statistical significance.

Overall, these results indicate that the incorporation of IFITMs onto HIV-1 viruses interferes with the ability of viral particles to enter in target cells.

In the work presented here we describe a novel feature related to the biology of IFITMs, namely their ability to be Figure 6 IFITMs incorporation into HIV-1 viral particles affects viral infectivity by interfering with entry of the virus in target cells. Normalized NL4-3 Env bearing HIV-1 virions produced in the presence or absence of IFITMs were bound to HeLaP4 cells at 4°C prior to extensive cell washing. The temperature was then raised at 37°C to induce entry. The extent of entry was then measured according to the two assays schematically depicted in A. B) Two hours after entry, cells were extensively washed, treated with trypsin to remove external virion particles and then lysed. The amount of cell-associated p24 was measured by ELISA. C) After exo-RT normalization, equal amounts of viruses incorporating Vpr-BLAM were used to challenge HeLaP4 cells for 2 hours. Cells were then incubated with the fluorescent dye CCF2 prior to FACS analysis. Graphs present averages obtained from 3 to 8 independent experiments. *p ≤ 0,05, according to a Student t test.

incorporated into HIV-1 virion particles and to decrease the particle infectivity. So far, IFITMs have been essentially studied in the context of target cells, where their overexpression induces a strong antiviral phenotype by trapping incoming viral particles in endosomes. This antiviral activity is broad and targets, albeit with different efficiency, a large panel of viruses including HIV-1 [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Here, we report that the presence of IFITMs in virus producing cells leads to the production of virions of decreased infectivity. In light of the largely membrane distribution of the different IFITMs their incorporation into retroviral particles is not surprising. The diverse spectrum of envelopes and of retroviruses on which IFITMs exert similar effects leads us the hypothesize that this mechanism of inhibition does not target a specific viral domain, but rather takes advantage of the manner in which HIV and more generally retroviruses assemble. In this respect, the membrane distribution of IFITMs strongly suggests that passive incorporation is the most plausible explanation for their packaging in retroviral particles. This incorporation does not seem to occur to the detriment of the one of Env, as IFITMs do not modify the Env to Gag ratio of virion particles (data not shown).

At present, although our preferred hypothesis is that the physical presence of IFITMs is required to lower the infectivity of viral particles, we cannot exclude the possibility that IFITMs act on producing cells and that this action in turn leads to the production of viral particles of decreased infectivity. Despite the fact that the overall restrictive phenotype would nonetheless remain, the underlaying mechanism would be profoundly different, as in this case the incorporation of IFITMs would be probably a mark, but not a cause of the infectivity defect described here. We believe the future identification of IFITM mutants that have lost the ability to be incorporated into viral particles may help us distinguish between these possibilities and efforts toward this goal are ongoing.

IFITMs-HIV-1 particles are impaired at entry, the same step inhibited when IFITMs are present in the opposite topology, i.e. in target cell membranes [17, 26] . At present, the mechanism through which IFITMs block endosomal fusion of incoming viruses remains controversial [25, 26] and this mechanism could be molecularly distinct from the one at play here. Multiple hypotheses have been put forward to explain the antiviral effect of IFITMs in target cells. IFITMs have been reported to increase the intracellular levels of cholesterol [25] and variations in cholesterol have been associated to defects in membrane fusion, viral production and are likely to play an important role in multiple physiological processes [45] [46] [47] [48] .

Alternatively, IFITMs have been proposed to sterically rigidify membranes in which they insert leading to fusion inhibition, as recently proposed [26] . This hypothesis is supported by the finding that IFITMs can interact between themselves, although the extent of this multimerization has not been fully examined [49] . Whether these mechanisms are at play here and more importantly whether the same mechanism/s of inhibition is at play in target cells and in virion particles remains to be determined.

When compared to their effect on other viruses, as for example Influenza virus, IFITMs display a milder antiviral phenotype against HIV-1 ex vivo. However, this does not preclude an important role of IFITMs in shaping HIV-1 quasi-species evolution in vivo, possibly as part of the more complex interferon response. An increasing number of reports indicate that the susceptibility of HIV-1 to IFNα changes during the course of the disease in infected patients [50, 51] and HIV-1 strains displaying increased resistance to IFITMs have been selected ex vivo [52] . These results suggest that the evolutionary pressure exerted by IFITMs on HIV-1 is likely not neutral. In this respect, it will be of interest to determine whether multiple primary HIV-1 strains display distinct susceptibilities to IFITMs and whether particular IFITM haplotypes can be associated to distinct HIV-1 outcomes, as is the case for Influenza virus [13] .

In conclusion, our study uncovers a novel interesting aspect of the biology of IFITMs and provides an interesting example of how a single restriction factor may interfere at two different steps of the viral life cycle using a seemingly similar mechanism. These findings may apply to other pathogens and yield a more complex view of the manner in which this emerging family of restriction factors can interfere with viral pathogens.

N-term Flag-IFITMs-DNAs were obtained from Dr. Guo (Drexel University, Doylestown, USA). The following DNA expression constructs have been described before: Gag-Pol + non-structural proteins and corresponding viral genomes coding GFP that yield single-cycle infection-competent viruses derived from different retroviruses [38] ; replicationcompetent HIV-1 proviral clones (X4-or R5-tropic, NL4-3 and ADA, respectively); VSVg and HIV-1 envelopes; the Vpr-Blam and Gag-GFP [32, 44] ; GALV and RD-TR [29] . For WB and immuno-gold analyses, the following antibodies were used: anti-Tubulin (Sigma), anti-Flag (F7425, Sigma), anti-Gag/p24 (clone 183-H5C from the AIDS Reagents Program of the NIH), anti-Env (for WB: #ab21179, Abcam), anti-IFITM1, −2 and −3 (#60074-1-Ig, 12769-1-AP and 11714-1-AP, respectively, Proteintech), anti-CD45 (Becton Dickinson). IFNα (Eurobio) was used at a final concentration of 1,000 U/mL.

Viral particles were produced by calcium phosphate DNA transfection of HEK293T cells (obtained through the CelluloNet facility of the UMS3444 Biosciences Gerland). Single-cycle infection-competent viruses were produced by co-transfection of 3 DNAs coding Gag-Pol, a miniviral genome coding GFP and Env (for a 10 cm plate: 4, 4 and 1 μg each, respectively) and IFITMs were added at a Gag-Pol/IFITMs ratio of 1 to 3. When indicated, this ratio was lowered to 1 to 0,07 by modifying the amount of IFITM transfected for a constant amount of Gag-Pol and Env coding DNAs. Media was replaced 12 hours after transfection and viral supernatants were collected 48 hours after. Supernatants were first centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 minutes, then filtered through a 0,45 μm syringe-filter, prior to purification by ultracentrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 2 hours through a 25% (w/v) sucrose cushion. After ultracentrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in DMEM and normalized by either exogenous-RT activity or by an in-house anti-p24 ELISA, as described [39] . Viral infectivity was determined 3 days after cell challenge by flow cytometry analysis (in the case of GFP-coding vectors) or 24 hours PI by β-gal assay in HeLaP4 cells (stably expressing the CD4/CXCR4 receptors plus an HIV-1-LTR-β-gal reporter cassette, obtained through the CelluloNet facility of the UMS3444 Biosciences Gerland) with replicationcompetent HIV-1. The Env-Gag ratio of viral particles produced in the presence or absence of IFITMs was carried out by gp120 and p24 ELISA, as described [53] .

This procedure was essentially described in [31] . To obtain virions issued from CD45 expressing cells (CD45 is indeed mostly a T cell marker), SupT1 stably expressing Flag-IFITMs were challenged with replication-competent NL4-3 at an MOI of 3 to induce a rapid burst of infection and robust production of virion particles. Virions produced upon ongoing infection were harvested 6 days after infection and were incubated with magnetic beads coupled with an anti-CD45 antibody (Miltenyi) for 2 hours. Beads were then recuperated on a magnetic support following the manufacturer's instructions. Bound and unbound material was analyzed by WB.

Monocytes and PBLs were purified from the blood of healthy donors by successive Ficoll and Percoll gradients followed by negative depletion (Miltenyi and [39] . Monocytes were differentiated into macrophages (MDM) or DCs with M-CSF or GM-CSF/IL4 for 4 to 6 days (AbCys), while PBLs were activated with IL2 (150 U/mL, AIDS Reagents and Reference Program of the NIH) and PHA (1 μg/mL, Sigma). For replicative infections, cells were challenged with an MOI of 0,1 of ADA. Every 3-4 days aliquots of the cell supernatant were harvested and replaced with fresh media. The extent of viral replication in the cell culture was measured by exo-RT activity.

Supernatants produced by transient DNA transfection of HEK293T cells were first concentrated by ultracentrifugation through a 25% sucrose cushion, as described in the Methods section, then resuspended and layered onto a linear OptiprepTM gradient (5 to 20% w/v) prior to ultracentrifugation for 45 minutes at 28,000 rpm. Fractions collected from the top of the gradient were then precipitated with a final concentration of 10% TCA and analyzed by WB. The intensity of the retrieved bands was quantified by densitometry. The amount of CA and IFITMs present in the different fractions was then normalized to the total amount of CA and IFITMs present in all fractions (set to 100%). Prior to precipitation the density of each fraction was measured using a bench densitometer.

HEK293T cells were grown on 0,01% poly-L-lysine coated coverslips and analyzed 24 hours post-transfection with DNAs coding: IFITMs, HIV-1 Gag-Pol plus non-structural viral proteins, NL4-3 Env, a miniviral genome coding CD8, as well as a small amount of Gag-GFP (ratio 3:1:1:1:0,1). After Formalin fixation, cells were incubated with the following antibodies: anti-Flag (F7425, Sigma), followed by DyLight 649-conjugated sheep, or FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (STAR36D649 AbD serotec and FI-1000 Vector). DAPI-containing mounting medium was finally used (DAPI Fluormount G, Southern biotech). Images were acquired using a spectral Leica sp5 and analyzed with the Fiji software [54] . Two-dimensional graphs representing pixel intensities (gray level) were plotted along a 30μm lines (yellow on Figure 3B ), using Plot Profile tool in Image-J. The extent of reciprocal co-localization between Gag and IFITMs was quantified using the Manders overlap coefficient (Fuji image software) on more than 40 cells per condition.

Ultra-thin cryosections and immunogold labeling HEK293T cells transfected as described above were fixed for one hour with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.6), washed and then infused with sucrose 2.3 M for 2 hours (4°C). Ninety nm ultra-thin cryosections were made at −110°C on a LEICA UCT cryoultramicrotome. Sections were retrieved with a methylcellulose 2%/sucrose 2.3 M mixture (1:1) and collected onto formvar/carbon coated nickel grids. Sections were incubated with anti-Flag and anti-p24 antibodies (F7425, Sigma and KAL-1, DAKO). After extensive washing, grids were incubated with gold-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Aurion) and goat-anti-mouse IgG (10 and 5 nm, Sigma). Grids were washed, post-fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde and rinsed. Contrasting step was performed by incubating grids on drops of uranyl acetate 4%/methycellulose 2% mixture (1:10). The sections were imaged on a transmission electron microscope at 100 kV (JEOL 1011, Tokyo, Japan).

Exo-RT-normalized viral preparations were used to infect HeLaP4 cells for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were then extensively washed and then shifted at 37°C for 2 hrs. Prior to lysis and p24 ELISA, cells were treated with trypsin to remove non-internalized virus. The Vpr-Blam assay was carried out according to a well-described protocol [44] .

Silencing experiments miR30-shRNAs were introduced into the desired cell types by HIV-1 vector-mediated transduction [55] . Briefly, selfinactivating (SIN) lentivectors were produced by cotransfection of HEK293T cells using a viral genome bearing a miR30-shRNAs-Puromycin cassette (a mixture of two target sequences per gene was used). Virions were then purified and normalized by exo-RT, so that an identical viral input was used to challenge target cells with control or with the overall pool of IFITM1,2,3 specific miR30-shRNAs. The silencing procedure was then adapted experimentally for each cell type to reach the best possible compromise between high silencing efficiency and optimal cell survival. In the case of HeLaP4 cells, after a short Puromycin selection (4 days), cells were seeded and used as virus producing cells. To this end, cells were challenged with an MOI of 1 of replication competent HIV-1 (NL4-3) to obtain a substantial fraction of virus-producing cells. After extensive cell washing and trypsin treatment to remove non-internalized virus, cells were seeded and newly produced viruses were harvested 2 to 3 days afterwards from the supernatant of knockdown cells. Virions were normalized by exo-RT and used to challenge naïve HeLaP4 cells. The amount of infectious viral particles present in the different preparations was then assessed 24 hours later following a MAGI assay on these cells. For silencing experiments in primary macrophages, cells were similarly transduced in the presence of virion-like particles containing Vpx (VLPs-Vpx provided at an MOIequivalent of 0,5) that increase the overall transduction efficiency of lentiviruses in human myeloid cells by removing a restriction at reverse transcription, according to a well-established protocol [39] . In this case, silenced cells were used in the absence of Puromycin selection and were challenged with an MOI of 1 of the R5 tropic replicationcompetent ADA. After extensive cell washing and trypsin treatment, virions were harvested 4 to 6 days afterwards and similarly normalized by exo-RT prior to challenge of HeLaP5 cells (expressing the CCR5 co-receptor) and MAGI assay. In the case of Jurkat cells, silenced cells were kept in Puromycin selection and used in replicative infections using the NL4-3 virus. Aliquots of the cell supernatant were harvested at different time points and the extent of viral spread was assessed by exo-RT activity. To determine the intrinsic infectivity of viral particles produced in Jurkat cells treated as mentioned in the text, viral particles were retrieved at day 9 post infection to obtain sufficient amount of virus for our analysis, then viral preparations were normalized by exo-RT activity and used to challenge naïve HeLaP4 reporter cells. The infectivity of normalized viral particles was then determined by a MAGI assay 24 hours later.

Target sequences were as follows: luciferase (acc.n°D

New Insights in Recurrent HCV Infection after Liver Transplantation

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a small-enveloped RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family. Since first identified in 1989, HCV has been estimated to infect 170 million people worldwide. Mostly chronic hepatitis C virus has a uniform natural history, from liver cirrhosis to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. The current therapy for HCV infection consists of a combination of Pegylated interferon and ribavirin. On the other hand, HCV-related liver disease is also the leading indication for liver transplantation. However, posttransplant HCV re-infection of the graft has been reported to be universal. Furthermore, the graft after HCV re-infection often results in accelerated progression to liver failure. In addition, treatment of recurrent HCV infection after liver transplantation is often compromised by enhanced adverse effects and limited efficacy of interferon-based therapies. Taken together, poor outcome after HCV re-infection, regardless of grafts or recipients, poses a major issue for the hepatologists and transplant surgeons. The aim of this paper is to review several specific aspects regarding HCV re-infection after transplant: risk factors, current therapeutics for HCV in different stages of liver transplantation, cellular function of HCV proteins, and molecular mechanisms of HCV entry. Hopefully, this paper will inspire new strategies and novel inhibitors against recurrent HCV infection after liver transplantation and greatly improve its overall outcome.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) was a member of Flaviviridae family virus, and seven major genotypes (Genotype 1∼7a) have been identified with distinct regional distribution patterns. HCV is a major cause of chronic hepatitis worldwide, and end-stage liver disease caused by HCV has increasingly become the leading indication for liver transplantation (LT). It has been well known that HCV reinfection following LT examined by HCV RNA detection using the polymerase chain reaction occurs almost universally [1] . The natural history of HCV reinfection is substantially changed after LT with accelerated rate of cirrhosis recurrence of 8-44% in 5-7 years [2] . It has been pointed out that HCV reinfects the liver graft at time of reperfusion intraoperatively [3] . The virus source is attributed to the blood itself with a high probability [4] .

The viral load can return to the pretransplant values within 4 days after transplantation and may be influenced by the usage of corticosteroids [5] . Acute hepatitis occurs between 2-5 months after transplant, and it is characterized by acute lobular hepatitis [4] . In the early reinfection stage, the graft injury occurs only after 3 weeks. Chronic hepatitis is established about 6-12 months after transplantation. The stage of chronic hepatitis is characterized by a decrease of viral load and a pattern of immune-mediated injury. A variant form of posttransplant HCV infection is cholestatic hepatitis C that occurs in <10% of patients, frequently associated with high viral load and immunosuppression. Usually, it occurs within 1-6 months after transplant and can progress to hepatic failure in 3-6 months [6] . This form is characterized by very high viral load, cellular ballooning, low inflammation, and a Th2 intrahepatic immunological response. These features suggest that the liver lesion is due to a direct cytopathic injury caused by HCV.

To date, the absence of preventive strategy for HCV reinfection after transplant is a major challenge for the HCV recipients undergoing LT. As mentioned above, reinfection of the liver graft is universal and characterized by accelerated progression of liver disease. Furthermore, treatment of recurrent HCV infection after LT is compromised by enhanced adverse effects and limited efficacy of interferon-based therapies. In addition, poor outcome after graft reinfection of HCV has increasingly become a major problem faced by the hepatologists and transplant surgeons. Thus, novel preventive and therapeutic strategies of HCV reinfection are urgently needed.

Recurrence of HCV infection in the liver allograft is universal after LT, and its natural history is variable. It has been estimated that approximately 20% of recipients will progress to graft cirrhosis within 5 years of transplant [7] . Overall, HCV disease is more aggressive in the posttransplant recipients than in patients whose immunity is intact [8] . Accelerated disease progression is multifactorial and probably depends on a number of variables, including host, donor, viral, and external factors. However, the definite interactions between these factors and recurrent HCV infection in the liver allograft still remain controversial and poorly defined. Thus, to identify recipients at risk for rapid HCV recurrence after LT will be helpful especially when considering treatment with the currently available antiviral agents either as prophylaxis or therapy. To date, a number of risk factors have been mentioned regarding this clinical issue.

One study, reviewing 307 patients who underwent LT for HCV over a 10-year period, suggested that advanced donor age, prolonged donor hospitalization, increasing recipient age, and elevated recipient MELD scores were found to increase the relative risk of HCV recurrence [9] . Moreover, earlier studies have advocated that HCV recurrence may be more severe when older donors are used [10, 11] . In addition, the type of donor used may have an impact on HCV reinfection of the graft after LT. One clinical observation suggested that HCV recurrence is more severe in living donor LT compared to cadaveric LT [12] . However, another study reported that there are no differences observed in hepatitis C recurrence rate, severity of intrahepatic pathology, or graft and patient survival between living donor LT and cadaveric LT recipients [13] . As to the source of HCV reinfection in the allograft, it may occur at time of reperfusion intraoperatively [3] . The blood itself has a high probability to be the origin of this allograft reinfection [4] . It is indeed valuable that identifying these risk factors before LT, particularly when matching donors to HCV recipients, may decrease the incidence of HCV recurrence after LT.

Load. HCV infection of the allograft is believed to be an extremely dynamic process. HCV virus binds to the new allograft at the time of reperfusion, and viral replication occurs within hours after LT. The impact of recipients' viral load on HCV recurrence following LT is still uncertain, but a clear understanding of HCV kinetics after LT will contribute to the development of strategies to prevent HCV infection of the allograft. An earlier study, which analyzed HCV kinetics during and immediately after LT, found a sharp decrease in HCV viral load during the anhepatic phase and immediately after graft reperfusion [3] . This decrease was presumably attributed to massive binding of HCV to the hepatocytes. In other words, reinfection is immediate after reperfusion. Powers et al. also reported that HCV RNA levels dropped with an average half-life of 0.8 hours during the anhepatic phase [14] . The authors also mentioned that viral loads then continued to drop up to 23 hours after implantation, and began to rise as soon as 15 hours after the anhepatic phase. Moreover, the viral load reached a plateau before rising, suggesting that a nonhepatic source supplied virions and balanced their intrinsic clearance. It was estimated that nonhepatic sources were at most responsible for 4% of total viral production and the remaining 96% occurred in the liver.

Other similar studies pointed out that viral loads in serum returned to pretransplant levels within 24 to 48 hours after the procedure. Within weeks after transplant, viral loads would be approximately 1 log higher than pretransplant levels [4, 15] . However, studies investigating the impact of pretransplant viral load on the likelihood of HCV recurrence have produced controversial results. Several reports indicated that pretransplant viral load did not correlate with either the likelihood or timing of HCV recurrence following LT [16] . By contrast, one study including 166 HCV-infected recipients demonstrated that before transplant, HCV viral load greater than 1 million viral equivalents/mL was associated with decreased graft and patient survival [17] . Given the hypothesis that pretransplant treatment of HCV will reduce or prevent HCV posttransplant recurrence, it has been advocated that patients with HCV infection on the transplant list should be considered for therapy with the goal of obtaining sustained virological response (SVR) prior to LT [18] .

The influence of HCV genotypes on HCV recurrence after LT had been assessed, but the results were still controversial. Some studies demonstrated that the severity of recurrence and levels of viral replication for HCV hepatitis after LT were higher in patients with genotype 1b HCV infection than other genotypes [7, [19] [20] [21] . Another study by Gayowski et al. reported in their results that the rate of recurrent HCV hepatitis, timing to recurrence, severity of recurrence and response to IFN therapy did not differ among genotypes and suggested that HCV genotype may not be a significant factor influencing post-LT HCV hepatitis [22] .

Recently, genetic variation in the region of the IL28B gene on chromosome 19, coding for IFN-3, has been demonstrated to be strongly associated with SVR in patients with genotype 1 chronic HCV infection who are treated with pEG-IFN plus RBV in the nontransplant setting [23, 24] . IL28B polymorphism has also been associated with spontaneous HCV clearance [25] . One cohort study, Clinical and Developmental Immunology 3 which included 189 consecutive HCV patients undergoing LT, aimed to determine the prevalence and impact on clinical outcomes of donor and recipient IL28B genotypes among liver transplant recipients [26] . The authors suggested that recipient IL28B TT genotype is associated with more severe histological recurrence of HCV after LT and CC donor grafts might be preferentially allocated to recipients with HCV infection.

Reactivation of herpes group viruses may also be one of the factors associated with HCV recurrence after LT. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) are herpes viruses that commonly reactivate after transplantation. They are proposed to have an immunomodulatory effect in transplant recipients and may play a role in promoting HCV replication [27, 28] . Recently, a retrospective study of 347 first LT recipients (donor or recipient CMV seropositive) transplanted for HCV was performed to evaluate the associations of CMV infection and disease with recurrent hepatitis C after LT. It was found that CMV infection was associated with increased risk of fibrosis stage ≧2 and inflammation grade ≧2 [29] . However, their effects on posttransplant HCV recurrence still remain questionable. Data showed that short-term CMV viremia does not enhance the replication of HCV after LT [30] .

2.6. Immunosuppression. Early data, examining the pathogenesis of graft injury in liver transplant recipients with HCV infection, first reported that methylprednisolone treatment for acute rejection led to a 4-100-fold increase in serum HCV RNA [31] . Since then, an aggravated course of HCV reinfection after LT and increased resistance to antiviral therapy have been attributed to the application of specific immunosuppressive medication [32, 33] . Herein, various immunosuppression strategies have been evaluated for their influence on HCV recurrence.

Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids are often given as an induction protocol during LT, and low doses combined with other immunosuppressants are used as maintenance immunosuppression after operation. In case of acute rejection, recipients receive pulse methylprednisolone to reverse the rejection. There are convincing data that bolus doses of glucocorticoids given for rejection treatment have a negative impact on HCV recurrence. It is estimated that cumulative exposure to corticosteroids is associated with increased mortality, higher levels of HCV viremia, and more severe histological recurrence [34] . One recent study demonstrated that glucocorticosteroids specifically increased HCV entry by upregulating the cell entry factors occludin and scavenger receptor class B type I. The data suggested that the potential effects of high-dose glucocorticosteroids on HCV infection in vivo may be due to increased HCV dissemination [35] . Previous studies have indicated that the specific CD4 T cell response to HCV is important in viral clearance of acute HCV infection after liver transplantation. Moreover, plasmacytoid dendritic cells are capable of producing large amounts of IFN against HCV infection in this specific CD4 T cell response [36, 37] . Experimental data have shown that prednisolone suppressed the functions of plasmacytoid dendritic cells by promoting their apoptosis [38] . Thus, in a transplant setting, the consensus is that steroid avoidance or slow tapering of the dose is associated with reduced HCV recurrence [39, 40] , whereas boluses for treating acute rejection can increase the viral load [31] .

Calcineurin Inhibitors (CNIs). Cyclosporine is a lipophilic cyclic peptide of 11 amino acids, while tacrolimus is a macrolide antibiotic. Both drugs bind with high affinity to a family of cytoplasmic proteins (also called immunophilin), which present in a variety of immune cells. Immunophilindependent signal transduction via calcineurin represents a key event in the activation of T cell proliferation by regulating expression of the gene that encodes IL2. Cyclosporine A (CyA) binds to cyclophilin, while tacrolimus (Tac) binds to FK binding proteins (FKBPs). The binding blocks the phosphatase activity of calcineurin and subsequently inhibits TCR/CD3-induced T cell proliferation by the blockage of IL2 production. Intriguingly, in addition to their promoting role in calcineurin signalling, immunophilins are catalysts of protein folding and contribute to the invasion ability of several coronaviruses [41] . As to HCV, it is well established that cyclophilins have an important role in viral replication and de novo virus production. Recent data suggest that HCV replication is dependent on the interaction between cyclophilin B and nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B, HCV RNA polymerase) to stimulate its RNA binding activity and thereby promote the de novo synthesis of positive and negative stranded RNA [42] . Given the fact that immunophilins can work as a supportive role in viral infection, it is rational to find out that CyA is capable of the anti-HCV activity through mediating a specific blockade of cyclophilins to NS5B RNA [43] . As CyA interacts with both cyclophilin A and cyclophilin B, it is conceivable that CyA affects multiple steps in the life cycle of HCV. However, there is controversy about the anti-HCV effects of cyclosporine A in vivo. By contrast, Tac does not have any anti-HCV activity [44] .

MMF and MPA. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) belongs to the class of antimetabolite immunosuppressive agents. Mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active metabolite of MMF, is a selective noncompetitive inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). In addition to its potent immunosuppressive capacity, the in vitro assay has indicated that MPA has antiviral effect against HCV [45] . In HCV cell culture models, MPA could induce the expression of important antiviral interferon-stimulated genes, including interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 1, IRF 9, and interferoninduced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) [46] . Among these proteins, data showed that IRF1 was directly involved in the anti-HCV activity of MPA. Moreover, MPA could have effects in synergy with IFN-on HCV replication in the same HCV experiments. In addition, when combined with IFN-, MPA augmented the transcription of multiple interferon-stimulated genes. With the molecular basis of how MPA works in synergy with IFN , proper prospective clinical studies are warranted to confirm their synergistic effects against HCV in vivo. On the other hand, although the safety and efficacy of MMF as an immunosuppressive medication in HCV patients undergoing LT have been demonstrated, the exact effects on HCV recurrence have not been clearly studied.

Rapamycin. With low nephrotoxicity and potential anticancer properties, rapamycin has been increasingly used in the transplantation context [47] . It has been well known that rapamycin engages the cytosolic protein FKBP12 to form a complex. This complex inhibits the mTOR pathway by directly binding to the mTOR complex 1, resulting in blockage of cell cycle progression from the G1 to S phase and thereby causing inhibition of T cell proliferation. Intriguingly, rapamycin induces autophagy through inhibiting mTOR. Autophagy is a process for catabolizing organelles and other intracellular components to balance cellular metabolism and to promote cell survival during stressful conditions. In fact, autophagy is also an important event in the regulation of the cellular response against viral infections [48] . It is noteworthy that HCV infection induces autophagy in the hepatocytes via the unfolded protein response, and the autophagy induced by HCV is incomplete through blocking the maturation of autophagosomes to autolysosomes [49] . The autophagosomes will not be degraded but instead support viral replication. Recent study demonstrated that NS5B could directly interact with the host proteins to induce the autophagy [50] . In addition, the HCV-induced autophagy may promote infection by reducing the innate immunity [51] . Based on these findings, it is conceivable that rapamycin could affect HCV recurrence and antiviral interferon therapy. However, clinical evidence is needed to make sure of its in vivo effect.

HCV reinfection of the graft is almost universal among recipients with active infections at the time of transplantation [52] . An accelerated progression of fibrosis is noted in those recipients with recurrent HCV after transplant, and at least 25 to 30% of patients will eventually develop liver cirrhosis within 5 to 10 years [53, 54] . Once liver cirrhosis is established, the first episode of decompensation may occur in as high as 40% of patients within 1 year. Apart from the rapid progression of fibrosis, recipients with recurrent hepatitis C may also develop severe fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, characterized by jaundice, rapidly after organ transplantation in the absence of biliary obstruction causing a very high risk of graft failure [55] . For the reason, HCV-related recipients show a worse posttransplant outcome compared to HCV-negative recipients. A previous study which retrospectively analyzed 11036 patients with 11791 liver transplants confirmed that the HCV infection significantly impaired patient and graft survival after LT [56] . Focusing on the strategy to recurrent HCV infection after LT, three approaches have been identified according to the timing of treatment: pretransplantation antiviral therapy, posttransplantation prevention and preemptive treatment, and treatment for established reinfection. [58] . It is noteworthy that none of the patients who achieved SVR before LT developed graft reinfection in the study. In addition to the relative poor efficacy, safety of pegylated IFN is another concern in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Carrion et al. reported that 43%, 29%, and 8% of patients suffered from discontinuation, decompensation, and death during therapy [57] . Although the incidence of decompensation and death is similar in comparison to control group, treated patients suffered from a significantly higher rate of bacterial infection than control group. Child-Pugh B/C is the only independent factor associated with bacterial infection. These data suggested that patients with decompensated cirrhosis should be closely monitored during Pegylated IFN therapy and followed by experts with considerable experience. Direct acting antivirals (DAAs), including protease, polymerase or other nonstructural protein inhibitors, are the newly developed agents for HCV treatment. Current data on HCV treatment using DAA are limited in patients with cirrhosis. In the phase III trials with telaprevir and boceprevir, there were only a few patients with advanced fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis included [59] [60] [61] . Although the results from the phase III trials of telaprevir and boceprevir triple therapy showed a higher SVR rates compared to Pegylated IFN/RBV therapy in advanced fibrosis and cirrhotic patients, the severe advanced events rates were also increased in patients receiving triple therapy. The data from compassionate use of protease inhibitors in viral C cirrhosis (CUPIC) cohort also demonstrated an increased serious adverse events rates (from 30% to 51%) and discontinuation rates (from 7% to 12%) in cirrhotic nonresponders compared to the phase III trials. Another study in 20 cirrhotic patients awaiting LT demonstrated that 71% of patients achieved undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks with DAA triple therapy. However, 25% of patients suffered from early discontinuation, and 10% of patients had decompensation during therapy. The results suggest that triple therapy must be administered cautiously with intensive safety monitoring in cirrhotic patients.

Because of the accelerated clinical course of recurrent hepatitis C after LT, strategy to prevent reinfection of the graft is needed. Antihepatitis B immunoglobulin had been approved to successfully prevent HBV recurrence after LT. It is used in antibody therapy for HCV-infected recipients. However, recent studies using hepatitis C immunoglobulin or monoclonal antibody show only transient decrease of liver HCV RNA levels in liver transplant recipients [62, 63] . Preemptive or early posttransplant antiviral therapy aims to prevent the rapid development of chronic hepatitis before there is evidence of recurrent HCV infection. It is usually initiated within one month after LT. Compared to immunocompetent subjects, antiviral therapy response decreases during this period because of the high level of immunosuppression. A pilot study by Mazzaferro collected 36 HCV-RNA + cirrhotic patients who started a 12-month IFN plus RBV combination therapy within 3 weeks after LT [64] . The sustained virological response (SVR) was achieved in 33% of patients. None of the patients developed graft rejection, and normal histology was also noted in patients with SVR after a median followup of 52 months. However, higher than 26% of graft rejection was noted in another study using IFN and RBV combination therapy for more than 12 months [65] . Moreover, four other studies using different regiments, two IFN monotherapy and two pegylated-IFN monotherapy, showed a poor effect of less than 20% of SVR and a higher rate of treatment discontinuation and graft rejection [66] [67] [68] [69] . Therefore, more prospective and large-scaled studies are still needed to investigate the most appropriate regimen for Preemptive treatment.

Owing to relatively poor efficacy and high adverse effect, most experts now delay antiviral therapy till a histological evidence of recurrent HCV infection is established after LT. However, for patients diagnosed with fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, antiviral therapy must be given as early as possible after LT because of the poor short-term prognosis and rapid fibrosis progression. Initially, conventional IFN-based therapy was used to treat recurrent HCV infection after LT. A systematic review, consisted of 27 studies with a total of 689 patients, demonstrated a mean SVR rate of 24% with conventional IFN-based therapy [70] . Compared to conventional IFN-based therapy, pegylated IFNbased therapy showed a significant improvement of SVR rate. Three recent systematic reviews demonstrated 20-40% of SVR rate in genotype 1 and 50-100% in genotype 2/3 subjects using Pegylated IFN-based therapy for recurrent hepatitis C after LT [71] [72] [73] . The same result is also found in the histological improvement, regardless of necroinflammation or fibrosis. The factors to predict a better SVR are also the same as in nontransplant patients. Genotype non-1, low pretreatment HCV RNA, rapid virological response, and adherence to therapy have been identified as the positive predictors [70] [71] [72] . The association between response and recipient/donor liver IL-28B genotype is also reported recently [26, 74] . Charlton [26] . Fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis is another poor predictor, and it is almost incurable with IFN treatment when fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis develops [75] . Safety and tolerance for therapy are also among the major concern in LT recipients with HCV recurrence. Dose reduction, discontinuation, and acute rejection were noted in 44% (38-50%), 24% (21-27%), and 2% (1-3%) of patients treated with conventional IFNbased therapy [70] . For the patients treated with Pegylated IFN therapy, a better SVR rate was noted in comparison to the IFN-based group. Meanwhile, the rejection rate was also found to be elevated with a mean rate of 5-10% (highest 25%). In addition, dose reduction was noted in over 50% of patients, and treatment discontinuation was found in around 30% of patients [70] [71] [72] .

In treatment of genotype 1 HCV infection, the first generation of DAAs, telaprevir and boceprevir were recently used to enhance the efficacy of the standard regiment, Pegylated IFN plus RBV [76] . Although DAAs significantly increase the SVR rate in naïve patients, relapsers, and nonresponders [59] [60] [61] , evidence is still limited about their efficacy in recurrent HCV infection after LT. In addition, there are some limitations for safety and tolerance. One critical limitation is the potential interaction with CNI. One recent study in healthy volunteers showed that boceprevir increased the area under the curve of CsA and Tac by 2.7 and of 17, respectively, [77] . Another study reported that the concomitant administration of immunosuppressive therapy with telaprevir in healthy volunteers increased CsA and Tac exposures by approximately 4.6-fold and 70-fold, respectively [78] . In 2012, several teams have communicated preliminary results of DAAs use after LT, which are summarized by Coilly et al. [79] . Overall, at 12 weeks of triple therapy, a complete early virological response (EVR) was obtained in 71% of patients treated with boceprevir and in 73% of patients treated with telaprevir. Notably, the CsA dose should be reduced by 1.3-fold with boceprevir and fourfold with telaprevir. The Tac dose should be reduced by fivefold with boceprevir and 35-fold with telaprevir. It was concluded that DAAs could completely change the prognosis of patients with severe HCV recurrence and offer new perspectives for the treatment of HCV recurrence in liver transplant patients.

The current therapy against HCV infection, consisting of a combination of pegylated interferon (IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), is limited by resistance, adverse effects, and high costs. The absence of preventive regiment is a major limitation for patients undergoing LT for HCV-related liver failure. Moreover, accelerated progression to liver cirrhosis after graft reinfection and limited efficacy of IFN-based therapies for recurrent HCV are two major clinical issues leading to poor posttransplant outcome of the HCV recipients [80] . Thus, novel preventive and therapeutic antivirals are urgently needed. Viral entry is required for initiation, spread, and maintenance of infection. HCV entry is a multistep process orchestrated by a number of viral and host cell factors.

These factors include the viral envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2, CD81, scavenger receptor B1, and tight junction proteins claudin-1 and occluding. A clear understanding of the detailed mechanisms of HCV entry may shed light in the ways to prevent the liver graft from HCV recurrence.

Cells through E2. Humoral responses are often thought to play a key role in controlling HCV infection [81] . In clinical setting, patients spontaneously resolving from acute HCV infection tend to have an early induction of neutralizing antibody response. In contrast, chronic infection patients have a delayed initiation of neutralizing antibody response. Moreover, the variety of strategies the virus evolves to escape antibodies-mediated neutralization, including the accelerated evolution and the diversity of HCV [82] . Overall, the capacity of HCV to mutate continuously allows a high plasticity and an ability of the virus to adapt to variable environmental conditions and escape the host's immune responses leading to HCV persistene. HCV entry to the hepatocytes requires interaction of its viral envelope glycoproteins (E1 and E2) and the cell membrane [83] . Both E1 and E2 contain putative fusion domains [84] . While little is known about the role of E1 in HCV entry, several domains in E2 have been defined to bind to CD 81 and scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), two important host factors (described in the next paragraph). These interactions through E2 glycoprotein help HCV evade host immune responses and enter the hepatocytes. For example, hypervariate region 1 (HVR1), the first 27 amino acids of E2, plays an important role in viral fitness. It has been demonstrated that HVR1 was involved in SR-BI-mediated HCV entry [85] . Therefore, HVR1 has been suggested to be a target for neutralizing antibodies, but its high variability results in poor crossneutralization potency of antibodies across different HCV isolates [86] . It is well known that host humoral responses are thought to play a critical role in controlling HCV infection. Several studies reported that broadly neutralizing antibodies might be directed against conserved conformational epitopes within E2 and mostly inhibit E2-CD81 interaction [87, 88] . Currently, new conformational and conserved epitopes have been identified in the N-terminal part of E2 [89] . The conserved nature of these epitopes holds great promise for the development of potent inhibitors for HCV entry.

Several cell surface molecules of the target cells have been identified to interact with HCV, including CD81, the LDL receptor, highly sulfated heparan sulfate (HS), SR-BI, and claudin-1 (CLDN1), occludin (OCLN).

Cd81, a ubiquitously expressed 25 kDa tetraspanin, has been demonstrated to interact with the soluble truncated form of HCV E2 [89] . Its large extracellular loop (LEL) seems to play a critical role in this interaction process. Moreover, studies have identified several amino acid residues throughout the CD81 LEL and HCV E2, which might be crucial for E2-CD81 binding [90, 91] . SR-BI, an 82 kDa glycoprotein with a large extracellular loop, is highly expressed in the liver [92] .

Physiologically, SR-BI binds a variety of lipoproteins (e.g., HDL and LDL) and is involved in bidirectional cholesterol transport at the cell membrane. The LEL of SR-BI has been demonstrated to interact with E2 HVR1 [93] . Recent studies suggest that the interplay between lipoproteins, SR-BI, and HCV envelope glycoproteins is required for HCV entry [94, 95] . CLDNs are critical components of tight junctions, which regulate paracellular permeability and polarity. CLDN1, a 23 kDa four-transmembrane protein, is predominantly expressed in the liver [96] . Intriguingly, CLDN1 may localize to the tight junction and the basolateral surfaces of hepatocytes [97] . Recent studies suggest that nonjunctional CLDN1 may be also involved in HCV entry [48, 98] . OCLN is a 65 kDa four transmembrane protein expressed in the tight junction of polarized cells. Several studies have shown that OCLN is probably involved in the late postbinding event of HCV entry [99, 100] . As HCV circulates in the blood in association with LDL and VLDL, the LDL receptor has also been proposed as an attachment and/or entry factor for HCV [100] . The LDLR has been shown to mediate the internalization of serum-derived HCV into CD81-deficient HepG2 cells by binding virus-LDL particles [101] . Since cholesterol has been shown to be necessary for HCV cell entry, it is rational that other cholesterol-uptake receptors might also have a role in this process. More recently, Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 cholesterol absorption receptor (NPC1L1), a 13-transmembranedomain cell surface cholesterol-sensing receptor, has been demonstrated as a new HCV entry factor [102] .

Using a functional RNAi kinase screen, recent study identified epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ephrin receptor A2 (EPHA2), two receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) which regulate a number of key cellular functions, as host factors for HCV entry [103] . The results showed that the identified RTKs mediated HCV entry by regulating CD81claudin-1 coreceptor associations and viral glycoproteindependent membrane fusion, implying that inhibition of RTK function may constitute a new approach for the prevention and treatment of HCV infection.

process. This process is tightly orchestrated by several viral and host factors. In brief, HCV is believed to first interact with HS and LDLR on the membrane surface of hepatocytes to allow concentration of the virion. Subsequently, interaction with other host factors such as SR-BI, CD81, CLDN1, and OCLN ultimately leads to viral internalization via the socalled clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Fusion between viral and endosomal membranes is followed by release of the viral genome into the cytosol, where translation and replication take place. Finally, HCV particles are assembled and released from the hepatocytes.

Recently, accumulated data have tried to unravel the potential molecular mechanisms of HCV entry. Some fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies described the critical role of the association between CD81 and CLDN1 coreceptors in HCV entry [104, 105] . Next, a rate-limiting role for SR-BI in HCV infection has been reported [106] . The in vitro study demonstrated that increased SR-BI expression would enhance entry and internalization of HCV. Several studies investigating the postbinding cellular mechanisms found that the ability of HCV penetration into the hepatocytes may depend on clathrin-mediated endocytosis [107, 108] . After internalization, fusion occurs between viral and endosomal membranes. Recent assay further showed that the fusion may be low of pH and temperature dependent and facilitated by cholesterol [109, 110] . Although the detailed molecular mechanism of HCV entry still needs more investigations, it is conceivable that HCV internalization and fusion may offer many targets for the development of HCV entry inhibitors.

Interfering with HCV entry into the hepatocytes holds great promises for the development of novel drugs. Several potential targets are suggested: (1) blocking virus-target cell interaction during attachment and binding; (2) interfering with postbinding events and (3) interfering with viral fusion. Various modalities may be adopted as HCV entry inhibitors: neutralizing antibodies for HCV envelope glycoproteins, blocking antibodies specific for host factors, and small molecular compounds against host factors or viral proteins.

CD81 is one of these potential targets. Imidazole-based compounds mimicking an alpha helix in the LEL of CD81 compete for HCV E2-CD81 binding [111] . These drugs bind E2 in a reversible manner and block E2-CD81 interaction while having no effect neither on CD81 expression nor on CD81 interaction with physiological partner molecules. In addition, recent study demonstrated that anti-CD81 antibodies completely protected human liver-uPA-SCID mice from a subsequent challenge with HCV consensus strains of different genotypes [112] . However, administration of anti-CD81 antibodies after viral challenge had no effect. Anti-SR-BI antibodies, which block the interaction of SR-BI with HCV, are another interesting strategy to prevent HCV entry. Anti-SR-BI antibodies have been demonstrated to inhibit HCVcc infection in vitro [113] . Moreover, small molecule inhibitors of SR-BI have recently been developed. For example, ITX5061 is a compound that inhibits entry of HCVpp from all major genotypes and HCVcc infection without affecting viral replication [114] . In addition, recent study demonstrated that a human monoclonal antibody targeting SR-BI efficiently precluded HCV infection and viral spread after LT in vitro and in vivo [115] . Kinetic studies suggest that this small molecule inhibitor targets HCV entry during an early postbinding stage. CLDN1 has been suggested to play an important role in cell-cell transmission. Recently, anti-CLDN1 antibodies inhibiting HCV infection in vitro have been developed [116] . The results have shown that anti-CLDN1 antibodies efficiently block cell entry of highly infectious escape variants of HCV that are resistant to host neutralizing antibodies. As mentioned above, EGFR and EphA2 are two newly established host factors for HCV entry. Thus, their respective inhibitors, erlotinib and dasatinib, are also regarded as promising HCV inhibitors in preventing HCV reinfection after LT [103] .

In addition to cell surface expressed host factors, HCV internalization and fusion are complex processes that also offer several targets for antivirals. A recent study demonstrated that long phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (PS-ON) inhibited HCV internalization without affecting viral binding and replication [117] . The human liver-chimeric Alb-uPA/SCID mouse model also showed that PS-ON block de novo HCV infection. These data shed light on the promise of PS-ON as future clinical solution.

Recurrent HCV infection after liver transplantation has increasingly become a major clinical issue that the hepatologist and transplant surgeons should face. During the past decade, numerous therapeutic approaches based on both basic research and clinical evidences have been reported, but the effective strategy still needs more efforts to be approved. Meanwhile, many critical questions remain in several aspects of HCV, including the viral infection cycle activities, the detailed structure, composition, and function of the HCV virion in host cells. In addition, current standard of therapeutic formula consisting of Pegylated IFN combined with ribavirin and an NS3/4A inhibitor is ineffective or only partially effective. In fact, as reviewed in this paper, many novel inhibitors or neutralizing antibodies targeting HCV proteins and host factors hold promise to effectively prevent or treat HCV. Hopefully, these future strategies will improve the overall outcome of HCV recipients after liver transplantation [101] .

Case Report Megapneumonia Coinfection: pneumococcus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Metapneumovirus

We report a young girl who died of Streptococcus pneumoniae 19A pneumonia, septic shock, and hemolytic uremic syndrome despite prior pneumococcal vaccination, appropriate antibiotics, and aggressive intensive care support. Serotype 19A is not covered by the 7-or 10-valent pneumococcal vaccines. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and metapneumovirus were simultaneously detected by PCR in the nasopharyngeal and tracheal aspirates. The pneumococcus is penicillin sensitive. Although infections with each of these pathogens alone are typically mild, this case highlights that co-infection with the triple respiratory pathogens possibly contributed to the fatal outcome of this child. Also, the new policy in Hong Kong to use PCV13 may help prevent further cases of serotype 19A infections.

A previously healthy 4-year-old girl became dyspneic and critically ill with pneumonia and multiorgan system failure. She had been febrile with chills for 4 days (39 • C), breathless and coughing for 2 days. She had visited the general practitioners twice, and treated symptomatically but with no antibiotic prescription. She had vomited and passed watery stool. Her immunizations were up-to-date and she received one dose of 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine at age 2 years. The young brother had recovered from a recent febrile coughing episode. Because of increasing shortness of breath, the mother took her to the emergency department. Her vitals were: heart rate 165/min, respiratory rate 30/min, tympanic temperature 36.7 • C, SaO 2 79% in room air, and decreased air entry to right lung. Supplemental oxygen of 6 liter/min was immediately given. Chest radiography showed right sided pneumonia with pleural effusion (Figure 1 ).

On admission to the pediatric ward, temperature was 36.9 • C, pulse 125/min, respiratory rate 46/min, blood pressure 94/52 mmHg, and SaO 2 95% with 100% oxygen. Shortly, the patient became lethargic with cold peripheries, cyanosis, and insucking chest. She was given normal saline boluses and dobutamine (10 mcg/kg/min) and promptly transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). There, she received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (13 minutes) because of cardiopulmonary failure, septic shock, and bradycardia. She was ventilated and treated with intravenous cefotaxime, high dose ampicillin, vancomycin, clarithromycin, packed cell, fresh frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate transfusions. Abnormal laboratory findings included hemoglobulin 8.0 g/dL, platelets 87 × 10 9 /L, and white cell count 1 × 10 9 /L; activated partial thromboplastin time APTT was 47.9 seconds, prothrombin time PT 13.4 seconds, d-dimer 2192 ng/mL, C-reactive protein 51.9 mg/L, plasma urea 18.2 mmol/L, creatinine 214 umol/L. Her lowest PaO 2 /FiO 2 was 42, and arterio-alveolar gradient 610 mmHg. Echocardiography showed reduced cardiac contractility (ejection fraction 48%) but no pericardial effusion. The pleural effusion was drained, and 40 mL of dark turbid fluid 2 Case Reports in Medicine yielded (Figure 1 insert). Despite multiple inotrope infusions of dobutamine, adrenaline, noradrenaline, and milrinone, her mean blood pressure remained low (50 mmHg) and she suffered another episode of cardiac arrest 9 hours following admission. Hemodiafiltration was instituted for intractable septic shock, renal failure, acidosis, and fluid retention. The patient ran a deteriorating course despite aggressive ICU support. She developed another episode of cardiac arrest and succumbed 39 hours following hospitalization. Nasopharyngeal and tracheal aspirates yielded Mycoplasma pneumoniae (by polymerase chain reaction PCR) and human Metapneumovirus RNA (by RT-PCR). Blood culture, pleural fluid, and tracheal aspirate yielded leucocytes and Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotype 19A) sensitive to cefotaxime and penicillin. CSF was not obtained during the critical episode.

Postmortem examination confirmed generalized necrotizing pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage and right middle lobe hemorrhagic infarct. The proximal tubules of both kidneys showed acute tubular necrosis but no microangiopathic thrombosis. Histology of the heart and the brain was unremarkable. Tissue cultures were negative.

Pneumococcus is an important pathogen in childhood [1] [2] [3] . Invasive pneumococcal disease refers to unlocalised bacteremia, pneumonia, or meningitis. Despite the availability of effective vaccines, new serotypes continue to evolve [1] [2] [3] . The Hong Kong Government introduced the 7-valent polysaccharide vaccine in September 2009. In 2010, the vaccine was changed to the 10-valent vaccine and in 2011 recommendation was made to switch to a 13-valent vaccine.

Locally, the coverage of the 7-valent or 10-valent and 13valent vaccines was 65% and 90%, respectively [2] . The parents reported that the child received one prior dose of 7-valent vaccine before 3 years of age in early 2010. It is possible that 19A was a commonly circulating strain before the introduction of the 10-valent or 13-valent vaccines. The 13-valent vaccine should stop circulation of 19A when the program is fully implemented.

History of immunization with the 7-valent vaccine is not a guaranteed prevention against pneumococcal infection in children [1] [2] [3] . Evolving serotypes associated with severe lobar pneumonia, pleural effusion, and PICU admission despite prior immunization have been previously reported locally [4] .

Evidenced-based guidelines for management of infants and children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) were prepared by an expert panel comprising clinicians and investigators representing community pediatrics, public health, and the pediatric specialties of critical care, emergency medicine, hospital medicine, infectious diseases, pulmonology, and surgery [5] . Amoxicillin should be used as first-line therapy for previously healthy, appropriately immunized infants and preschool-aged children with mild to moderate CAP suspected to be of bacterial origin. Amoxicillin provides appropriate coverage for S. pneumoniae, the most prominent invasive bacterial pathogen. Macrolide antibiotics should be prescribed for treatment of children (primarily school-aged children and adolescents) evaluated in an outpatient setting with findings compatible with CAP caused by atypical pathogens. Laboratory testing for M. pneumoniae should be performed if available in a clinically relevant time frame. Ampicillin or penicillin G should be administered to the fully immunized infant or school-aged child admitted to a hospital ward with CAP when local epidemiologic data document lack of substantial high-level penicillin resistance for invasive S. pneumoniae. Empiric therapy with a third-generation parenteral cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) should be prescribed for hospitalized infants and children who are not fully immunized, in regions where local epidemiology of invasive pneumococcal strains documents high-level penicillin resistance, or for infants and children with life-threatening infection, including empyema. Empiric combination therapy with a macrolide (oral or parenteral), in addition to a beta-lactam antibiotic, should be prescribed for the hospitalized child for whom M. pneumonia and C. pneumoniae are significant considerations; diagnostic testing should be performed if available in a clinically relevant time frame. Accordingly, earlier initiation of antibiotics might have increased the chances of survival in this child.

Antibiotic resistance has also developed in Hong Kong [1, 2] . The serotype 19A is especially virulent and may be difficult to isolate in patients who have already been started on antibiotics. The pathogen has been reported to be associated with the hemolytic uremic syndrome [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Penicillin can be used in sensitive pneumococcus [1, 2] . In patient with pneumonia not responding satisfactory initially, more invasive investigative/therapeutic management including a pleural drain for biologic specimen is indicated to guide management. Local antimicrobial sensitivity in PICU patients has been reported [1, 2] . The pathogen was sensitive to penicillin and cefotaxime in this case. In patients not responding satisfactorily with initial antibiotics but with known penicillin sensitivity, a higher dose of penicillin should be tried.

Coinfections by viral and bacterial agents in critically ill patients have been reported [12] [13] [14] [15] . Mycoplasma pneumoniae usually affects older children and a clinical entity of atypical pneumonia or "walking" pneumonia. Metapneumovirus usually causes co-infection [13] . Occasionally, both pathogens can cause severe acute respiratory symptoms just like SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) [16] .

In-house real-time RT-PCRs were performed according to hospital laboratory standard operating procedures for the qualitative detection of human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) RNA and of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP). The target of amplification for hMPV was the nucleoprotein gene (N gene) with primer sequences and method as described by Hopkins et al. and 45 cycles were run on real-time PCR (ABI prism 7900 HT FAST) [17] . Positive and negative controls were included, and a Ct value of ≤37 was considered positive. The target of amplification for MP was the ADPribosylating toxin gene encoding the CARDS (communityacquired respiratory distress syndrome) toxin using primer pairs and method as described by Winchell et al. [18] . Both internal DNA control and a positive and negative control were included in the reaction run. A Ct value ≤34 was considered positive.

It is difficult to ascertain if Metapneumovirus and Mycoplasma had contributed to this fatal illness. These pathogens were detected in the tracheal and the nasopharyngeal aspirates but not in the postmortem lung tissue cultures.

Unlike the nasopharynx, the presence of any pathogens in the tracheal aspirates represents infection in the lower respiratory tract rather than carriage in the upper airway. Both pathogens are known to cause pneumonia on their own and both are not commonly carried by healthy young persons [5, 13, [19] [20] [21] [22] . These facts support the argument that they were copathogens with pneumococcus which was found in pleural fluid, tracheal aspirates, and blood. In conclusion, the simultaneous isolations of 3 respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens have not been reported in our locality and may contribute to the fatal outcome of this unfortunate child.

BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making Modeling and detection of respiratory-related outbreak signatures

Background: Time series methods are commonly used to detect disease outbreak signatures (e.g., signals due to influenza outbreaks and anthrax attacks) from varying respiratory-related diagnostic or syndromic data sources. Typically this involves two components: (i) Using time series methods to model the baseline background distribution (the time series process that is assumed to contain no outbreak signatures), (ii) Detecting outbreak signatures using filter-based time series methods.

We consider time series models for chest radiograph data obtained from Midwest children's emergency departments. These models incorporate available covariate information such as patient visit counts and smoothed ambient temperature series, as well as time series dependencies on daily and weekly seasonal scales. Respiratory-related outbreak signature detection is based on filtering the one-step-ahead prediction errors obtained from the time series models for the respiratory-complaint background.

Using simulation experiments based on a stochastic model for an anthrax attack, we illustrate the effect of the choice of filter and the statistical models upon radiograph-attributed outbreak signature detection.

We demonstrate the importance of using seasonal autoregressive integrated average time series models (SARIMA) with covariates in the modeling of respiratory-related time series data. We find some homogeneity in the time series models for the respiratory-complaint backgrounds across the Midwest emergency departments studied. Our simulations show that the balance between specificity, sensitivity, and timeliness to detect an outbreak signature differs by the emergency department and the choice of filter. The linear and exponential filters provide a good balance.

Well-known, as well as previously uncharacterized infections continue to (re)emerge around the globe. To avoid casualties from outbreaks of these infections and from the potential criminal uses of bioagents, surveillance systems are needed that have the capacity to identify such outbreaks accurately and rapidly. The accuracy and timeliness of biosurveillance systems rests on the ability to model the uncertainty, severity, and aberrancy of clinical symptoms that are likely to portend disease outbreaks as expressed through the data monitoring system. Shmueli [1] summarizes the problems that biosurveillance systems, in general, pose to traditional statistical monitoring: (a) biosurveillance data may not be independent or stationary; (b) non-traditional data are assumed to contain earlier signature of an outbreak but this signal is weaker compared to actual diagnosis data; (c) since there are no data that contain bioterrorist outbreaks, outbreak patterns particularly as they would manifest in non-traditional data streams are unknown; (d) biosurveillance data are assumed to have no bioterrorist outbreaks, but the natural outbreaks add up to the background noise.

The key issue at hand is to design statistical modeling and detection methods that can address these problems.

Among children, respiratory symptoms are an attractive target for surveillance. These are a prominent feature of many childhood epidemics and an early presentation of diseases like avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and inhalational anthrax that have recently come to the public's attention. Unfortunately, respiratory complaints are also a feature of many common childhood illnesses, reducing the ability of biosurveillance systems to detect epidemics of greater public health concern. What is needed, therefore, is clinical information that is readily accessible and pre-processed in a manner that reflects the severity and aberrancy of respiratory symptoms. Using such data, discrimination between common childhood diseases and more serious respiratory epidemics would be possible.

Chest radiographs (X-rays), because they are readily available and are generally ordered by clinicians to evaluate respiratory complaints that are atypical or severe, have the potential to act as such a bio-monitoring and validation tool. In addition, detection based on models of radiograph ordering can indicate when in-depth follow-up is needed, as may occur when ordering of radiographs by clinicians is excessive for a given time of the year. Such indepth review of radiographs may confirm clinical suspicions of an emerging epidemic or signal the need to perform a targeted review of medical charts to identify anomalous findings or groupings of aberrant findings that might herald the early stages of a respiratory-related outbreak.

In this article we consider time series methods for the modeling and detection of respiratory-related outbreak signatures based on chest radiograph ordering patterns from a number of pediatric emergency departments (EDs) located in the Midwestern region of the United States.

These models include ambient temperature records collected in each city, as a covariate. We use the temperature series as a surrogate measure of the annual influenza season. Also, a patient visit count series is included in the models to account for variations between-EDs (like ED sizes) and within-EDs (day-of-week, for example). Addressing the fact that the underlying process is neither "independent or stationary", our interest is to model the underlying "respiratory-complaint background", using the available covariates and significant temporal dependencies present in the data. Without modeling the spatial dependence directly, we investigate whether or not there is evidence of spatial homogeneity in the statistical models across cities. We use filter-based prediction methods to indicate evidence of respiratory-related outbreaks (e.g., due to anthrax attack) using chest radiograph data. We describe the form and function of various filters that are commonly used to detect outbreak signatures. Using a stochastic model for an anthrax attack, we assess the performance of these methods. Since there are no data that contain outbreak patterns, the use of a model is key to providing realistic outbreak patterns that can accurately be used to evaluate these statistical detection methods.

Reis, Mandl, and others use time series methods to detect evidence of disease outbreaks at Boston Children's Hospital [2] [3] [4] , modeling specific clinical complaints as deterministic trend and seasonalities plus a stationary autoregressive moving average (ARMA) process. They repeat this process for the visit counts instead of considering a joint modeling procedure. The detection algorithm filters one-step-ahead prediction errors [5] , and looks for values in this residual process that exceed a predetermined threshold. Their simulations are based on less realistic deterministic outbreak models. Ivanov, et al. [6] use the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average smoother to measure timeliness, sensitivity, and specificity of free-text chief complaints (information describing patient's status on the ED visit). They indicate that the methods are good for detecting relatively large seasonal outbreaks, but not for small outbreaks. Burkom, et al. [7] extend this approach using Bayes Belief Networks to improve detection sensitivity and timeliness. There are also a number of wavelet-based and smoothing-based methods that can be used to monitor and detect abnormalities of unknown form, occurring over different time scales [1, 8, 9] . The use of scan statistics [10] [11] [12] has also gained popularity in recent years. Many of the methods based on scan statistics use fixed-effect models for biosurveillance (also see, e.g., [13] and [14] for other methods based on fixed-effect models).

Our manuscript is organized as follows: we start by summarizing the data of interest, and propose a statistical model for the ED data in each city. Using the growing lit-erature on the subject, we outline a stochastic model for an anthrax outbreak along with a healthcare utilization model for simulating people entering the ED. We then describe the methodology and theory for detecting unexpected outbreak signatures in time series sources using filters. We examine the form and function of the filters used for detection. In the results section, we explore the time series models obtained for each Midwest ED included in our study. We assess these detection methods using a simulated anthrax attack, and we end with a discussion.

The data of interest consist of daily counts of ED visits and chest radiographs taken between January 1st, 2003 and September 9th, 2004, in five metropolitan children's hospitals in the Midwest of the USA (Minneapolis/St. Paul, Milwaukee, Chicago, Akron, and Columbus), supplemented with time series of daily average temperature, obtained from the Average Daily Temperature Archive at The University of Dayton [15] . These series are shown in Figure 1 . There seems to be strong seasonal component in the chest radiograph and visit series, for all the cities, which is negatively correlated with temperature. Although it could be argued that we do not have enough years of data to prove this empirically, it is expected that a higher number of respiratory complaints is associated with colder temperatures.

We now discuss two aspects of the statistical model for these daily chest radiograph counts: distribution and scale. Although the outcome variable of interest is counts, like other researchers in the field [1] [2] [3] [4] [6] [7] [8] [9] , we model the data using a Gaussian rather than Poisson process. The reasons are: (i) A normal approximation to the Poisson random variable is reasonable when the mean number of radiograph counts is large, as in this study; (ii) Gaussian time series models are easier to fit, diagnose, and interpret; (iii) The theory for filter-based methods commonly used for detecting the outbreak signature in such data is well developed for Gaussian processes. In some applications, count data are transformed when Gaussian models are used. Transformations, such as log or square root, are used to parameterize multiplicative models or to stabilize the variance. We use the original scale instead of transforming the data, like other researchers in the area, for ease of interpretation. This is especially important when we analyze filter-based detection methods in this article. For the same reason, we do not model the number of chest radiographs per daily ED visits (i.e., the proportion of radiographs). The filter-based theory, allows us to directly assess the effect of additive stochastic outbreaks signatures upon the radiograph series.

In our study, the first ten months of data (Jan to Oct, 2003) were used as the training set, while the remaining ten months (Nov, 2003 to Sep, 2004 were used, as a test dataset, to evaluate the model and detection methods.

Since the goal is to predict the number of chest radiographs, for each city we fit a linear time series regression model, using the number of chest radiographs as the response, and the number of visits and temperature as predictor variables. We smooth the temperature series, because we believe that long-range temporal trends are more predictive of chest radiograph counts. Let {R k,t } denote the number of chest radiographs for the ED in city k (k = 1, 2, ..., 5) on day t and let

Here {V k,t } are the visit counts for city k and {T k,t } is the smoothed time series of temperatures for city k, filtered by taking a thirty day moving average to remove intra-month variation. To complete the model we assume that {X k,t } is a zero mean stationary time series (we discuss the consequences of this assumption in the Discussion), that we shall represent using a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average process (SARIMA). The SARIMA model (defined in the Appendix) allows for simultaneous modeling of dependencies on both the day as well as the weekly seasonal scales. To aid in the comparison of the dependencies across cities, the order of the time series model, as determined by choosing the autoregressive (p k and P k ) and moving average orders (q k and Q k ), will be the same for each city k.

We now propose a simple stochastic model for an inhalational anthrax outbreak, based on the work of Buckeridge, et al. and Brookmeyer et al. [16, 17] . As proposed by these authors, our model incorporates two elements: Any inhalational anthrax outbreak starts with the dispersion of the anthrax spores. Once spores are inhaled by a subject, in the incubation stage spores either germinate or are cleared out the lung. For the spores that germinate during incubation, the later stages of the disease are the prodromal and fulminant stages, followed by death. Buckeridge, et al. [16] model the spread of spores over a grid covering the Norfolk, Virginia region using a Gaussian plume model. Their model considers the source and Time series plots strength of the anthrax attack, along with prevalent wind directions.

Instead of using the region-based approach of Buckeridge, et al., we use the individual-based infection scheme of Brookmeyer, et al. [17] . Although it is known that anthrax spores can survive for long periods of time in the environment, we consider a small scale scenario. Since the population of interest is the individuals attending children's emergency departments, we assume an outbreak that affects a fixed number, N say, of children. Brookmeyer, et al. [17] define the infection probability of an individual exposed to inhalational anthrax using a competing risk model, modeling the dynamics of spore clearance and germination. Let θ represent the hazard rate per unit time (days, say) that a spore is cleared from the lung and λ be the rate of germination. Suppose that each individual inhales a dose of D spores. Then, the probability that at least one spore germinates is called the attack rate (AR) and is calculated using a Poisson approximation, as

For a given attack rate, the probability that at least one of the D spores germinates within t days is given by

Note that the limit, lim t → ∞ F(t) = AR. Based on a statistical analysis of an anthrax outbreak that occurred in Sverdlovsk, Russia, Brookmeyer, et al. [17] estimate hazard rates of between 0.05 and 0.11 for θ (which is compatible with θ = 0.07 obtained from animal studies for an AR of 0.5). The value of λ is not estimated in their data analysis -based on animal studies they found that the rate λ lies between 5 × 10 -7 and 10 -5 . Buckeridge, et al. [16] propose log normal models for the duration of the prodromal and fulminant stages, based on the 2001 anthrax attack in the United States. The median duration of the prodromal stage was 12.18 days, with a dispersion of 1.41, and the median duration of the fulminant stage was 1.5 days with a dispersion again of 1.41.

Next, we describe a simplified health-utilization model for people entering the ED, based on ideas discussed in [16] . During the incubation stage, we assume that no infected people enter the ED. Non-infected people that enter the ED for other chest problems are part of the background data. During the prodromal and fulminant stages we assume a simple Markov model of utilization: each infected subject is a Bernoulli event, independent across days. At the prodromal stage people enter the ED with probability P d on a weekday and P w on weekends. At the fulminant stage the probability of entering the ED, P f say, is larger than the probabilities in the prodromal stage. The reason is that at the fulminant stage, the anthrax symptoms are similar to those of a heart attack and therefore people enter the ED with higher probability. The differentiation between weekday and weekend is irrelevant at this stage. We suppose that a small percentage of people in the prodromal or fulminant stages are misdiagnosed and thus need to re-enter the system. Also, we assume that people can potentially be misdiagnosed a maximum of two times during the same attack (10% in the first visit and 5% in the second visit). The probabilities of entering the ED after being misdiagnosed are increased by an additive factor, C, for every additional entry. Our model allows for a small probability of drop-out, to account for other ways of leaving the system (e.g., pharmacy visit). The health-utilization model could easily be extended to include, e.g., varying probabilities of entering the ED by stage/time, and/or more advanced ways to exit the system.

The main idea of filter-based methods is to create a detection process {D k,t }, for each time point t, which is a weighted average of the diagnostic or syndromic data to be used for the detection of an outbreak signature. The weights that appear in {D k,t } are defined using the form of the time series model and a filter, {a l } say. Extreme positive values of the detection process at a time point indicate a possible outbreak signature. The definition of the detection processes has its origin in process control [5] , and is popularly used in the context of biosurveillance [1] [2] [3] [4] 6, 8] . Naturally, the form of the filter has an important effect in the detection process.

A common parametric approach that we follow in this study is to first obtain the residual process by subtracting off the non-stationary part of the model (i.e., the effect of the covariates). We then define the filter {c k,j }, that first decorrelates (whitens) this residual process using the onestep-ahead prediction errors and second filters this whitened series using {a l } to yield the detection process {D k,t }.

Commonly used examples of the filter {a l } include the differencing, moving average, or exponential filter. For a fixed value of α, let 1 -α denote the specificity (the probability of no detection, when there is no actual outbreak signature). We declare evidence of an outbreak signature at time t if the detection process at that time point, D k,t , exceeds a threshold τ k,α , calculated using the data or the process. Further details are given in the Appendix. Filter plots Figure 2 Filter plots. Plots of the four filters {f k, l } that can be used to calculate the detection process D k, t for the Columbus series. The number in parentheses after the filter name is τ k, α , calculated using a normal approximation. 2. When {a l } is the 7-day filter, {f k,l } is a weighted average of the last 7 days (with most weight on the current day), minus a weighted decaying average of the remaining past days. The weekly seasonal terms are not as strong, compared to the filter that is the convolution of the 1-day filter.

3. When {a l } is the linear filter, {f k,l } is an average of 6 days in the past. Far more weight is put on the current day relative to the previous 6 days. From this we subtract an average of values previous to the 6 days. Most of the weight from the second average comes from around days 8-10 in the past.

4. When {a l } is the exponential filter, {f k,l } is a combination of the 4 most recent days (mostly the current day, very little by the fourth day). We subtract an average of the past values (mostly days 6 -11 in the past).

In Figure 2 , the numbers within the parentheses at the top of each panel show the value of the threshold τ k,0.03 , calculated using the normal approximation used in the Appendix (equation 10), assuming an innovation variance of = 1 for the process. We examine the effects upon the sensitivity, specificity, and timeliness to detect anthrax outbreaks in the simulations that we present later.

We fit the chest radiograph model given by (1) to the first ten months of data for each ED in city k. After specifying a model for {R k,t }, we have a regression model with time series errors, that can be fit using standard maximum likelihood methods. We selected the order of the SARIMA model for the time series errors, {X k,t }, as defined by (4) in the Appendix using standard identification techniques based on the sample autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation (e.g., [18] ). To facilitate the comparison of the time series models across cities, we restricted to same order of model for each series. The orders p k = 1 and q k = 1, correspond to a single autoregressive and moving average term on the daily scale, equivalent to observing an autoregressive process of first order with measurement error ( [19] , Exercise 2.9). With a seasonal period of seven days (s = 7), we set P k = 1 and Q k = 1, so that the random seasonal component is a combination of an autoregressive and moving average term, each of first order over a period of seven days. The seasonal component of the time series model corresponds to an evolution of a first order autoregressive process with a measurement error over the weeks.

The model fit for the data in each city was assessed using diagnostic plots (time series plots, normal quantile plots, autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots, and the spectral estimates) of the estimated innovations of the time series component. Figure 3 shows some of these diagnostic plots for the Akron data (the residuals plots for the other cities were similar). Except for a few extremely positive values, the estimated time series looks stationary. The normal approximation is good, as evidenced by the straight line on the normal quantile plot. The plots of the sample autocorrelation and partial autocorrelations functions of the time series innovations lie inside the dotted confidence bounds for a white noise process (i.e., are samples of uncorrelated time series errors).

The parameter estimates for each city are summarized in 

In the simulations described in this section we used the following experimental design. For each city, we fit the

regression time series model using the first ten months of data (training data). We used the second half of the data from November 1st, 2003 onwards and added outbreakrelated counts to test for the detection of an outbreak signature.

We simulated an outbreak, as previously described, 500 times on 500 individuals using an attack rate of 0.5. The first day of the outbreak was randomly picked from a uniform distribution in the period December 5th, 2003 to June 22nd, 2004. (Making the earliest date later than November 1st, 2003, guarantees enough data for the filter-based methods to work with a prediction window of m = 28 days). In the absence of other information (e.g., Buckeridge, et al. [16] do not report their probabilities) we set the ED utilization probabilities to be: P d = 0.25 (weekday entry probability at the prodromal stage); P w = 0.4 (weekend entry probability at the prodromal stage) and P f = 0.80 (entry probability at the fulminant stage). The daily drop-out probability was set at 0.05. We assumed that with probability 0.9, the infected persons that enter the ED for the first time during a given outbreak receive a chest radiograph, i.e., 10% of the infected persons are misdiagnosed at the first visit. In a subsequent visit, 5% of the infected persons that re-enter the ED are misdiagnosed. The misdiagnosis additive factor, C, was assumed to be 0.05. We added the counts from the ED visits and subsequent number of chest radiographs generated from the healthcare utilization model on each day during the outbreak period. Let {O k,t } denote the number of chest radi- 

ographs attributable to the anthrax attack on day t. Since each simulated outbreak will be different, we start by summarizing the distribution of {O k,t }. Figure 4 shows a plot of the 0.025, 0.5 (i.e., median), and 0.975 quantiles calculated over the 500 simulated realizations for each day t.

Examining the progression of the quantiles over time allows us to explore the center and tails of the extra radiograph count distribution. The counts increase rapidly in the first week, then stay fairly constant (except for the spikes), for a week and then slowly drop to zero after the second week. The small spikes are due to the different probabilities of entry in the prodromal stage. Although the shapes at each quantile are similar, the magnitude and duration of the extra radiographs counts differ. The counts drop to zero at different time points for the different quantiles. They drop to zero after 3 weeks for the 0.025 quantile, after 4 weeks for the 0.5 quantile, and after 7 weeks for the 0.975 quantile. These patterns in the observed time-varying distribution of the outbreak signature are a strong motivation to not use deterministic outbreak patterns, as used by some authors, since deterministic outbreak patterns do not give a realistic assessment of detection methods.

We declare that there is evidence of an outbreak signature in the radiograph data at time t if the outbreak process D k,t , defined by (2), exceeds a given threshold, τ k,α . Suppose that {Y k,t } is the process defined as the sum of {O k,t }, the extra radiograph counts attributable to the outbreak, and the radiograph process {R k,t } that follows model (1) . Removing the non-stationary part due to the estimated effect of the covariates yields By applying the filter to this series we obtain the detection process that we would observe in the presence of extra counts attributable to an outbreak:

To examine the effect of the filter upon the outbreak signature we examine the standardized quantity for the filters that we defined previously. We set α = 0.03, which corresponds to a false alarm rate of one per month [2] . Then, as shown in the Appendix, the threshold, τ k,α , is chosen by solving P(D k,t > τ k,α ) = α for τ k,α . Either we can estimate this value from the data using the 1 -α quantile of the {D k,t } process of non-outbreak-based training data, or via a normal approximation, given by (10) . There were some differences between the values of τ k,α for the two methods in the simulations we studied. We chose the normal approximation method as it tended to preserve the specificity across the filters and EDs that we considered.

Scaling g k,t by τ k,0.03 and using the same simulated radiograph realizations due to the outbreak, allow us to compare the filtered signals consistently across filters.

The filtered series will be different for each simulated outbreak pattern realization. Just as in Figure 4 with the radiograph series, we calculate the 0.025, 0.5 (median), and 0.975 quantiles of the filtered radiograph series on each day t, based on the model fit to the Akron ED series. Figure  5 shows the time-varying quantiles for each of the four filters. Relative to the no-outbreak situation, positive values

denote those time points for which there would be a greater chance of setting off a detection. Negative values denote the time periods that would actually decrease the chance of a detection. Except for the 0.975 quantile of the 1-day filter, each quantile of the filtered signal drops below zero for a period, and stabilizes at zero after that.

There are some similarities in the shapes of the three quantiles presented in Figures 4 and 5 . Namely, the filtered signals increase over the first week, and then slowly decrease. The spikes in the distributions of the original signal are preserved for the 1-day filter, smoothed out for the 7-day filter, and partial smoothed over for the linear and exponential filters. Smoothing out the spikes tends to lead more sustained peaks (i.e., wider periods of higher sensitivity). The power of detection is smaller for the 1-day and 7-day than the linear and the exponential (as witnessed by smaller maximum heights in each of these stwo curves). For all filters, a drop below zero occurs immediately after the peaks; the counts go slowly back to zero. Periods for which the filtered signals are below zero inhibit detection and thus can mislead the prediction of the end of the outbreak signature.

We calculated the proportion of true non-detects in the absence of an outbreak signature, based on the test data (the specificity), as well as the proportion of true detects during the outbreak (the sensitivity) averaging over the 500 simulated anthrax outbreaks, for each filter and city.

We calculated the actual specificity and sensitivity using the test data, for values of α, in the range 0.01 to 0.10 in steps of 0.005. Figure 6 displays the difference of actual specificity (calculated using the training data) and the nominal specificity (predetermined 1 -α) for different values of α. Curves above or below the horizontal dotted line at zero, indicate departures from the nominal α. The Chicago series preserves the nominal value of the specificity (curves are clustered around the zero line). For the Minneapolis-St.Paul series the actual specificity is biased downwards, and for the other cities, the departure from the nominal value changes as α increases. The choice of filter affected the calibration. To understand the tradeoff between the specificity and the sensitivity we show the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, for each city, in Figure 7 . For all cities, the 1-day filter has the poorest sensitivity. Except for Milwaukee, the 7-day filter tends to have higher sensitivities compared to the other filters, but also tends to have the poorest specificity. The exponential filter balances the specificity-sensitivity tradeoff. Tables 2 and 3 display, respectively, the median and maximum detection times for each filter and city for our model. The 1-day filter performed poorly. The other filters are more comparable. We observed (results not shown) that the time to detection increases if the attack rate is reduced and also if the probabilities of entering the ED is delayed.

We now compare the performance of our model, as defined by equation (1)

Plots of the day-byday quantiles of the filtered radiograph counts attributable to an anthrax attack, based on 500 simulated anthrax outbreaks. The filtering operation, as defined by (3), is based on the first ten months of training data from Akron, in combination with one of four filters (1-day, 7-day, linear and exponential). Each filtered signal is scaled by τ k, 0.03 , calculated using a normal approximation, for comparisons to be made across filters. The biases in the specificity Figure 6 The biases in the specificity.

MinnStPaul day filter had specificities furthest away). Except for Columbus, Model 1 achieved a specificity closer to the nominal value across all EDs (Model 3 outperforms Model 1 in Columbus). Except in Chicago, Model 4 had the largest magnitude of bias. Figure 9 compares the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves for the four models across the five EDs using the linear filter (Across all models, the sensitivity for the 1-day filter was the lowest while the 7-day and linear filters tended to have the highest sensitivity). To readily compare the models, we use one minus the nominal specificity on the x-axis. Except for Akron and Minneapolis/ St. Paul, the random weekly and daily time series components in Model 1 yield higher sensitivities, compared to including a day-of-week covariate plus ARMA errors in Model 2, and day-of-week covariate plus no ARMA errors in Model 3. This is due to the insignificance of the day-ofweek fixed effect in Models 2 and 3. In Akron, Model 3 has higher sensitivities than Model 1, suggesting that the time series errors are less relevant in outbreak signature detection for the test data. In Minneapolis/St. Paul Models 1, 2, and 3 have equivalent sensitivities. Across all cities either Model 2 or Model 4 had the lowest sensivities, indicating that these models are less reliable for outbreak signature detection.

In terms of sensitivity, except for Chicago, Model 3 tended to outperform Model 2 for all filters in the cities we studied. This is counter-intuitive, as we would expect that a model that includes the significant ARMA time series component (Model 2) should outperform one that did not contain any time series components (Model 3). In practice there is a tradeoff between estimation and prediction. Table 4 displays the Akaike information criterions (AICs) for the four models, fit to the training data of the five EDs. For each ED, a smaller AIC denotes a model that better fits the data. Model 3 performed better than Model 2 in one-step-ahead predictions (Figure 9 ), but Model 2 better explains the training data than Model 3 (Table 4 ).

Using the AIC we find Model 1 fits best to the training data, even though it does not always yield the highest sensitivity.

Our intention in this study was to find a flexible set of statistical models that could be applied across a number of emergency departments. We employ time series models that include covariates, such as patient visit counts and ambient temperature, as well as random seasonal terms. We use chest-radiograph ordering data from emergency departments of five regional Midwest children's hospitals to detect signatures of respiratory outbreaks. We include visit counts series as a covariate in the chest radiograph model to account for variations due to, for example, ED sizes, changes of staff within the ED, and even some seasonalities across the time period of interest. We use the temperature series as a surrogate measure of the influenza season -the colder months in the western hemisphere. This is a more accurate measure of the influenza season than using a fixed covariate such as a sinusoid. To reflect uncertainty in the variation of the influenza background over seasons, these models allow for randomness in the seasonal components. The use of random seasonal components is an advantage over traditional fixed effect models, since temporal patterns are not assumed to repeat precisely the same way. Thus, signature detection capabilities are improved for the majority of EDs -sensitivity is higher. For increased accuracy and timeliness, the use of our model for the data analysis should represent one component of an integrated detection system. Once a signal is triggered by any of our models, we recommend the use of clinical follow-up to corroborate or refute the emergence of a bona fide epidemic. For example, radiographs and medical charts will need to be reviewed to identify highly anomalous findings or groupings of aberrant findings that would be expected to be present at early stages of outbreaks. We believe that the approach utilized in this work will aid in this process and is more appropriate than models using fixed periodicities that do not have the ability to capture the underlying variabilities across seasons.

Of note, our study shows that there are similarities in the chest radiographs series from different EDs that can, for the most part, be modeled by similar time series models. Similarities of the time series model across EDs have a number of ramifications for detection of outbreak signatures. First, by borrowing information across the different EDs we can build more complicated multivariate time series models, possibly involving the joint modeling of chest radiograph and visit counts across locations. Second, we could use these models to jointly detect outbreak signatures across large spatial regions. In this context, Diggle et al. [20] use spatio-temporal Cox models to identify anomalies (real and artificial outbreaks) in the space-time distribution of gastrointestinal infections. But, some caution is needed because one potential drawback of aggregating data spatially is that the chance of detection can be reduced (data from unaffected areas will mask the outbreak signature, and increase the detection time) [21] . For localized outbreaks, there is still some utility in building models that borrow strength across EDs, even if the joint detection of outbreak signatures is not meaningful. In terms of these localized outbreaks, a geographically close site could act as a benchmark to judge detections at other sites. For example, under certain circumstances an epidemic detection signal triggered in Columbus, but not in Akron, could imply that some unusual event had occurred in Columbus. It should be noted, however, that even though there are similarities in the time series models, our simulations demonstrate that the sensitivity and timeliness to detect outbreak signatures using chest radiograph counts were different across EDs. These differences may limit the utility of our models in comparing signals across different EDs.

Our study has a number of limitations. We assume that the resulting series {X k,t }, after accounting for these covariates, is stationary. We also ignore the fact that an individual may have multiple ED visits. Furthermore, these data do not contain any known anthrax outbreaks. Instead, outbreak patterns are simulated using a simple stochastic model. Although more care needs to be taken when summarizing simulation results, we agree with Buckeridge, et al. [16] and Brookmeyer, et al. [17] that stochastic outbreaks are more realistic than deterministic ones. Other results (not presented here) indicate that the results are different (and possibly misleading) with a smooth deterministic outbreak rather than a stochastic one. We utilize the four filters used by Reis, et al. [2] . Although filter design is an active area of research, especially in engineering, we decided to only study these four simple and fairly easy to understand filters. In the future we could extend our analysis to different choices of filter. We view wavelet-based biosurveillance methods [1, 8] as extensions of this idea to different linear time-invariant filters. An important issue in filter-based-prediction methods is the choice of covariates and the correlation structure for the time series model. Clearly, the properties of the time series model could change with time. One way to improve the prediction of outbreak signatures is to use time-varying models, with parameters that slowly evolve over time. The use of time-varying parameter models is analogous to a periodic review of the parameter values. Window-based estimation methods could be used to re-estimate the model parameters. In this case, the choice of window length is critical as it represents a compromise between the efficiency to estimate the model parameters, and the sensitivity and specificity of detection. Other issues to be taken into account include negative singularities (as defined by [8] ) that can cause a drop in the sensitivity. Abnormal points (like holidays or severe weather) can cause "false alarms". Our solution to this problem is to jointly model chest radiograph and visit counts. So far, we have assumed that the visit counts are observed without error. Related to these issues, we are investigating methods that can be used to incorporate the uncertainty in parameter estimation upon the detection procedure.

We present in this paper a stochastic model of chest radiograph ordering patterns and temperature as an adjunct to a biosurveillance system for detecting emerging respiratory-related epidemics, focusing on a potentially highimpact public health hazard such as inhalational anthrax. We show that in time series analysis of respiratory-related data it is important to capture important seasonal effects that are present in such data, as well as to consider the influence of important covariates that can be easily obtained and incorporated into the models. We also demonstrate the importance in assessing the sensitivity and specificity of these methods, of utilizing more realistic stochastic, rather than deterministic, models for outbreaks patterns. We demonstrate spatial homogeneity in chest radiograph data across EDs and suggest ways in which these observations may be used to improve regional biosurveillance for (re)emergent infections.

Regardless of the choice of filter, our simulations demonstrate that the specificity calculated using the training data The biases in the specificity for the four models Figure 8 The biases in the specificity for the four models. A plot of the actual specificity (the specificity calculated using the training data) minus the nominal specificity (1 -α) for different values of α using a linear filter, for four different models.

Receiver operating characteristic curves (averaged over 500 simulations of an anthrax outbreak) for the detection of the anthrax outbreak signature in the chest radiographs at each of the five metropolitan children's hospitals using the four different models. The linear filter is used in each case. MinnStPaul varied across the five EDs studied ( Figure 6 ). The tradeoff between specificity and sensitivity also varied by the ED (Figures 6 and 7) . The 1-day filter, while closely matching the nominal specificity, performed poorly in terms of maximizing the sensitivity to detect an outbreak signature. The 7-day filter, by smoothing over the outbreak signature ( Figure 5 ), maximized the sensitivity, but at a compromise to the actual specificity obtained (Figures 6  and 7) . The linear and exponential filters provided a balance between the specificity and sensitivity. Detection using our covariate-based seasonal time series model performed well across all EDs compared with fixed-effects regression models or time series models that omitted seasonal terms and/or covariates (Figures 8 and 9 ). denotes the one-step ahead prediction for the SARIMA process and {b k,1 , ..., b k,m } are obtained from the solution of the set of m linear equations:

The one-step prediction error process, {E k,t } is where we define c k,0 = 1 and c k,j = -b k,j for j = 1, ..., m. The process {E k,t } is a filtering of {X k,t } and so if {X k,t } is stationary, by the linear time invariant filtering result for stationary processes, {E k,t } is also stationary ( [18] , Theorem 4.10.1). Moreover for large enough m, if {X k,t } is an invertible time series process then we can approximate {X k,t } by an autoregressive, AR(m) process ( [18] , Theorem 4.4.3). Using this approximation we can argue that {E k,t } is approximately a mean zero Gaussian independent and identically distributed process with variance gamma γ X,k (0). Let {a 0 , ..., a L-1 } denote a pre-specified filter of width L. We define the detection process {D k,t } by filtering the error process {E k,t } using this filter. Thus, By the filtering result for stationary processes, stationarity of {X k,t } implies that {D k,t } is also a stationary process.

For large enough m, since {E k,t } is approximately a white noise process,{D k,t } is approximately a moving average process of order L -1 with coefficients θ 0 = 1, θ j = a j-1 /a 0 for j = 1, ..., L -1, and innovation variance .

We declare evidence of an outbreak signature (test positive), at time t if the observed detection value D k,t is larger than a given threshold. For a fixed value of α, let 1 -α denote the specificity (the probability of a true-negative). Similarly, the sensitivity is defined to be the probability of true positive. The threshold, τ k,α , is chosen by solving P (D k,t > τ k,α ) = α for τ k,α . Either we can estimate this value from the data using the 1 -α quantile of the {D k,t } process of non-outbreak-based training data, or if {X k,t } is Gaussian then for large m,

where Z is a standard normal random variable. The solution for the threshold under this approximation is where Φ -1 (·) denotes the inverse cumulative distribution function for a standard normal random variable.

The filter-based detection method requires knowledge of the "true" values of the model parameters. In our work, we replace the parameters with their maximum likelihood estimates.

Emerging Microbes & Infections (2017) 6, e42

Feline panleukopenia is a contagious disease commonly characterized by severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis and leukopenia, and it is associated with a high rate of morbidity in cats. 1 The disease is caused by feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV), which belongs to the feline parvovirus subgroup within the genus Parvovirus (family Parvoviridae), together with canine parvovirus (CPV) and other parvoviruses of carnivores. 2 FPLV can infect domestic cats and other Felidae species, as well as species of the families Mustelidae, Procyonidae and Viverridae. 3 FPLV infections in large carnivores, such as captive tigers and lions, have been described based on clinical, serological and virological data. [4] [5] [6] [7] However, the number of FPLV strains isolated from the adaptive carnivore species and the molecular information associated with these isolates are very limited. Clinical and etiological investigations are very important for discovering the mechanism(s) underlying the genetic evolution and pathogenicity of FPLV.

In this study, we report an outbreak of fatal FPLV infection among captive Southeast tigers (Panthera tigris altaica) in the Zhengzhou Zoo in central China. A novel FPLV strain was successfully isolated from these tigers. The tigers had been administered two doses of a vaccine (Nobivac Tricat, Intervet) against FPLV at three and four months of age. On 6 June 2016, a 5-month-old tiger presented with non-specific signs of infection, including fever, lethargy and anorexia. Subsequently, the tiger began to vomit and developed watery to hemorrhagic diarrhea later in the course of the disease, and transmitted the disease to nine additional tigers and lions (all between five to eight months of age) that were housed in the same or adjacent rooms. The animals failed to respond to antibiotic and supportive therapy, and five tigers died less than two days after the onset of diarrhea. The gross findings at necropsy in the tigers revealed diffuse fibrinous enteritis with dilatation of the intestine primarily affecting the ileum. The intestinal lumen contained a dense pinkish liquid with abundant epithelial debris and fibrin, as well as severe hemorrhagic enteritis with marked turgidity of the wall of the ileum. In addition, there was hemorrhaging and edema in the lungs, diffuse bleeding in the kidneys and bleeding spots and necrotic foci on the surface of the heart (Supplementary Figure S1 ).

To identify the major cause of death among the tigers, the presence of parvovirus, rotavirus, coronavirus and canine distemper virus in fecal, intestinal and blood samples of the dead tigers with enteritis was evaluated by PCR, RT-PCR, and sequencing and by inoculation of cell cultures for virus isolation. Our results showed that only FPLV was detected in the samples. The filtered homogenates of positive intestinal samples were used to inoculate a Crandell-Rees feline kidney cell monolayer as described previously. 6, 7 Cytopathogenic effects were observed in infected Crandell-Rees feline kidney cells beginning 36 h post inoculation (Supplementary Figure S2) . The presence of parvovirus in the supernatant of the cell cultures was confirmed by PCR. An FPLV strain, designated HN-ZZ1, was purified from the supernatant of the cell cultures by plaque assay, and the viral genome was sequenced by the Shanghai Sangon Biotechnology Company. The full-length genome of HN-ZZ1 comprises 4688 nucleotides (nt) and has been deposited in GenBank (accession number KX685354.1). Bioinformatic analysis of the viral sequence predicted that the HN-ZZ1 isolate encodes four proteins, including two nonstructural proteins, NS1 (nt 114-2120) and NS2 (nt 114-373 and 1846-2083), and two structural proteins, VP1 (nt 2127-2158 and 2223-4382) and VP2 (nt 2628-4382). The nucleotide sequence of HN-ZZ1 is closely related to viruses previously isolated from domestic cats in China and shows the highest identity (99.2%) with FPLV strain HRB-CS1, which was isolated from a dead domestic cat with enteritis in 2014 in Heilongjiang Province in northeastern China. Phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome of the HN-ZZ1 strain and 25 reference strains (Supplementary Table S1) showed that HN-ZZ1 was clustered in the FPLV branch but was also closely related to the CPV branch (Supplementary Figure S3) .

Genetic recombination is generally considered to be a key mechanism underlying the generation and evolution of parvoviruses. Coinfection with multiple parvovirus strains has occurred, potentially facilitating recombination and leading to high genetic heterogeneity. 8 Recently, a Japanese research group provided clear evidence of recombination between CPV and FPLV under field conditions. 9 Interestingly, an analysis of the HN-ZZ1 sequence with the recombination detection programs RDP3 and GARD suggested that the HN-ZZ1 strain is a novel recombinant virus between CPV and FPLV. The RDP3 program identified nt position 2696 as an ending breakpoint, and a predicted recombination region was located around positions 1328 and 2696 of the alignment. Among the nucleotide sequence data for all 25 strains entered the RDP3 program, this part possessed the greatest similarity (99.3%) to the corresponding part of CPV-2b strain CPV-447 isolated from Germany (Supplementary Figure S4) . The GARD program identified nt position 2558 as a putative breakpoint for recombination. The alignment was cut at this point, and separate phylogenies for each section of HN-ZZ1 were constructed. The first half of the fragment aligned with the clade containing CPV, while the latter half of the fragment aligned with the clade containing FPLV. In addition to the HN-ZZ1 strain isolated in the tigers, there is strong evidence supporting recombination events in the genomic sequences of MEV_LN-10 previously isolated from mink, and XJ-1 and HRB-CS1 previously isolated from cats in China. [10] [11] [12] Phylogenetic analysis of the VP2 gene of the HN-ZZ1 strain and 21 reference strains showed that the VP2 gene of HN-ZZ1 aligned with the FPLV branch originating in Felidae and clustered in the FPLV branch. This study also indicated that the VP2 gene of HN-ZZ1 showed a relatively distant relationship from those of the Purevax and Felocell vaccine strains. We speculated that the differences in the VP2 genes between the wild type and vaccine strains may be one of the factors underlying the failure of vaccination against FPLV. 13 Interestingly, the nucleotide sequence of the NS1 gene was more closely related to the CPV branch originating in dogs and clustered with virus strains in the CPV branch ( Figure 1A) . We analyzed host-specific sites of key amino acids in the VP2 protein of the HN-ZZ1 strain and found that the amino acids at positions 80, 93, 103, 300, 305, 323, 564 and 568 of VP2 were identical to those of FPLV reference strains. However, the NS1 protein of the HN-ZZ1 strain had amino-acid characteristics of CPV, with the exception of the amino acid at position 248 ( Figure 1B) . 6 An analysis using other evolutionary models, such as the Jukes-Cantor method, produced trees with nearly identical topologies (data not shown).

Our data herein suggest that HN-ZZ1 is a novel recombinant parvovirus between CPV and FPLV, and the recombinant virus Figure 1 The results of the phylogenetic analysis of the VP2 and NS1 genes from the HN-ZZ1 strain and the deduced amino-acid sequence characterization.

If this virus is epidemic, it will place wild and captive animals at increased risk. Although the role of this recombination event between CPV and FPLV in viral pathogenicity is unknown, our preliminary infection studies confirmed the high virulence of this recombinant virus. The intranasal infection studies in six 3-month-old cats with the HN-ZZ1 isolate resulted in anorexia, vomiting and fever in the affected animals at 2day post infection. Subsequently, the cats began to display severe vomiting and developed watery to hemorrhagic diarrhea, which resulted in nearly 100% mortality in affected cats at 4-6 days post infection. Gross examinations showed that the affected cats were characterized by mild to severe fibrinous to fibrinomucoid enteritis with thickened mucosa, with bleeding spots on the surface of the heart, liver, lungs and spleen (data not shown). At present, the number of strains from Zoo animals that have been characterized by molecular methods are very limited, as can be observed by the scarce complete VP2 sequences available in GenBank. With the emergence and continuous increase of recombinant parvoviruses, our ongoing studies will investigate the geographic distribution of these viruses, monitor their recombination characteristics, identify their virulence determinants by reverse genetics and develop efficient strategies against these novel viruses.

Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of human metapneumovirus strains from Kenya and Zambia

Background: Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is an important cause of acute respiratory illness in young children. Whole genome sequencing enables better identification of transmission events and outbreaks, which is not always possible with sub-genomic sequences.

Results: We report a 2-reaction amplicon-based next generation sequencing method to determine the complete genome sequences of five HMPV strains, representing three subgroups (A2, B1 and B2), directly from clinical samples. In addition to reporting five novel HMPV genomes from Africa we examined genetic diversity and sequence patterns of publicly available HMPV genomes. We found that the overall nucleotide sequence identity was 71.3 and 80% for HMPV group A and B, respectively, the diversity between HMPV groups was greater at amino acid level for SH and G surface protein genes, and multiple subgroups co-circulated in various countries. Comparison of sequences between HMPV groups revealed variability in G protein length (219 to 241 amino acids) due to changes in the stop codon position. Genome-wide phylogenetic analysis showed congruence with the individual gene sequence sets except for F and M2 genes.

Conclusion: This is the first genomic characterization of HMPV genomes from African patients.

Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a single-stranded RNA virus in the family Paramyxoviridae and closely related to human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [1] . HMPV causes respiratory disease similar to RSV, ranging from mild upper respiratory infection to bronchiolitis and pneumonia [2] . HMPV infections are seasonal and coinfection with other respiratory pathogens is common [1] . The HMPV genome is approximately 13 kb and comprises eight open reading frames (ORFs) encoding nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion glycoprotein (F), transcription enhancer protein (M2), small hydrophobic protein (SH), attachment glycoprotein (G), and large polymerase protein (L) [3] . The membrane glycoproteins F and G sequences are used to define two major genotypes or groups, A and B, which are further classified into four subgroups (A1, A2, B1, and B2). HMPV A2, the most frequently observed subgroup, is further divided into two proposed sub-lineages (A2a and A2b) [3] .

HMPV is reported to have an important contribution to acute respiratory infections (ARI) in Africa. For instance, HMPV-associated hospitalization was estimated at 6.5 per 1000 person years in infants in Soweto, South Africa [4] ; at 4% in hospitalized children with severe ARI during a 2-year period in Cameroon [5] ; and in rural western Kenya, incidence of HMPV associated with ARI cases in outpatient clinic visits was estimated at 0.43 per 100 person-years among outpatients [6] . In Kilifi coastal Kenya, between January 2007 to December 2011, children under 6 months of age accounted for 44% of HMPV positive cases, while 74% were children under 1 year, and 1.3% (2/160) were children > 36 months [7] . In Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps in Kenya, HMPV was detected in 5.7% hospitalizations, and virus-positive crude hospitalization rate (per 1000 children < 5 years old) was 4 for HMPV [8] . In Mali, contribution of HMPV to pneumonia had a population attributable fraction of 9% (95% CI: 7-11%) [9] ; while in Morocco [10] , 8 .9% of children < 5 years admitted with severe pneumonia were infected with HMPV. HMPV prevalence and incidence elsewhere globally, is indicated in Additional file 4: Table S1 . Of note is that the variations in incidence rates could be attributed to study population, seasonality and even detection methods. Nonetheless, genomic epidemiology of HMPV in Africa is inadequately reported, and comparison of genetic similarity and differences between African and global strains is not documented.

Genome sequences provide valuable resources for characterizing viral evolution and disease epidemiology, and for identifying transmission events and outbreaks, which is not always possible with sub-genomic fragments [11] [12] [13] . The increased number of phylogenetically informative variant sites obtained from full genomes may allow better linking of cases and aid public health interventions in real time during epidemics [14, 15] . PCR approaches for targeted whole genome sequencing, in contrast to random amplification, can preferentially amplify the target virus over host or environmental nucleic acids [16, 17] potentially focusing sequencing on the virus of interest. To date, the largest dataset of HMPV whole genomes (n = 61) sequenced from any tropical country is from three Peruvian cities, Lima, Piura and Iquitos [18] . In Africa, apart from one metapneumovirus genome identified from a wild mountain gorilla in Rwanda (GenBank accession number HM197719), there are no HMPV genomes reported according to the NIAID Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR, http://www.viprbrc. org/, accessed April 30, 2019). This has led to limited understanding of the genetic and genomic diversity of HMPV in the continent.

This work describes a whole genome sequencing (WGS) approach for HMPV from a small number of HMPV positive clinical samples collected at Kilifi County Hospital in Kilifi, Kenya and University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia. The genomes were generated by sequencing overlapping PCR amplicons spanning the entire genome. These are the first reported complete genome sequences of locally circulating HMPV strains obtained directly from clinical samples in Africa. We also combined the new genomes with publicly available sequences to examine patterns in global HMPV genetic diversity.

Whole genome sequencing was successful for all 5 clinical samples that were attempted. A single genomic sequence was obtained from each sample, and the length of the 5 new HMPV genomes ranged from 13,097 to 13, 134 nt (> 95% length coverage). Sequencing and data assembly parameters, including coverage depth are shown in Table 1 .

Sequence annotation of the full-length genomes using Geneious R8.1.5 (https://www.geneious.com) identified the expected eight coding ORFs and non-coding genomic regions. The overall nucleotide identity (i.e., identical sites averaging over all sequence pairs and excluding positions containing gaps) between all 143 genome sequences analyzed (5 new genomes plus 138 from ViPR) was 58.2%. Nucleotide sequence identity was 71.3% within HMPV-A and 80% within HMPV-B. Intrasubgroup, A1, A2, B1 and B2 genomes shared 92.1% (10 sequences), 76.8% (88 sequences), 91% (24 sequences) and 89.6% (21 sequences) amino acid sequence identity.

For the 143 HMPV genomes, we checked sequence conservation at transcriptional control regions, at the termini of each gene, as well as the lengths of intergenic sequences between gene boundaries. The length of the F-M2 intergenic region was different between group A and B viruses, that is, 13 nt and 2 nt, respectively. The SH-G and G-L intergenic regions were the longest, up to 125 nt and to 190 nt, respectively. Consensus nucleotides (9 to 19 length) at the putative start and end regions flanking the ORF of the viral genes are shown in Fig. 1 . The gene-start and -end regions of N and P were conserved (> 90% average pairwise identity) in both HMPV groups, and the M2 and M gene-start and -end were also conserved in HMPV group A and B, respectively. The putative ATG start codon was consistently located at positions 14-16 upstream of a gene start motif (consensus: GG/AGAC/TAAA/GTnnnnATG), except for the internal M2-2. An additional ATG start codon upstream of the gene-start motif was observed in the SH gene for the B1 and B2 strains. In five of the eight annotated genes (N, P, F, M2, and G (B1 and B2 strains only)), the intergenic regions were short and the ORFs for these 5 genes terminated within the propositioned gene-end motifs.

We combined the five genome sequences from Kenya and Zambia with available global sequences, aligned individual genes and calculated the percent nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) identity ( Table 2) .

The coding sequences of N, M, F, M2-1, M2-2, and L genes were conserved at nucleotide and amino acid levels, by sharing > 85% between-subgroup nucleotide identity and 90% protein identity ( Table 3 ). The nucleoprotein gene was the most conserved among all subgroups at the nt and aa levels. SH and G glycoprotein genes were more divergent between the HMPV subgroups at the nucleotide level with 76 and 63% identity, respectively. The SH protein length was variable between group A and B strains due to a nucleotide substitution (CAA ➔ TAA) at gene position 532 in group B, resulting in protein lengths of 178 and 180 aa, respectively. The predicted G protein length also varied among the different HMPV subgroups, between 219 and 241 aa, due to different positions of the Stop codon. Amino acid sequence diversity for G and SH glycoproteins is depicted in Fig. 2 and Additional file 2: Figure S2 , respectively. The diversity of the complete nucleotide sequences of SH and G genes is depicted in phylogenetic trees in Fig. 3 .

We evaluated phylogenetic classification and relationship between the 5 new genomes obtained in this study and previously published genomes (Fig. 3) . Full genome Figure S3 . There was phylogenetic congruence with the individual gene sequence sets as with the full genome dataset, except for F and M2 gene (Additional file 3: Figure S3 ).

Variant or drifted viral strains may lower the sensitivity of detection resulting in a decreased quantitation of the viral load and underestimation of disease incidence [19] . We checked the new HMPV genomes for nucleotide differences in the genomic regions targeted by our diagnostic rRT-PCR primers and probes (Additional file 7: Table S4 ) used for HMPV detection. Up to eight primer-and probetemplate mismatches were identified (Fig. 4) : one mismatch in the forward primer region in HMPV group A (F gene-based rRT-PCR assay, Fig. 4a ); one mismatch in each of the forward and probe target regions in group B (F gene-based rRT-PCR assay, Fig. 4b) ; and 5 different mismatches with the N-gene based rRT-PCR assay (Fig. 4c) . Note, the F gene-based rRT-PCR assays are different or specific to the two HMPV groups.

HMPV causes respiratory illness presenting as mild upper respiratory tract infection or life-threatening severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia primarily in children, sometimes adults as well as immunocompromised individuals [2] . However, HMPV genome sequence data from Africa is sparse and information on genome-wide diversity is limited. In the present study, the whole genome sequences of five HMPV strains from Kenya and Zambia were determined and compared with the genomes published previously from around the world. Comparative sequence analysis indicated fairly conserved positioning of the gene-start and -end regions as well as translational start and -end codons. Variation in genestart and -end sequences can have significant impact on transcription initiation and termination efficiency so that there is more selective pressure preventing changes in these regions [20] , and this likely explains our observation. The additional ATG start codon found upstream of the gene-start motif of the SH gene was consistent with a previous report [21] , though its role in gene expression is yet to be identified.

These observed sequence conservation in N, M, F, M2-1, M2-2, and L genes is not unusual and is suggestive of functional and structural constraints on diversity, but less expected of the F gene because of its status as a neutralization and protective antigen, similar to its close 'relative' RSV [22] . It has also been suggested that the low diversity in F gene might make a substantial contribution to cross-neutralization and cross-protection between the HMPV subgroups [21] . The relatively high frequency of amino acid diversity in G (and to a lesser extent SH) could be attributable to selective pressure for amino acid change coming from host immunity; and the ability of the protein to tolerate substitutions, which might be due to its proposed extended, unfolded nature [22] . The phylogenetic incongruence observed between whole genome tree and the F and G gene trees, is as reported previously for HMPV [23] , and could be attributed to differential rates of evolution, selection pressure or past recombination events [24] . The prevalence of HMPV in hospitalized pediatric population in Kilifi county in coastal Kenya has been reported [7, 25] . However, it is notable that in recent years, HMPV has been detected at low prevalence in Kilifi (unpublished observations from hospital-based pneumonia surveillance). Whether this low prevalence is due to reduced virus transmission, or decreased sensitivity of our HMPV molecular diagnostic assay due to progressive primer/probe mismatches, is yet to be established.

We present the first full genome sequences of circulating HMPV strains from sub-Saharan Africa. A limitation of our sequencing method, as is common with amplicon sequencing protocols [26, 27] , was absent coverage at the 3′ leader and 5′ trailer regions not captured by these primers. Our results demonstrate the application of amplicon sequencing to generate full length HMPV genomes directly from clinical samples. The observed diversity of the individual genes is comparable to that described previously [20] [21] [22] . This method and data provide a useful reference for design of local molecular diagnostics and for studies aimed at understanding HMPV epidemiology and evolution in Africa.

Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP-OP) swab samples were collected from children (1-59 months) hospitalized with pneumonia, four of whom were enrolled in the PERCH study [18] in 2012. The fifth sample was collected from a child enrolled in the routine pneumonia surveillance study at Kilifi County Hospital, Kenya, in 2015. The samples were tested for HMPV by multiplex semi-quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) assays. The rRT-PCR primers and probes used, cycling conditions and assay set up have been described elsewhere [28, 29] . Fusion (F) and glycoprotein (G) encoding genes of the HMPV positive samples were amplified in a one-step RT-PCR assay (OneStep RT-PCR kit, QIAGEN), as described previously [7] . Partial G or F nucleotide sequences were analyzed by maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees using IQ-TREE [30] , together with reference strains of HMPV subgroups (accession numbers AF371337.2, FJ168779, AY297749, AY530095, JN184401 and AY297748). Five HMPV positive samples from the Kenya and Zambia study sites, belonging to the A2a (n = 1), A2b (n = 2), B1 (n = 1) and B2 (n = 1) genetic subgroups based on their G and F gene sequences, were selected for whole genome sequencing. Data on age, sex and clinical assessment information collected at the time of sample collection, for the five selected samples, are shown in Table 3 .

The sequencing protocol consisted of four steps as follows: (i) primer design, (ii) preparation of primer mixes, (iii) cDNA and PCR (iv) Illumina sequencing and data analysis.

All human metapneumovirus (HMPV) full genome sequences were retrieved from GenBank (January 2018) using the query (txid162145 (Organism) AND 12000(SLEN): 14000(SLEN) NOT patent). Sequence entries with gaps larger than 6 nt were excluded to generate a set of yielding 178 genomes. All possible 23 nt sequences were generated from the genomes dataset and trimmed to a final calculated melting temperature (Tm) of 47.9-49.5°C. Sequences with homology to rRNA sequences, with GC content outside < 0.3 or > 0.75 or with a single nucleotide fractional content of > 0.6 were discarded. The primer set was then made nonredundant yielding 60,746 potential primers. All potential primers were mapped against the 178 HMPV full genomes and the number of perfect matches (frequency score) was determined as a measure of primer sequence conservation. To select primers, the HMPV genome sequences were divided into amplicons with 222 nt overlap spanning the virus genome. Potential primers that mapped within the terminal 5′ and 3′ 222 nt of each amplicon were identified and the sequence with the highest frequency score was selected, and primers mapping to the reverse bins were reverse complemented. In this manner, 24 primers were selected for each of the 4 HMPV genotype representative genomes (GenBank accession number HMPV A1: AF371337, HMPV A2: FJ168779; HMPV B1: AY525843, and HMPV B2: FJ168778). Because of conservation between genotypes, there was primer redundancy which was removed. The final set of 65 primer sequences, their lengths, calculated Tm, fractional GC content and mapping position on the HMPV genome are presented in Additional file 5: Table S2 . The primers were computationally tested against each of the 4 HMPV subgroups. A graphical representation of the primer target sites is presented in Additional file 1: Figure S1 .

Amplification was performed in two reactions. To avoid generating small products from adjacent forward and reverse primers, amplicons were assigned to alternate Table 3 ).

Bootstrap support values (evaluated by 1000 replicates) are indicated along the branches. Genetic subgroups A1, A2a, A2b, B1, and B2, are indicated. Multiple sequence alignment was done using MAFFT and the ML phylogeny inferred using GTR + Γ nucleotide substitution model and ultrafast bootstrap approximation in IQ-TREE. The genotype B2 Sabana strain sequence (GenBank accession number HM197719) reported from a wild mountain gorilla in Rwanda is marked in blue. The scaled bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site reactions, with reaction 1 containing primers for amplicons 1,3,5,7,9,11; reaction 2 containing primers for amplicons 2,4,6,8,10,12. Each reverse transcription used Forward Primer Mixes (FPMs) made with 3.0 μl of each reverse primer (100 pmol/μl) plus water to 200 μl to generate a primer concentration of 24 pmol/μl. Two microlitre of the FPM is then used in a 20 μl reverse transcription reaction (2.4 pmol/μl final concentration in reaction or 2.4 μM/primer). For PCR amplification, each amplicon reaction used a separate PCR Primer Mix (PPM) containing 1.5 μl of each 100 pmol/μl forward primer and 1.5 μl of each reverse primer (5.3-5.5 pmol/μl total primer in the PPM). 2 μl PPM was used per 25 μl PCR reaction = 0.5 pmol/μl in reaction (= 500 nM).

Viral nucleic acids were extracted from the original samples using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (QIAGEN). RNA (5 μl) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript III (200 U, Invitrogen), RT buffer (1X final concentration, Invitrogen), and 2 μl of FPM in 20 μl reactions. An aliquot of cDNA (5 μl) was amplified in 35 cycles using Phusion Highfidelity PCR kit (New England Biolabs) and 2 μl of PPM in a 25 μl reaction. The PCR mixture was incubated at 98°C for 30 s, followed by 35 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 43°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 90s and a final extension of 72°C for 10 min. Expected PCR products for each amplicon were approximately 1500 bp. PCR products from the two reactions for each sample were pooled for Illumina library preparation. Fig. 4 Mismatches between the rRT-PCR diagnostic primers and probes and their expected binding sites in the five genomes from Kenya and Zambia. 'Fwd primer' = Forward primer and 'Rev primer' = Reverse primer. Two rRT-PCR assays were used for HMPV detection. The colored bars in the figure indicate nucleotide differences (mismatches) between (a) three HMPV-A genomes and HMPV-A specific primers and probes targeting fusion gene, (b) two HMPV-B genomes and HMPV-B specific primers and probes also targeting fusion gene, and (c) all five genomes reported here and specific primers and probes targeting nucleoprotein gene. The sequences of the rRT-PCR primers and probes checked against the African HMPV genomes are listed in Additional file 7: Table S4 Illumina sequencing and data analysis Libraries were prepared using Nextera XT kit (Illumina) and pair-end sequencing (2 × 300 base pairs) with the MiSeq Reagent V3 kit (Illumina), following the manufacturer's instructions. The Nextera enzyme mix was used to simultaneously fragment input DNA and tag with universal adapters in a single tube reaction, followed by 12-cycle PCR reaction for dual indexing. Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) were used for all purification steps and libraries were quantified and quality-checked using the Qubit (Thermo Fisher) and

Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Adapter trimming, quality filtering, kmer normalization of sequencing reads, de novo assembly, calculation of mean genome coverage was as previously described [31] .

A dataset of HMPV genome sequences was retrieved from ViPR in order to infer relationship between HMPV viruses from Kenya and Zambia and viral populations sampled globally. The dataset included 138 sequence entries (> 13,000 nt) that included date (year) and location of sample Table S3 ). Sequence alignment was done using MAFFT v.7.221 [32] using the parameters 'localpair -maxiterate 1000'. IQ-TREE was used to infer maximum likelihood (ML) trees of the complete genome and individual genes under general time-reversible (GTR) substitution model with gamma-distributed among-site rate heterogeneity. A summary of the methodology outlined here is depicted in Fig. 5 .
