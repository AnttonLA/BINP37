{"text": "Posttranslational modification of proteins by ubiquitin regulates synapse development and synaptic transmission . Much progress has been made investigating the role of ubiquitin ligases at the synapse , however very little is known about the deubiquitinating enzymes ( DUBs ) which remove ubiquitin from target proteins . Although there are far fewer DUBs than ubiquitin ligases encoded by the human genome , it is becoming clear that DUBs have very specific physiological functions , suggesting that DUB activity is tightly regulated in vivo . Many DUBs function as part of larger protein complexes , and multiple regulatory mechanisms exist to control the expression , localization and catalytic activity of DUBs . In this review article , we focus on the role of the DUB USP46 in the nervous system , and illustrate potential mechanisms of regulating DUBs by describing how USP46 is regulated by two WD40 - repeat ( WDR ) proteins , WDR48 / UAF1 and WDR20 , based on recent structural studies and genetic analyses in vivo .", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 46, "end": 56}, "obj": "drug"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 289, "end": 299}, "obj": "drug"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 361, "end": 371}, "obj": "drug"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 435, "end": 440}, "obj": "drug"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 710, "end": 715}, "obj": "drug"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 854, "end": 859}, "obj": "drug"}]}
