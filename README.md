# BINP37, Bioinformatics: Research Project

This repository contains the code used in my short Research Project during the Spring semester of 2020, as a part of my master's in Bioinformatics at Lund University

# Models

A collection of BioBERT models fine-tuned with several different custom small datasets can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fEm64e26l1RFmVtDqS4NhEDzCWwHQemP/view?usp=sharing
